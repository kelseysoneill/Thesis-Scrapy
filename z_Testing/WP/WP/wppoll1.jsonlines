Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) about the Democratic Party's ideals. (Reuters)", " ", " ", " ", 


 "Two Democratic parties showed up to vote in Iowa on Monday night, and with nearly all of the delegates tallied, the result is essentially a tie.", " ",

  "Entrance polling showed the Democratic party of Bernie Sanders is younger (he earned about six times as much support as Clinton from those under 30), more liberal (he got 6 in 10 of the vote from those who called themselves \u201cvery liberal\u201d) and slightly more male, according to preliminary entrance polls. The Democratic party of Hillary Clinton is older (about 7\u00a0in 10\u00a0of those over 65 backed Clinton), wealthier (only 4\u00a0in 10\u00a0of those making more than\u00a0$100,000 a year backed Sanders) more moderate and more female.", " ",
  .
  "Their motivations were different. Sanders voters wanted honesty and empathy. Clinton voters wanted experience and the ability to win in November.", " ", 

 "[", "Iowa preliminary entrance poll results", "]", " ", 

 "In 2008, Barack Obama\u2019s caucus win was powered by a surge of new voters in Iowa who accounted for a majority of the electorate. Had Sanders seen a similar surge, he\u2019d have been the clear winner, as he got the vote of about 6\u00a0in 10\u00a0of those who\u2019d never caucused before. But most voters in this year\u2019s caucuses had done so before, and a majority of them favored Clinton.", " ", 

 "The tiebreaker in future contests may be the other difference between the two Democratic parties. In Iowa, non-white voters were only about one-tenth of the electorate. Clinton won them by about 18 points.", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", "

 DEMOCRATS SPLIT ON EXPERIENCE AND TRUST", " ", 

 "Asked to evaluate the most important factor driving their support, Democratic caucus-goers in Iowa split dramatically on what they were looking for in a candidate. Among those looking for someone to beat the Republican nominee in November, about three-quarters backed Hillary Clinton. An even higher percentage of those looking for a nominee with the \u201cright experience\u201d preferred Clinton to Bernie Sanders. Together, those groups accounted for roughly half of all Democratic voters.", " "

 "Sanders, though, was strongly preferred by those looking for someone that cares about people like them, getting support from 3\u00a0out of 4\u00a0voters citing that quality. Among voters looking for an honest candidate, Sanders did even better, earning the support of about 4 in 5\u00a0Democrats prioritizing that trait.", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ",

 "DEMOCRATIC VOTERS SKEW OLDER, TO CLINTON\u2019S ADVANTAGE ", " ",

  "Nearly 6\u00a0in 10\u00a0Democratic caucus-goers in Iowa were aged 50 or older, according to preliminary entrance poll data. Clinton led among those voters, earning the support of nearly 6 in 10\u00a0voters between 50 and 64 and nearly 7 in 10\u00a0from voters older than that. Sanders\u2019s support among younger voters was even larger, pulling in the vote of 8 in 10\u00a0voters under the age of 30. But only about a fifth of the electorate fell into that age range.", " ", " ", "

   [", "How the entrance polls look for the Republicans", "] 

  ", " ", " ", 

  "FIRST-TIME CAUCUS PARTICIPANTS", " ", 

  "First-time caucus-goers make up a somewhat smaller share of Democratic electorate than in 2008, according to preliminary entrance poll results. Just more than\u00a04 in 10 say they were\u00a0attending the caucuses for the first time, compared with 57 percent who were first-time caucus-goers eight years ago, when new voters were critical in propelling Barack Obama\u2019s surprise victory. A Quinnipiac University poll released on Monday found Bernie Sanders led Hillary Clinton with first-time caucus-goers by 17 points. Clinton led by 11 with those who had caucused before.", 

  " ", "These are preliminary results from a caucus poll of voters as they entered randomly selected caucus voting places in Iowa on Feb. 1, 2016. The Republican entrance poll results are based on 1,794\u00a0interviews, while Democrats are based on 1,660\u00a0interviews. The poll was conducted by Edison Media Research for National Election Pool, The Washington Post and other media organizations. The results for typical characteristics have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points.

By the end of last year, they had raised $73 million. In January, an additional $20 million poured in, almost all of it from contributions that averaged around $27.", " ", "That was enough for Sanders to put an additional 139 organizers in Iowa in January, more than doubling the total the campaign was saying publicly. As the political world focused throughout the summer on the gains Sanders was making against Clinton in New Hampshire, his campaign was building an Iowa operation earlier, and with more resources, than was generally recognized ", " ", "Weaver called it \u201cthe other campaign .\u2009.\u2009. the surprise campaign.\u201d", " ", "Sanders\u2019s first Iowa rally, which was in late May in Davenport, drew 700 people \u2014 the largest Iowa crowd any candidate had seen at that point. Volunteers were stationed there an hour and a half early to collect information about the attendees.", " ", "Typically at that early stage, voters are just starting to shop around for a candidate.

His message \u2014 this was something people were waiting to rally behind.\u201d", " ", "Although there was no doubt about the enthusiasm, marshalling it into 1,681 precinct caucuses presented a challenge. ", " ", "The campaign estimated that as many as 40 percent of the supporters it identified had never been to a caucus before. At meetings of his precinct captains, D\u2019Alessandro would ask which of them would be attending their first; sometimes, half the people in the room would raise their hands. And then there was the occasional volunteer who would tell him: \u201cYeah, I haven\u2019t done this since McGovern,\u201d referring to the Democrat who ran in 1972.", " ", "The campaign made an intense effort to train organizers and volunteers on how to canvass and phone-bank. Staffers sent out regular math exercises for them to do over the instant-messaging system Slack, to make sure they understood the calculations they would have to make under the arcane rules on caucus night. ", " ", "Sanders\u2019s operation tried to seize on opportunities presented by the unlikely sensation that the gruff 74-year-old senator was creating among young voters. Organizers got a list of 25,000 high school seniors to target, aware that anyone who would be 18 or older in November is eligible to caucus.", " ", "In the tiny hamlet of Underwood outside Cedar Rapids, the campaign signed up 35 12th graders \u2014 potentially enough to tip the balance on caucus night in a town of only 932 people.", " ", "All of it was a bet on turnout. By the day before the caucuses, the campaign\u2019s internal models showed that it would take 170,000 or more, second only to the record 240,00 that showed up in 2008, for Sanders to win.

What if everyone\u2019s right, and these people have just been coming to rallies?\u201d D\u2019Alessandro said as he headed into the final weekend. ", " ", "For most of the early months, Sanders continued to shun many of the trappings of a big-league political campaign. He did not hire a pollster or set up a voter modeling operation until October.", " ", "In retrospect, his campaign manager, Weaver, said, \u201cIf I had known the money would be there, I would have scaled up bigger earlier.\u201d", " ", "There were rough patches that showed how hard it was to go from running for office in a small, ethnically homogeneous state to a national campaign. Sanders seemed to be taken off balance when Black Lives Matter protesters began showing up at his events. And pundits wondered whether he had blundered at the first debate when the biggest controversy surrounding Clinton came up and he declared, \u201cThe American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails!\u201d", " ", "But the fact that whether he could beat Clinton in Iowa was even a question became an accomplishment in itself, given how far back Sanders had started.", " ", "And now, a party that expected a coronation is settling in for a marathon.

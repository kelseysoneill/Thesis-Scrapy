Rand Paul wasn\u2019t on the ballot Tuesday, but the Kentucky Republican got a much needed victory that might quell \u2014 for now \u2014 the calls for him to bow out of the 2016 presidential race and focus on winning another Senate term. ", "In a come-from-behind victory, Republican Matt Bevin won the Kentucky governor\u2019s race and Republicans nearly swept the other down-ballot races, including knocking off the incumbent state auditor who national Democrats had hoped would challenge Paul in next year\u2019s Senate race.", "The results demonstrated that the onetime border state\u2019s partisan lean continues to drift further to the right like its southern neighbors, giving Paul evidence to push back against critics who fear that his presidential ambition is putting his Senate seat at risk.", " \u201cWhat this election shows is that people who\u2019ve been promoting Democrats on the rise in Kentucky have been completely wrong,\u201d Paul said in an interview after Tuesday\u2019s resounding Republican win. \u201cNot only has President Obama destroyed the party in Kentucky, he\u2019s destroyed the bench. The bench that was supposed to rise up and run for office -- that\u2019s gone.\u201d", "Some GOP activists in Kentucky, joined by an increasingly vocal set of congressional Republicans, had questioned Paul\u2019s dual-track candidacy for the presidency and Senate re-election. His popularity at home has taken a hit and Democrats had been pushing state auditor Adam Edelen as the potential challenger.", "Instead, Edelen lost his race and Kentucky Democrats will hold just two statewide offices, including that of Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes, whose narrow win Tuesday came a year after her 2014 challenge to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) ended in a crushing defeat.", "\u201cRand Paul just got the greatest early Christmas present ever,\u201d said Todd Inman, a Republican activist from Owensboro, 100 miles west of Louisville.", "Democrats were left stunned by the losses after holding the governor\u2019s mansion 40 of the past 44 years. \u201cAnyone honest would have to say the Democratic Party\u2019s reeling right now,\u201d said Greg Stumbo, the Democratic speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives. Stumbo admitted that next year might be too soon to expect a recovery: \u201cCan we beat Rand Paul? I don\u2019t know.\u201d", " ", " ", "Paul said he plans to continue dismissing the gossip mill that has tried to at least nudge him into setting a deadline to consider withdrawing, so that his Senate seat can remain safely in the GOP column.", "\u201cYou wonder how the Washington narrative gets started,\u201d Paul said Tuesday night. \u201cWe\u2019ve always felt like I was in a strong position in Kentucky.\u201d", "Despite Tuesday\u2019s reprieve, the first-term senator with a libertarian bent must kick-start his presidential campaign or face another round of calls to withdraw simply because of his performance in the national campaign. Poor fundraising and uneven debate performances have provided little traction in critical early primary states and in national polling. ", "\u201cI\u2019ve been very disappointed in the campaign of Rand Paul. Something\u2019s missing. I don\u2019t know exactly what it is. I\u2019d endorsed him months ago. I quite frankly don\u2019t know now,\u201d Rep. Walter Jones (R-N.C.) said Tuesday, pushing for a deadline to turn around the campaign. \u201cIt seems that if they don\u2019t get off the ground in the next couple weeks, they need to make a decision. Rand has made some decisions that just did not energize the base.\u201d", "Some Kentucky activists say Paul might have already done enough damage to his standing at home that the Senate race will require substantial financial resources from national political parties and super PACs. \u201cIf he wasn\u2019t running for both, it would be a cakewalk. This might require an investment that otherwise wouldn't have been needed,\u201d said Scott Lasley, chairman of the Republican Party of Kentucky\u2019s 2nd Congressional District, based in Paul\u2019s hometown of Bowling Green.", "That was not supposed to be the case back in the spring, when operatives in both parties conceded Paul was too popular and McConnell\u2019s resounding victory there in 2014 showed the steep climb Democrats faced. Instead, both parties have focused on a handful of Senate races across the Midwest and in Florida, New Hampshire and Nevada.", "At stake is control of the Senate, setting its agenda and the ability to confirm \u2014 or reject \u2014 cabinet selections for the next president. ", "Needing at least a four-seat gain for the majority, Democrats had hoped to expand the map to include the Bluegrass State. ", "According to polling data tracked by Kentucky Democrats, Paul\u2019s favorability rating has taken a sharp hit: In April, 44 percent of voters had a favorable impression versus just 31 percent that held an unfavorable view of Paul. Now, those numbers have flipped, as 36 percent have a favorable view and 39 percent unfavorable. ", "There has been a troubling drop in die-hard fans of the iconoclastic senator. Paul started his presidential campaign with 20 percent of Kentucky voters expressing a \u201cvery favorable\u201d view of him, but now just 9 percent hold such a strong impression of him. ", " ", " ", "After Kentucky\u2019s elections, it\u2019s unclear who the Democrats can tap for the race. Washington Democrats had reached out to Edelen, 40, to consider challenging Paul. His narrow loss doesn\u2019t end his political career but it would be risky to run against Paul and have potentially back-to-back losses.", "Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer, 57, a former business executive, has been mentioned as a possible candidate. ", "By late January Paul will have to make a decision of some sort. That\u2019s when the filing deadline hits for the Senate election, and if he truly believes he has a chance to win the Republican nomination, he will need to get another Republican to also qualify for the ballot because state law would not allow Paul to be on the presidential and Senate ballots in the general election. ", "If it reaches that point, some GOP insiders view that as the fish-or-cut-bait moment, because not getting another Republican on the ballot would be an admission that Paul does not expect to win the presidential nomination. ", "Because of his presidential focus, Paul is doing minimal fundraising for his Senate race, collecting $156,000 last quarter and ending with $1.4 million in the bank \u2014 less money than he started the quarter with. ", "He\u2019s already shipped $1.4 million from his Senate campaign coffers to his presidential bid. Paul is legally forbidden from transferring money from a presidential bid to his Senate account, and national strategists are frankly more concerned that his White House bid will end up accruing debt that will require its own additional fundraising effort.", "Despite this seeming vulnerability, Kentucky Democrats \u2014 for now \u2014 are not sure they have anyone to run in the Senate race. ", "\u201cWe\u2019re a bit shell-shocked,\u201d Stumbo, the Democratic state House speaker, said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to regroup.\u201d"], "b_author1": ["David Weigel"], "b_author2": ["Paul Kane"]}

We need somebody there that knows what they\u2019re doing.\"", "That\u2019s a theme Bush tried to reinforce at the fair. He repeatedly cast himself as a competent executive, saying he fired under-performing bureaucrats as governor of Florida and would bring the same no-nonsense attitude to the federal government. He gave out his e-mail address (jeb@jeb.org) and encouraged fair goers to write to him with ideas.", "\"I got to be governor of a purple state, Florida,\" Bush said. \"It\u2019s not red like Texas, and it\u2019s not blue like California. It\u2019s right there in the middle, half a million more Democrats than Republicans. I was the most conservative governor in the state\u2019s history, but I had a reformer\u2019s heart.\"", "Bush made no mention in his remarks of Trump, the billionaire celebrity who plans a theatrical arrival at the fairgrounds Saturday by private helicopter.

He was the long-serving governor of a major\u00a0state that had led the nation in job creation and his rivals feared his potential. His southern roots and tea party appeal made him a candidate feared by his GOP rivals, particularly those in the campaign of Mitt Romney.", "Within weeks of announcing, he had risen to the top of the polls.

Perry accused his critics of not having a heart, but the damage was done.", "His worst moment came at a later debate in Michigan when he could not remember all of the federal agencies he had been vowing to eliminate as president. His final word as he admitted he couldn\u2019t recall the names was, \u201cOops.\u201d", "That became the caricature of Perry as a poorly prepared candidate. It was an image he was determined to erase as he looked toward the 2016 campaign. Perry was candid about the mistakes he made in that first campaign and in the intervening time immersed himself in the details of domestic and international policies.", "Perry said he believed voters were willing to give him a second chance. During the past two years, as he has traveled the country, he has earned positive reviews from one-time critics, who said they saw in him a more substantial and attractive candidate than in 2012.", "But he has lagged in the polls throughout this year, despite those better reviews and improved performance on the campaign trail. Failing to qualify for last week\u2019s debate in Cleveland was a clear setback in his hopes of moving up in the field.

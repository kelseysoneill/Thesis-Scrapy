That\u2019s when the filing deadline hits for the Senate election, and if he truly believes he has a chance to win the Republican nomination, he will need to get another Republican to also qualify for the ballot because state law would not allow Paul to be on the presidential and Senate ballots in the general election. ", "If it reaches that point, some GOP insiders view that as the fish-or-cut-bait moment, because not getting another Republican on the ballot would be an admission that Paul does not expect to win the presidential nomination.

There\u2019s a lot of good farmlands, good tourist area. Stability of law is one of the first things you need to have, and then you need to have the rule of contract.

Paul\u2019s plane, like all planes, had landed in Hugo Chavez International Airport, named in honor of the late dictator after his oil-rich country plugged $1 billion into Haiti. Paul\u2019s surgeries were taking place in a clinic with a plaque that thanks Venezuela for key aid.", "Paul was not impressed. \u201cThey\u2019re in the decline stage of socialism,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we are great at is buying selling, trading and making stuff. We should try to export that wherever. I do want to be engaged with places like Haiti in both charity and trade. But if you dump 10 million pounds of rice here, you\u2019d ruin the rice farmers. As I drive through the streets, what I think is: What would be the one business I could start in Haiti that would employ 10,000 people? There are ways to do that. The problem is that the government is not friendly to business.\u201d", "The SUV rolled on, past one of the many United Nations outposts built in Haiti since the earthquake. Paul had said he\u2019d be happy if the U.N. simply \u201cdissolved.\u201d In Haiti, he saw a role for blue helmets.", "\u201cI think that to have growth, you have to have stability,\u201d Paul said. \u201cThrough the last 100, 200 years, there\u2019s been a lot of times we\u2019ve been invited by one group and not really invited by the public. They still have memories of us being supportive of governments they weren\u2019t fond of. I\u2019m not sure it always has helped.

It seems there\u2019s an inability of providing that, then that\u2019s why the U.N. is here.\u201d", "Later, asked about the U.N.\u2019s role in bringing cholera to Haiti, Paul demurred.

Sorenson wanted the payments kept secret because of Iowa Senate ethics rules that prohibit sitting senators from accepting payments from a political campaign, according to court papers.

But Paul, who has argued that Iran could be contained just as Pakistan is contained, has never polled close to 28\u00a0percent. Even in the less-crowded fray of 2012, 28\u00a0percent would have been enough to win Iowa.", "The votes wouldn\u2019t necessarily transfer like that, Paul said. \u201cWhen you poll Iowa Republicans and you ask them: \u2018Do you think we should be more involved in foreign wars like John McCain, or less involved, like Rand Paul?\u2019 Using my name in the description, it\u2019s 45\u00a0percent for him, 41\u00a0percent for us,\u201d he said. \u201cYet we don\u2019t get 41\u00a0percent numbers.

Attendees of the six previous conferences bemoaned how low-key barbecues and open Q&As were replaced by something more anodyne, more professional \u2014 a marathon of speeches interrupted by occasional sweet tea and sandwiches.", "That did not soften the tone. The Gathering saw nine Republican candidates expand on the hard-right positions they had taken at their first debate last week. Former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee used his speech to deride paid transgender surgery for members of the military \u2014 an applause line \u2014 and to say that the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution could be used to define full legal personhood as starting at the moment of conception.", "In a news conference after the speech, Huckabee stopped short of explaining how this would work. \u201cYou\u2019re going to actually start protecting those people who are unborn,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not to criminalize people, certainly not mothers.

Before the conference began, Erickson had promised to ask candidates to commit to ending all funding for Planned Parenthood. Almost everyone was for it; Huckabee wanted to tie the funding quest to a debt limit vote instead. Bush said it was time to approve the Keystone XL pipeline, and that he was not sure how a reluctant State Department \u201cgot into the pipeline permitting business.\u201d And Cruz continued his war with Republican leaders, whom he has dubbed \u201cliars\u201d for not allowing votes to end the Export-Import Bank or Planned Parenthood\u2019s funding.", "\u201cThe truth is not rhetoric,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cHere\u2019s the truth.

The many well-financed efforts to rebrand the Republican Party were seeking out conservative activists who could spread their word on social media. The religious Alliance Defending Freedom piled on a table brochures on how to defend businesses from discrimination lawsuits lobbed by gay rights activists. Across the room, two young gay Republicans talked and distributed leaflets about how the Religious Freedom Restoration Act could backfire and defeat the party in 2016. A side room filled up for a discussion of why conservatives should back criminal-justice reform, and the main room was respectfully crowded for a speech about positivity by American Enterprise Institute President Arthur Brooks.", "All of this, said activists, could co-exist, even with Trump. Late Saturday, as they waited for buses to transport them to a tailgate at the College Football Hall of Fame, they were debating whether the business mogul should have been booted.

In April, for example, a Fox News poll asked Republican voters whether a nuclear Iran was a \u201cdisaster\u201d or a \u201cproblem that could be managed.\u201d Only 28\u00a0percent said it was manageable. But Paul, who has argued that Iran could be contained just as Pakistan is contained, has never polled close to 28\u00a0percent.

There are simply too many choices. The typical voter is far behind the media and some activists in making judgments. Polls capture name identification and the emotions of the moment, but they are hardly indicators of the future.", "Trump\u2019s blunt talk has brought him a surge of support. Others in the field still doubt he is a credible threat to win the nomination but fear his impact on the party.

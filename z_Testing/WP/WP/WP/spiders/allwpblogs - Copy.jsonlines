I don\u2019t buy it. Republicans should not overcommit to the notion that Trump, much less Carson, are serious candidates for the Republican nomination for 2016. I\u2019ll admit to being a little perplexed by the polls right now. When Trump entered the race, ", " somewhere in the low double digits, and I am sticking with the prediction that he will end up there. I think Trump is still riding high in the polls simply because Republican voters aren\u2019t even close to making a decision about who to vote for. And Trump has the highest name ID, has by far the most media coverage of any candidate and has tapped into a lot of anger on the right. That being said, I think Republican voters are going to revert to form by February.", "So to exactly what form are Republican voters going to revert? Well, just for fun, let\u2019s look at some of the Republicans who have actually won primaries and been elected to office in some of the key early states, and think about what similarities they might share with Trump. Last November, who did Iowans nominate to the U.S. Senate in a multi-candidate field? Joni Ernst, a farmer/veteran/state officeholder who was probably the star female candidate of 2014, who ran a great campaign appealing to core Republican values. In New Hampshire in 2010, Kelly Ayotte \u2014 who is a classic Republican stalwart \u2014 won the Republican primary and beat three other candidates (a Democrat, an independent and a Libertarian) in the general election to become senator and should be on any thinking person\u2019s list to be vice president. Nikki Haley, who was elected governor of South Carolina in 2010, may not have been the most conservative candidate in the field, but she put together a coalition of economic conservatives, suburbanites and other traditional Republican constituencies to beat all three of her Republican challengers. While Utah isn\u2019t an early primary state, what\u2019s happened in the party there is illustrative. In that state in 2010, Mike Lee, one of the tea party candidates, beat incumbent Sen. Bob Bennett in the Republican primary. Lee ran as a committed conservative who would not sell out and become a Washington \u201cRINO\u201d (Republican in Name Only). And if we look to one of the SEC primary states, Sen. Jeff Sessions (Ala.), a former Alabama attorney general and now perhaps the most conservative member of the Senate, is a perfect example of the kind of Republican Republicans nominate in my home state.", "Well, what do these candidates all have in common? They are all legitimate conservatives and ideologically committed, with well-established policy positions and strong Republican principles. None of them looks like or approaches politics in the same way as Donald Trump. Are Republicans suddenly gullible? In what universe does Donald Trump seem like any of these Republican leaders? He is a Manhattan billionaire who has no credible claim to any real Republican roots. His positions are all contrived for the day and they lack substance. He has a long history of contributing to Democratic candidates and causes. What does a RINO look like, if not that? Unless the Republican faithful have completely changed their stripes or a bunch of new voters are going to show up in the GOP primaries to elect someone like Donald Trump against a field of credentialed, serious candidates, I think it is very unlikely Trump will be our party\u2019s nominee. Republicans are going to nominate a Republican they can count on.", "Anyway, could Trump win some primaries with a plurality? That is, even with such a divided field, could he win with, say, 24 percent? Again, I think that is unlikely because of the Republican culture. The Republican front-runner may have to contend with an anti-establishment or far-right candidate, but, again, as recent history shows, at the end of the day Republicans consistently vote for good Republicans.", "Does Trump have the same appeal as Mitt Romney? John McCain? George W. Bush? Of course not. But has the Republican Party become something wildly different, or has Trump momentarily tapped into a lot of angry people on the right who are dissatisfied with Republican establishment leadership and a lot of resentment and feelings of being left out among what passes for the Republican center? Again, none of that means Republican voters will ultimately nominate Trump to be the carrier of the Republican banner in 2016.", "And while we are at it \u2014 and I know this post is getting a little long \u2014 I can\u2019t imagine that Carson will win a single primary either. So far, I have completely missed what might be a plausible reason to elect Carson to be the next president of the United States. He seems like a good man and a distinguished fellow, but his appeal doesn\u2019t satisfy Republican yearnings. Bush, Kasich and Rubio all have strong enough campaign infrastructures in place to launch respectable campaigns in January. Watch for those three to begin to outmaneuver Trump and others in the next few months. There is lots of talk about the establishment panicking, but it is way too early to panic.

Going forward it is quite possible that the race comes down to Trump or Carson (both need Iowa); Kasich or Christie (both need New Hampshire) plus Bush, Rubio, Cruz and Fiorina. And certainly, it could boil down to far fewer candidates if Carson, Trump, Kasich and Christie don\u2019t win anything. We can, in other words, go from 14 to a handful by mid-February.

It was such a good deal for Iran it could not say no. Cardin\u2019s\u00a0action brought rare praise from a conservative group.

But the problem, which informed critics of the deal including Cardin have been making, is that it is vital for American security and Israel\u2019s existence to end the policy of appeasement and chart a new course. That is not possible with the Iran deal, the pinnacle of appeasement. \u201cAll I would ask of the Republican candidates is they live up to the example that Senator Cardin has set,\u201d Brog says. \u201cTalking about tough enforcement of this deal misses the point. \u00a0This deal \u2014 even if diligently enforced \u2014 still legitimizes Iran\u2019s nuclear activities. \u00a0This deal \u2014 even if followed to the letter \u2014 still provides Iran with quick billions that it\u2019s already spending to send missiles into Israel. \u00a0This deal is a disaster. \u00a0Let\u2019s leave talk of disaster mitigation for after the Congressional debate.\u201d", "Trump and Kasich may toughen or completely reverse their language, but plainly they do not understand the fundamental problem with the deal.

The result is debased political discourse and a sense of victimhood bent on attacking Republicans who dare to govern responsibly. Voters surely shoulder their share of blame. They run to embrace bad causes, gobble up a steady diet of political junk food, \u00a0celebrate rotten behavior and buy into the notion that insufficient conservative extremism is the root of our troubles. If President Obama has done more than Republicans could have hoped to do on their own to unify the GOP and re-instill proper concern for national security, then the right wing has done more to undermine conservatism than any Democrat could have done.

And no candidate has a right to expect voters\u2019 support. But it is fair to worry whether the GOP electorate has become incapable of setting standards for political debate, of distinguishing \u00a0crass entertainers from legitimate contenders and of rejecting bigotry and irresponsibility. If so, Republicans picked a particularly inopportune moment to lose their marbles. On the other side are hopelessly partisan Democrats who are indifferent to the world\u2019s suffering, allergic to world leadership and wedded to an utterly unsustainable welfare state that is creating more poor people, more non-workers and more divisiveness that we have seen in decades. The country needs a serious, responsible Republican Party. I am increasingly worried it is on the brink of extinction."], "b_author2": []}

He retells this story frequently \u2014 if not in\u00a0every speech and interview \u2014 on the campaign trail.

There are many different origin stories for Occupy. It is true that the Madison protests preceded Occupy. And there were other protests, too, that preceded Occupy. For example, \u2018Bloombergville\u2019 in NYC. Early 2011 was a period of sustained global unrest,\u201d White said. \u201cHowever, if you\u2019re asking whether the idea for Occupy Wall Street emerged out of the Madison protests, the answer is no.\u201d", "Act 10 protests did precede Occupy Wall Street and the larger Occupy Movement that spun off from the Zuccotti Park protests. The origin of a grass-roots movement is subject to interpretation to a certain extent. One could argue there are parallels to Act 10 protesters\u2019 frustration over cuts to public workers\u2019 rights and benefits, and the Occupy Movement\u2019s message of income and economic inequality. There were some union groups involved in Occupy Wall Street, though unions did not play as big of a role as they did in Act 10 protests.", "Act 10 protests clearly defined a lot of Walker\u2019s political history. The issue here is that Walker does not merely say that protests over his budget bill preceded Occupy Wall Street. He actually says that the budget fight \u201cgave birth to\u201d the Occupy Movement. That\u2019s giving himself far too much credit. Any claim that the Act 10 protests galvanized an international movement is simply false.", "\u00a0", "(", ")", "\u00a0"], "b_author2": []}

Walsh has had a 45-year-long career as a classroom teacher, reading specialist and curriculum director in schools in New Jersey and Pennsylvania.

I don\u2019t think even a Republican candidate for president could get away with punching a woman in the face. Belittling them, yes. Berating them, yes. Taking away the choice of what they do with their bodies, yes. But not striking a woman, especially with a Hillary running on the Democratic side.", "So, taking all this into consideration, I would like to step up and offer Christie my face to punch.", "I am well qualified for the job. I have been a public school teacher and administrator for 45 years. I have been the president and the chief negotiator of my local teachers union. I have been sharply critical of Christie\u2019s education policies on my blog. I deserve that punch in the face. I have earned it. Not only that, I live just a stone\u2019s throw from the State House in Trenton, so I could meet the governor there at any time, if he ever happens to get back to New Jersey.", "I am sure it would give Christie a boost in the polls and solidify his standing as a violent, bullying looney worthy of Republican voter support. It might even be enough to get him on the stage at one of the primary debates, where he could punch Wolf Blitzer in the face and garner even more support.", "Better yet, forget the debate and let Trump and Christie duke it out in a steel-cage wrestling match.", "No doubt Christie\u2019s spin doctors will be out today declaring that he has no animus toward teachers, just teachers unions. Christie, Scott Walker, Jeb Bush, Andrew Cuomo and others seem to forget that a teachers union is made up of teachers and that while individual teachers may not agree with every action of their unions, those unions represent the desires and aspirations of millions of hard-working teachers across the country \u2014 imperfectly perhaps, but emphatically for the better of teachers and children and public education overall.", "When teacher unions fight for better working conditions for teachers, they are also working for better learning conditions for children. When unions fight for job protections for teachers, they are also working to ensure that children have access to the best knowledge and the best instructional strategies available, unfettered by flavor-of-the-day ideology. When teacher unions fight for reasonable pay, they are fighting to attract high-quality candidates to the profession.", "What has Christie\u2019s teacher-bashing and vitriol against unions, his stripping of job protections, his attacks on pensions done for the children of New Jersey? How have his repeated attacks on teacher unions improved education for the children of New Jersey? How has his hiring of political hacks to bring unpopular education policies to the impoverished cities of New Jersey helped schoolchildren?", "The answer is, of course, not at all. The children of New Jersey are worse off educationally than they were when Christie took office. And yet, those teachers he loves to hate keep soldiering on, doing their best in the face of intolerable and deteriorating conditions to provide a good education for New Jersey\u2019s children.", "If Christie wants to punch the teachers unions in the face, he needs to realize that he is punching every teacher in the face. He is punching each and every dedicated teacher who has been working to improve the lives of children for decades before Christie discovered that bashing teachers is a winning campaign strategy.", "So, Governor Christie, here is my face. Take your best shot. I won\u2019t hit back. I will just pick myself up, dust myself off and go back to being the best teacher I can be.

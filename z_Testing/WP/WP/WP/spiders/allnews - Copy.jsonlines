He explained the difference between communism, socialism, capitalism and democratic socialism -- in very professorial terms.", " \u2014 or really the concept of \"liberalism\" \u2014 arose in the 17th century, and centers on the right to private property. In Adam Smith's foundational \"Wealth of Nations,\" Quill notes, \"is recognition that capitalism is going to make the lives of a good majority of the population miserable, and that there will be a need for government intervention in society and the economy to offset the worse effects.\"", " was in part a response to capitalism, largely through the writings of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. Socialism focuses on the inequalities that arise within capitalism through a number of possible responses. Quill outlined some possibilities: \"[T]he state might 'wither away' or collapse altogether, in others it would regulate the production of goods and services, in yet others it would become thoroughly democratic\" -- all with the aim of reducing that inequality.", "You can see that's where ", " arises. That philosophy, Quill writes, seeks \"democratic control of sectors of society and economy in order to avoid the pitfalls of an unregulated market and -- this is most important -- the kind of terrible authoritarian government that emerged in the Soviet Union.\"", " \"was the endpoint of Marx's ideas,\" Quill writes, though Marx didn't delineate what it would look like, exactly. \"We find hints in works like 'The German Ideology\" (1846) where there is a description of working life that is unalienated, i.e. creative and various -- we hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, and become opera critics in the evening.\" During the Cold War, though, the idea came to be inextricably and pejoratively associated with the Soviet Union and with the elimination of private property. The term, in Quill's words, \"served as a shorthand for all things un-American\" -- which was the way that Trump used it.", "Quill's most important point is that \"all of these terms are 'umbrella concepts'; in other words, they are host to a family of related ideas, not all of them compatible with one another.\" We tend to use the terms concretely, which necessarily introduces inaccuracies. Or, as Quill put it, \"they [can] serve as excuses not to think, as belief systems that discourage explorations of the mismatch between theory and practice and the inconsistencies of any grand theory.\"", "So that's the college-level curriculum. Next, I scaled it back a bit and talked to Tori Waite, who teaches high school history at Del Mar High School in San Jose. After all, since most of us were first introduced to these ideas in high school, perhaps\u00a0we just need a refresher.", "\"When we teach about the different types of economies,\" Waite said, \"the first thing we do is we talk about economic questions. How is it made? Who makes it? Who gets to buy it? Based on the economy, different people answer those questions.\"", "Simplifying Quill's explanation: \"In a ", " country, the government answers those questions. There's no private business. There's no private property. The government decides.\"", "\"In a ", " society, the people make those decisions. The businesses, the market decides how much products will cost, how many there are, where it will be made.\"", "\"In the ", " system, there's a mix of both. The government operates the system to help all, but there is opportunity for private property and private wealth. That's generally how we talk about it.\" Back to Quill's point: A socialist government could control all of the means of production -- or it could, for example, use taxes to redistribute resources among the population.", "Both Quill and Waite note that the United States is not a purely capitalist society. There are and have long been socialist aspects to how the government makes decisions and applies its power, while still striving to keep the marketplace as free as possible. And, of course, while allowing democratic decisions to guide what it does.", "The example of the United States serves as a reminder that these ideas exist on a three-dimensional scale, in which differentiation is often tricky. Which brings us to our quiz, in which you will be asked to concretely differentiate between systems. Given the example at hand, can you identify which economic system we're talking about?", "(Waite generously provided both the feedback and overall grades that you will receive for doing so.

The same could be happening in the United States right now regarding the presidential campaign and, in particular, the candidacy of Donald J. Trump.", "One problem is that the media often places far too much emphasis on polls taken weeks (or in the United States, months) in advance of an election. In reality, voters do change their minds at the last minute. Many people are not as interested in politics as commentators who write or talk about politics for a living. People with less interest in politics are also less likely than others to agree to participate in election polls and, if they do participate, they are less likely to state opinions about who they prefer.", "But, like students who are not that interested in school, they may decide to \u201cstudy\u201d at the last minute and then vote. This appears to have been the case in Canada. Throughout the campaign, two of us (Loewen and Rubenson) polled a random sample of Canadians every day. These data suggest many voters remained undecided through the campaign. At the outset, 27 percent of likely voters were undecided. Nearly one-fifth, 18 percent, said they were undecided the day before the election.", "Here is a second problem: the media often fail to appreciate \u201cstrategic voting.\u201d In both Canada and Britain, four parties with significant funding and campaign organizations contested the election. Yet in each parliamentary district, only the top candidate is awarded a seat in parliament.", "Now consider the situation of a voter who comes to realize that their favorite party will not win the seat in their district.

In a tight election, this type of realization and decision is most likely to come in a campaign\u2019s final days.", "Again, this appeared to be the case in Canada. In many parts of the country, Canadians who initially leaned toward one left-of-center party (the NDP) appeared to switch their vote to the other left-of-center party (the Liberals) as it became clear that only one left-of-center party had a real chance of defeating Stephen Harper and the Conservatives.", "Another factor that can lead pre-election polls to miss the actual result is how votes are allocated across electoral districts. Many organizations report on national poll numbers, but these don\u2019t always provide an accurate sense of what will happen in individual districts.", "In both Britain and Canada, the leading party earned over 50 percent of the seats despite getting less than 40 percent of the nationwide vote.

He is boycotting Fox News, having threatened to file a complaint with federal regulators against one of the channel's commentators.", "Trump has said he doesn't understand why reporters have focused on dips in his poll numbers rather than highlighting that he continues to dominate \"every poll nationwide \u2026 and every state.\" He doesn't understand why photographers snapped images of rows of empty chairs at his speech at a business convention in South Carolina on Wednesday afternoon, especially when a town hall that evening was packed. He doesn't understand why some of his opponents are criticizing him for not providing specific answers to foreign policy questions, since he doesn't think a potential president should share such information.", "Trump's frustration seems to boil down to this: He doesn't understand why everyone isn't cheering him on like this massive crowd at the state fair.", "\"No matter where I go, we have these incredible crowds,\" Trump said Friday night. \"Something is happening that is amazing. It's amazing.\"", "Trump looked out Friday night at thousands of Oklahomans, many in Trump T-shirts and caps, waving Trump signs and screaming his name.

Before Trump appeared, a live bald eagle named Uncle Sam sat regally on the stage and entertained the crowd with its long wistful looks and occasional resettling of feathers. There was a young woman who belted out pop covers from Adele and Rachel Platten. And a fiddler. And a local politician who declared: \"Pick up your pitchfork! Follow our next commander-in-chief!

Tracy Pratcher, 55, drove more than two and a half hours from western Oklahoma with her son because she wanted to hear Trump's pitch.

Maybe America needs that right now, she said.", "\"I want to hear what he has to say,\" said Pratcher, who was holding a stuffed plush bald eagle. \"I want to hear more than 'Let's make America great again' and we'll be good. I want to hear some issues.\"", "She didn't get to hear anything new, as Trump mostly kept to his usual talking points: He bemoaned the loss of jobs and business to China. He criticized the Republican establishment and its chosen candidates. He slammed Republican rival Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) for missing votes in Washington, lacking personal wealth and just generally being a \"lightweight.\" He mocked Secretary of State John Kerry for getting hurt in a bicycle accident and said: \"I promise you, as president, I will never be in a bicycle race.\" He yet again promised to construct a massive wall along the southern border, \"the kind that if they ever do get to the top, you don't get down.\" And he defended his use of the phrase \"anchor baby.\"", "[", "]", "Again and again, Trump slammed the media and its \"moron pundits.\" He said CNN should be grateful he attracted millions of viewers and higher-paying advertisers to the latest Republican debate: \"All because of me.

I don't want people to know what my plan is, I have plans. I have plans.\"", "Those plans will be great, Trump promised. He opened and closed the 50-minute-long speech by promising Oklahomans \"so many victories.\" Even if some of Trump's promises lacked feasibility or sounded a bit too good to be true, the crowd cheered him on. \"We love you, Trump!\" one man near the stage shouted again and again. Another man picked the mantra of: \"You're going to win!\" A woman just screamed over and over: \"Truuuuuump! Truuuuump!\"", "\"We are going to do so many things,\" Trump said\u00a0in closing. \"We are going to have so many victories.

What happened?", "I started covering Walker in late April when he was an early favorite in Iowa, poll numbers were high and donations were rolling in. Since then, I have interviewed countless Walker supporters as I traveled thousands of miles with him \u2014\u00a0following the \"Walker Winnebago\" down gravel roads in rural Iowa and watching\u00a0his rented\u00a0Harley-Davidson Road King hug\u00a0bends in New Hampshire's mountains. I discovered Wisconsin cheese curds (best when fried and dipped in ranch dressing) and got to know a\u00a0mild-mannered Midwestern presidential candidate who seemed enamored with retail politics, campaign strategy, social media and whatever his two college-aged sons deemed interesting. I\u00a0watched as Walker's\u00a0campaign quickly devolved, poll numbers fell, staff members grew frustrated and donors lost hope.", "[", "]", "My colleagues and I are still unraveling exactly what went wrong, but here are nine things I learned about Walker on the trail that help explain how he ran his campaign \u2014\u00a0and why he decided to end it:", " Walker has only been the governor of Wisconsin for 4\u00bd years, following more than eight years as the Milwaukee County executive. Yet unlike many young governors, he had a strong national profile \u2014\u00a0along with the admiration of many wealthy Republican donors \u2014\u00a0because of the dramatic, highly publicized battle he waged against his state's public-sector unions in 2011, soon after becoming governor. In severely weakening those unions and then winning a recall election, Walker earned the support of fiscal conservatives and the tea party, and angered liberals around\u00a0the country.", "So with a seemingly wide-open presidential primary, it made sense for Walker to run, pitching himself as a Republican loathed by Democrats who has had success in beating them. But Walker often seemed to struggle to explain exactly why he would be a better president than the other Republicans running. He seemed to write much of his domestic and foreign policy as he went along, rather than coming to the race with a clear vision of where he would take the country. For many voters who are often tired of uncompromising career politicians and gridlock in Washington, perhaps Walker's promise to fight Democrats just wasn't enough.", "[", "]", " For a candidate who has been campaigning since he was 22, Walker seems to lack a defined coterie of trusted political confidants \u2014\u00a0or even longtime best friends from outside the political world whose advice he trusts. Walker has long been rather independent, serving as his own political strategist and trusting his own instincts above all else, sometimes frustrating his staff by making decisions without their counsel.", "As Walker launched his presidential bid, advisers who had been key to his breakout success in Wisconsin were suddenly sidelined or isolated at a super PAC, which is legally barred from coordinating with the campaign. Walker hired a team of campaign staffers from outside the state who moved to Madison and rushed to get to know him. Walker has long said that his wife, Tonette Walker, is his closest confidant, along with their two college-aged sons, Matt and Alex. Walker nearly always says \"we\" instead of \"I\" when discussing how he decided to run for president. In the end, Walker said his decision to suspend the campaign was one he discussed with his wife and God.", "[", "]", " In late July, Walker held a town hall at a family-style restaurant in Red Oak, a town with fewer than 6,000 residents in western Iowa. An advance team with a moving van of equipment arrived hours early to hang up flags, set up a sound system and arrange a stage with tiered seating to provide a backdrop of Iowans. Walker arrived with a large entourage: his security detail, campaign manager, personal aide, full-time campaign photographer, two Iowa-based staffers and a horde of low-level employees who handed out brochures. As he spoke for roughly an hour, one man on the stage had to shield his eyes from a bright spotlight.", "That's the level of staging that Walker enjoyed during nearly every campaign stop during his first month on the trail \u2014\u00a0which worried some supporters, who considered the elaborate set-ups a waste of money so early in the campaign. These glitzy events seemed more suited to a candidate who had already locked down the nomination, but they matched Walker's forceful confidence \u2014\u00a0he truly considered himself a front-runner who could win over most voters in most states.", " Unlike many candidates for president, Walker lacks personal wealth. As a young state lawmaker, he made less than $40,000 per year. When he became the Milwaukee County executive in 2002, he kept a campaign promise to return much of his salary, a total that he says reached $375,000 by 2010. As governor, Walker was paid nearly $148,000 per year, in addition to free housing in the governor's mansion, taxpayer-provided vehicles and other perks. He also received a $45,000 advance for the 2013 book he wrote about his fight with the unions.", "But financial disclosures revealed that Walker has tens of thousands of dollars in credit card debt, including a large balance on a card with an interest rate of more than 27 percent. His two sons have taken on at least $100,000 in student loan debt and have yet to graduate from college. It's clear that unlike some candidates in the race, Walker could not afford to absorb any potential debt of a presidential campaign. Several donors said Monday night that fear of debt was a driving factor in Walker's decision to so suddenly step out of the race.", "[", "]", " Early in the campaign, Walker and his backers would brag about his ability to relentlessly stay on message: He again and again repeated the same campaign speech. He gave reporters the same answers to questions about issues of the day. He memorized his announcement speech and recited it. This often left him sounding robotic and not fully answering the questions he was asked.", "But when reporters and cable news show hosts pushed for specifics, Walker would often slip up, making comments that didn't quite make sense or taking stances he didn't mean to take \u2014\u00a0but then hesitating to take a different position or admit that he had misspoken, perhaps for fear of cementing an image of being a flip-flopper. Instead, he appeared to lack clear stances on a number of issues, including birthright citizenship and the U.S. response to the Syrian refugee crisis. Several supporters exploded with frustration when Walker called building a wall along the Canadian border a \"legitimate\" idea \u2014\u00a0and then waited more than a day to make clear that he did not actually want to construct a wall along the 5,252-mile northern border.", "[", "]", " Ahead of the first Republican debate, I watched hours of video footage from Walker's previous debates in Wisconsin. In a few of these, Walker had the opportunity to ask his opponent a question and passed. Instead, he stuck to his talking points and avoided confrontation.", "This is a candidate who built his presidential campaign on the premise that he was a fighter \u2014\u00a0yet he seemed uncomfortable confronting people face to face, especially fellow Republicans. On the early campaign trail, Walker ignored protesters, maneuvered out of conversations that turned testy, rarely held town halls and avoided follow-up questions from reporters whenever possible.", "In recent weeks, Walker tried to shift course. He became more aggressive by yelling back at a protester at the Iowa State Fair, criticizing fellow Republicans, challenging Trump at the latest debate, scheduling more town halls and swearing that he would \"wreak havoc on Washington.\" But all those actions sometimes felt forced and out of character.", " In June, I followed Walker to Quebec City, where he attended a conference for Canadian and U.S. officials from the Great Lakes region. When he addressed the audience, Walker marveled at the pitchers of water sitting on the conference tables in the palatial hotel and said he drank from them without hesitation: \"There are plenty of places around the world I go to that I would not dare do that. I would not be drinking water unless they brought it to me in a bottle, and I could make sure the top had not been turned \u2026 because I wouldn't know if I would get sick or not.\"", "The list of countries Walker has visited is not lengthy or exotic \u2014\u00a0and most trips came this year as he rushed to learn more about foreign policy so he could speak with the same ease as many of his well-traveled rivals. While Walker's knowledge deepened this year, he still struggled to project that authority. On a majority of foreign policy questions, he would pivot to two major talking points: the need to destroy \"radical Islamic terrorism\" and to embrace Israel as an ally.", "[", "]", " Days after launching his campaign, Walker pulled an all-nighter when his flight was diverted because of weather. During campaign stops in South Carolina the next day, Walker was visibly exhausted, his eyes red and puffy. He started slurring words, turning \"Harley\" into \"Farley\" and \"ISIS\" into \"aces.\" Although the crowd laughed and clapped as he recounted his harrowing travel adventures, they didn't get to see his best self. The same was true as Walker rode a rented Road King through New Hampshire over Labor Day weekend, becoming frustrated and mixing up his words as he addressed a swarm of reporters at the end of the first day of the ride. If Walker stayed in the race, the grueling schedule likely would have continued.", " When Walker was in the state assembly, the Democrat serving as the Milwaukee County executive resigned amid scandal over changes to the pension system. Walker jumped into that race and won. In 2006, he tried running for governor but dropped out when it became clear that he didn't have the fundraising power of other candidates. He came back in 2010 and won.", "Walker has had a knack for studying the political currents, jumping at opportunities; knowing when to join a fight \u2014\u00a0and knowing when to leave one."], "b_author2": []}

The GOP's leaders have themselves said plainly and openly that the changing composition of the American population and its electorate make earning a larger share of the Latino vote an utter political imperative for Republican candidates and the party. In every election since the 1960s, Latinos have voted overwhelmingly for Democrats. And in the last two presidential elections, Republicans have not managed to garner even one-third of their votes.", "Now, if Kasich's staff is to be believed and Kasich's hotel maid story was one aimed at public honor and respect, if this was Kasich's attempt at minority voter outreach or at least a reminder to the GOP's overwhelmingly white base that Latinos do, indeed have value, the GOP's work in this area looks very likely to be quite long and steep.", "In fairness, what Kasich said is born of some statistical realities.

Kasich and many other Americans don't run across Latino golf club owners, lawyers, doctors, artists and astronauts in their daily lives. And, as such, they apparently have no sense of the range of interests, habits and skills that exist in any other population can also be found among Hispanic Americans. If they did, they might recognize just how problematic Kasich's comments really are and just how hard it's going to be to explain them away.", "Kasich and the GOP might\u00a0want more Latino votes. But wanting and getting are two very different things. The work of actually earning some larger share really shouldn't be a massive and inscrutable mystery; it is probably going to require some internal work long before campaigns begin and some effort to understand Latinos as a large and important population -- but also real, living, breathing and thinking individuals with actual political and policy interests.", "Now, on the scale of the many enduring stereotypes that one can embrace and then try to defend, Kasich's comments sit\u00a0somewhere closer to congratulating a black person for saying something \"articulate\" than gripping one's purse when a young man of color boards the elevator.", "It's less 'these people are a problem' and more an expression of both insulting and limiting surprise. 'Oh, wow, this one is good.' 'This one is clean.' 'This one is hard-working or has an agile brain.' 'This one is grateful to have a\u00a0job.'", "But if your notion of the value and merit of 17 percent of the U.S. population is constrained to what they can clean, cut, trim, or service ", " and your idea of stumping for their votes consists of praising the \"willing\" nature of their work, know this. You have a problematic and condescending view of Latinos that did not likely begin when you started telling your story about high-quality and \"willing\" service to an\u00a0Orange County audience at a golf club. And, that's the most generous thing that can be said.", "I can't speak for that maid at the center of Kasich's story. Really no one but she can.

That work might\u00a0be the work she has found and was never part of any consciously made plan, much less dream.

Simply allowing more into our country doesn't solve this problem.", "The way to solve this problem is for us to be clear to our friends and allies that we're going to replace Assad, we're going to hunt down and destroy ISIS; our friends don't trust us, our enemies don't fear and respect us.", "But I want to go back on immigration. Let me be very clear. Immigration, we need to insist on assimilation in immigration. My parents came here legally almost 45 years ago. They came here, they followed the rule of law.

A 14-year-old Muslim high school student in Texas was arrested on Monday for bringing a homemade clock to school after it was mistaken for a fake bomb. Police released the young man after they determined it was, in fact, a clock. Today, President Obama invited that student to the White House.", "Governor Jindal, throughout your campaign, you've spoken many times about Muslim extremists in this country. How would you, as president, strike a balance between vigilance and discrimination?", "JINDAL: Well, Jake, look, I think the American people -- we don't discriminate anybody based on the color of their skin or their creed. I think the way you strike that balance, you say to Muslim leaders, they have got two responsibilities.", "One, it's not enough to denounce just simply generic acts of violence. They have got to denounce the individuals by name, and say these are not martyrs. These terrorists are not martyrs; rather, they are going straight to hell. They are not going to enjoy a reward in their afterlife.", "Secondly, they have to explicitly embrace the same freedoms for everybody else they want for themselves. Look, I know it's politically incorrect to say this, the president says Fort Hood was an issue of workplace violence.", "We are at war with radical Islam. Our president loves to apologize for America, he goes to the National Prayer Breakfast, brings up the Crusades, criticizes Christians. We're at war today with radical Islamic extremists.", "It's not politically correct to say that, but the way you strike that balance, you say to Muslim leaders, denounce these fools, these radical terrorists by name, say they are not martyrs.", "TAPPER: Governor Jindal, I'm afraid you didn't answer the question. How do you strike the balance between vigilance and discrimination?", "Obviously, we know how you feel about the vigilance part of this. Do you ever see the discrimination part of it?", "JINDAL: Sure, I don't think a 14-year-old should ever get arrested for bringing a clock to school. So, if you're asking me I'm glad he wasn't -- he was released. I'm glad that police are careful. I'm glad they are worried about security and safety issues.", "Look, in America we don't tolerate them. The biggest discrimination is going on against Christian business owners and individuals who believe in traditional forms of marriage. They are throwing this woman in jail in Kentucky.", "(APPLAUSE)", "Let's talk about that. Let's talk about the Christian florist, the caterer, the musician, who simply want to say, don't arrest us for having -- or don't discriminate against us, don't shut down our businesses, don't fine us thousands of dollars for believing marriage is between a man and a woman. Lets talk about not discriminating against Christians.", "TAPPER: Thank you, Governor. We will get to that subject later in the debate.", "Senator Graham?", "GRAHAM: Well, you know, Kim Davis, I'm not worried about her attacking me. I am worried about radical Islamic terrorists who are already here planning another 9/11.", "We're at war, folks. I'm not fighting a crime.

Yes, Kim Davis is different from Islamist radicalists from the Middle East.", "But on the other hand, we have run rule in America, an elected official can't say I'm not going to follow that law if it conflicts with my beliefs. I think she should have been fired and if she worked for me, I would have fired her. We have to uphold the rule of law.", "(APPLAUSE)", "TAPPER: Thank you, Governor.", "PATAKI: Imagine one minute -- Jake, imagine one minute that was a Muslim who said I don't believe in gay marriage, and refused to perform that wedding. We wouldn't have had that outrage. There's a place where religion supersedes the rule of law. It's called Iran. It shouldn't be the United States.", "TAPPER: We'll get to that subject in the next block. We're going to take a very quick break.

We saw her as a hero.", "Today, someone who refuses to defy (sic) a judge's unconstitutional verdict is ridiculed and criticized, chastised because she's standing up and denying -- not denying her God and her faith.", "That is a huge difference in 16 years. People have a fundamental right in the First Amendment. There's no more important right. It is the right that is the trunk that all other rights come from, and that's the freedom of conscience.", "And when we say in America that we have no room -- how many bakers, how many florists, how many pastors, how many clerks are we going to throw in jail because they stand up and say, \"I cannot violate what my faith says is against its teachings\"? Is there not room in America? I believe there has to be room.", "First, I believe we have to pass the First Amendment Defense Act, which provides that room for government officials and others who do not want to be complicit in what they believe is against their faith.", "Second, we need as a president who's going to fight a court that is abusive, that has superseded their authority. Judicial supremacy is not in the Constitution, and we need a president and a Congress to stand up to a court when it exceeds its constitutional authority.", "(APPLAUSE)", "TAPPER: Thank you, Senator.", "Governor Pataki, your response?", "PATAKI: My response is kind of, \"Wow.\" You know, we're going to have a president who defies the Supreme Court because they don't agree?", "SANTORUM: I hope so. If they're wrong.", "PATAKI: Then you don't have the rule of law...", "SANTORUM: No, what you have is judicial supremacy. You don't have a rule of law when the court has the final say on everything.", "PATAKI: The -- the elected representatives of the people always have the opportunity to change that law. The Supreme Court makes a determination, but it's ultimately the elected officials who decide whether or not that would be accepted.", "By the way, if I have a chance to lead this country, I will appoint judges who understand their role. They're not going to be making the law; they're going to be interpreting law that the elected officials passed.", "PATAKI: But there's a huge difference between an individual standing up and saying I am going to stand for my religious freedom and my religious rights. I applaud that. This is America. You should be able to engage in your religious belief in the way you see fit.", "But when you are an elected official and you take an oath of office to uphold the law, all the laws, you cannot pick and choose or you no longer have a society that depends on the rule of law.", "(APPLAUSE)", "TAPPER: Thank you, Senator Santorum?", "SANTORUM: Martin Luther King wrote a letter from the Birmingham jail. And he said in that letter that there are just laws and there are unjust laws. And we have no obligation to -- to condone and accept unjust laws.", "And he -- and they -- then he followed up and said what's an unjust law?", "An unjust law is a job that -- a law that go against the moral code or God's law or the natural law.", "I would argue that what the Supreme Court did is against the natural law, it's against God's law and we have every obligation to stand in opposition to it.", "UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Jake...", "PATAKI: Yes, I -- I didn't agree with the Supreme Court's decision, but it is the law of this land. And I am a great admirer of Martin Luther King. And he was prepared to break the law. But it wasn't in an office of political power. It was civil disobedience, where what he was willing to do is voluntarily go to jail with his followers to send a message to the elected representatives that these laws were wrong and had to be changed.", "And because of his courage, we didn't ignore the courts, we changed the laws and made America a better place. That's the way to do it.", "TAPPER: Thank you, Governor.", "JINDAL: Jake -- Jake... (CROSSTALK)", "TAPPER: We're coming to both of you.", "JINDAL: Jake, I've got a practical question.", "TAPPER: What...", "(CROSSTALK)", "JINDAL: I've got a practical question. I'd like the left to give us a list of jobs that Christians aren't allowed to have. If we're not allowed to be clerks, bakers, musicians, caterers, are we allowed to be pastors (INAUDIBLE)?", "TAPPER: Governor Jindal...", "JINDAL: We're not allowed to be elected officials. I firmly -- this is an important point. The First Amendment rights, the right to religious freedom is in the First Amendment of \"The Constitution.\" It isn't breaking the law to exercise our constitutional rights. America did not create religious liberty, religious liberty created the United States of America. It is the reason we're here today.", "(APPLAUSE)", "UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I...", "TAPPER: Senator Graham, do you want to weigh in?", "GRAHAM: I wasn't the best law student. By the end of this debate, it would be the most time I've ever spent in any library.", "(LAUGHTER)", "GRAHAM: But on the first day in law school view (ph), it's called \"Marbury v. Madison.\" The group in our constitutional democracy that interprets \"The Constitution\" as to what it means is the Supreme Court. In a 5-4 decision by the Supreme Court, they have ruled that same-sex marriage bans at the state level violate the Fourteenth Amendment to \"The United States Constitution\" equal protection clause.", "I don't agree with it, but that is the law of the land. But as president, what I want make sure of is that everybody in this room, Christian, Jewish, Muslim, whatever religion that you can practice your faith without government interference, you can marry people consistent with the tenets of your faith. That's the number one obligation of my presidency, is to protect religious people when they exercise their religious rights.", "But this decision is the law as it is of right now.", "And here's the one thing I want to tell you, Jake.", "TAPPER: Thank you, Senator.", "GRAHAM: Wait -- wait a minute.", "Whether you're the wedding cake baker or the gay couple or the Baptist preacher, radical Islam would kill you all if they could.", "TAPPER: Senator...", "GRAHAM: Let's don't lose sight of the big picture here.", "TAPPER: Thank you, Senator.", "I want to stay with the subject of Supreme Court judges -- justices.", "Governor Jindal, both Senators graham and Santorum voted to confirm chief justice of the United States, John Roberts, who has led with the majority twice to uphold ObamaCare.", "Do you think that Graham's and Santorum's votes to confirm John Roberts were a mistake?", "JINDAL: I think actually putting Roberts, I think putting Kennedy, I think putting -- before them, I think putting Souter on the bench was a mistake. But look, I think the -- the first responsibility starts in the White House. The reality is conservatives have not been willing to stand up for our beliefs, unlike the liberals -- look, you never worry about where the Democratic judges are going to vote, it's always the conservatives. You've never had a Democratic judge wake up and say, surprise, I've evolved, I've become a conservative.", "It's always the Republicans, because we have presidents that try to find judges with no records, no rulings, no writings. I'll tell you, I am going to have a litmus test. For judges, I'm going to find judges that are conservative, judges that are going to be pro-life, judges that are going to follow \"The Constitution,\" judges, by the way, that are going to follow the American law, not international law.", "They're not appointed there to interpret international law, they're there to apply \"The United States Constitution.\" Judges understand, their job is not to write law. If they want to write law, they should run for the Senate or the House.", "JINDAL: It's time for a Republican president as the next commander in chief, I will do as the Democrats have done. I will appoint bold judges that are actually consistent with my values that will be conservatives and enforce the Senate --", "TAPPER: Thank you, Governor.", "Senator Graham, I want to give you an opportunity to respond --", "(APPLAUSE)", "TAPPER: -- I would note that Anthony Kennedy, was, of course, a Ronald Reagan appointee.", "Senator Graham, do you stand by your vote for John Roberts?", "GRAHAM: He's one of the most qualified men to ever come before the United States Senate and I don't agree with his decision, but 99 times out of 100, I will.", "To the Republicans, the biggest prize on the table in 2017 is the presidency. If it is Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden or Bernie Sanders, they are going to pick people that we will disagree with all the time.", "Please understand, we have to win this election. The court's at stake. It is the most important reason for us to turn out, to make sure we don't lose the judiciary for decades to come.", "(APPLAUSE)", "TAPPER: Senator Santorum, do you stand by your vote for John Roberts?", "SANTORUM: Well, contrary to what Governor Jindal said, Governor -- Justice Roberts had a long record and it was a long, good record. And so he made a bad decision on -- a couple of bad decisions on ObamaCare but he's made a lot of great decisions, too.", "And so I don't -- I don't regret at all standing up for John Roberts but, you know, it's easy to sit out in Louisiana and talk about how, you know, well, I'd be tougher.", "I fought when I was in the United States Senate. We fought, for the first time, to defeat justices and judges that Bill Clinton nominated and I fought with President Bush to defend his nominees, to push even a filibuster, breaking the filibuster. I led that fight against someone who didn't want to end the filibuster in order for us to get good, conservative justices.", "So I have been there on the front line, fighting for judges and conservative justices and I will do so as president like none other.", "TAPPER: Governor Jindal, I'm going to give you 30 seconds to respond.", "JINDAL: Thank you, Jake. But look, it's not a minor ruling. Justice Roberts twice rewrote the law to save ObamaCare, the biggest expansion of government, creating a new entitlement when we can't afford the government we've got today, an expansion of socialism in our country.", "It's not that he got a minor ruling wrong. This is twice he rewrote the law. Now, look, I have a lot of respect for these senators that have big bladders. They give great speeches in the Senate. And I respect that.", "I've actually signed the executive order. I've actually signed a law protecting religious liberty in the state of Louisiana.", "It's not 99-1. The one that he got wrong was a big one. Twice he bent over backwards to save ObamaCare. If the Republicans had voted the way that we should -- they should have, we would still have our 19th Amendment rights and ObamaCare would not be the law of the land.", "TAPPER: Let me bring back Hugh Hewitt.", "HEWITT: Governor Jindal, Senator Graham just said it's all about winning and, in fact, if former Secretary of State Clinton is the successor to President Obama, none of this matters and all this conversation is beside the point.", "In the Washington elite, they have a habit of saying nice things about each other until election time. Senator Graham has praised Secretary of State Clinton as a great choice to be the secretary of state, as a national treasure.", "Can anyone from inside of Washington win this election cycle, having praised Secretary of State Clinton that way?", "JINDAL: No. And it's not only whether they can win. They shouldn't win this election cycle.", "One of the things I do agree -- and I want to thank Donald Trump after I've criticized him for everything from being a narcissist to an egomaniac -- one of the things he was right about was to say nonsense to the D.C. establishment. It is time to fire all of them. You've got a choice between honest Socialists on the Left, like Bernie Sanders, and lying conservatives on the Right.", "We have got the majority; what good has it done us? See, they said they were going to stop amnesty. They said they were going to repeal ObamaCare. They didn't do either. Now they're not even willing to fight to defund Planned Parenthood. They've already -- McConnell has already waved the white flag of defeat.", "They are not willing to stand up to fight for the issues that count. I think it is time to have term limits. I think it's time to have part-time citizen legislators. Let's pay them a per diem instead of a six-figure salary, stop them from being seven-figure lobbyists. Let's also pay them a per diem for every day they don't go to D.C. Let's keep them out of D.C., working in the real --", "(CROSSTALK)", "JINDAL: -- let's make them live under the same rules and laws they apply to the rest of us. Not only shouldn't they be elected, they can't be elected. Let's fire all of them from their current positions.", "(APPLAUSE)", "HEWITT: Senator Graham, took a shot at there and you're having a good debate but there is this problem of Washington elites and saying wonderful things about each other.", "GRAHAM: I've been called a lot of things but never elite before. My dad owned a liquor store, a bar and a poolroom.", "So only in America can you go from the back of a liquor store to being an elite.", "HEWITT: Is that responsive to calling Hillary Clinton a national treasure, Senator?", "GRAHAM: I introduced her at a conference about Africa. I thought Secretary Clinton did a good job when it came to dealing with our problems in Africa, particularly among women. George W. Bush set $40 billion aside and Rick Santorum helped him and President Bush wiped out an entire -- wiped out AIDS and malaria for an entire generation of young African children.", "Secretary Clinton --", "(APPLAUSE)", "GRAHAM: -- Secretary Clinton did a good -- here's my problem with Secretary Clinton.", "Where the hell were you on the night of the Benghazi attack?", "How did you let it become a death threat to begin with?", "And why did you lie about what happened to these people?", "GRAHAM: And if you want a new change in terms of foreign policy, don't pick her, because she's his secretary of state.", "I've got a real good chance of beating her, because I don't say things bad about her all the time -- just when she deserves it. And her definition of flat broke and mine are a little bit different.", "HEWITT: But Senator, can you go back and forth that way, and expect to have an argument with the American people to persuade them about that?", "GRAHAM: Well, Ronald Reagan did a couple of really big things that we should all remember.", "He sat down with Tip O'Neill, the most liberal guy in the entire House. They started drinking together. That's the first thing I'm going to do as president. We're going to drink more.", "(APPLAUSE)", "And what did this -- two great Irishmen do? They found a way to save Social Security from bankruptcy by adjusting the age of retirement from 65 to 67.", "So, yes, I will say nice things at times about Democrats. Yes, I will work them -- work with them.", "(LAUGHTER)", "I will put the country ahead of party. Absolutely I want to work with them. At the end of the day, Hugh, I'm lucky to be standing here. I'm the first in my family to ever go to college. Neither one of my parents finished high school. Darline's here with me tonight. We owned a restaurant...", "HEWITT: Thank you, Senator.", "GRAHAM: Well, wait a minute. We...", "HEWITT: Thank you, senator.", "GRAHAM: You asked me a question. This is important. Republicans need to tell the American people we get it as to who you are.", "When my mom died, I was 21. When my dad died, when I was 22. We were wiped out financially. If it weren't for Social Security survivor benefit check coming into Darline, we wouldn't have made it. I don't need a lecture from Democrats about Social Security.", "HEWITT: Thank you, Senator.", "GRAHAM: I want to save it, just like Ronald Reagan did.", "(APPLAUSE)", "HEWITT: Let's talk about the economy, if We could.", "Governor Pataki.", "PATAKI: Yes?", "HEWITT: Jeb Bush and Donald Trump are both proposing raising taxes on hedge fund managers who pay at a lower rate. Governor Pataki, you were the governor of New York, home of Wall Street.", "Do you agree that hedge fund managers need to be paying a higher rate?", "PATAKI: I would throw out the entire corrupt tax code.", "(APPLAUSE)", "It's a symbol of the corruption and the power of the lobbyists and the special interests in Washington. It is 74,000 pages of incomprehensible gobbledygook.", "What I would do is get rid of the 1.4 million every year in exemptions and loopholes, dramatically lower the rates. The normal American person is paying higher taxes than they should because of loopholes, and one of them is that carried interest loophole.", "I would tax that income the same as ordinary income. I'd lower the rate to 24 percent for all Americans, but I would not give a special break to the Wall Street fat caps -- fat cats.", "HEWITT: So you are with Jeb Bush and Donald Trump on the hedge fund?", "PATAKI: It's hard for me to say I'm with Donald trump on anything, but on this issue, I agree with him. But let me just make one other point.", "It's not just throwing out the tax code to break the back of the special interests that control Washington. It's other reforms. I would propose a law -- right now there are over 400 former members of the House and Senate who are registered lobbyists in Washington. I would propose a law on day one, you serve one day in the House or Senate, there's a lifetime ban on you ever being a lobbyist in Washington, D.C.", "You get elected, you go back home. You don't stay and support the special interests.

Are you the fourth?", "JINDAL: Two things, Jake. One, I'm absolutely for all of these carve-outs and loopholes and special interests for as -- they get lobbyists. They get sweetheart deals you and I and the rest of this audience couldn't get.", "So as part of an overall comprehensive tax reform that has a lower, flatter tax code, sure. As a single, I am just to raise taxes, no. I don't want to give the government more money.", "The government has grown over this president where now, it's going to overwhelm the American economy. We've got to cut the size of the government economy.", "Nobody else running for president has done that. I'm the only candidate. I've cut my state budget 26 percent. Everybody else talks about it, we have done it.", "So, there's a part of overall tax reform that cuts rates, flattens and lowers the tax code, sure. But I'm not for raising taxes on anybody. We already have too much money going to D.C.", "HEWITT: Let's stay on the topic of taxes.", "PATAKI: Can I just...", "HEWITT: I want to bring in my colleague, Dana Bash.", "BASH: Senator Santorum, you just heard Governor Jindal and Governor Pataki talk about tax reform.", "Jeb Bush has proposed a tax reform plan, and in it, he limits deductions, including the popular home mortgage deduction. Would you do the same as president?", "SANTORUM: Actually, I'm going to be proposing a plan, I call it the 20/20 perfect vision for America as flat tax, a 20 percent flat tax on income, 20 percent flat tax on capital gains and on corporations.", "We eliminate all the deductions, special interest provisions and corporations. We deal with the carried interest issue, because everybody pays the same 20 percent. So, there's no advantage as to how you take your income. That will create growth.", "We're going to allow expensing for corporations.", "SANTORUM: For manufacturing, again, I print -- I pledged, when I announced that I was going to run for president on the factory floor that I would make America the number one manufacturer in the world. Why? Because we need to put Americans back to work.", "Hard working Americans, who are not doing well in this economy, and we start creating jobs here, and manufacturing. These people from all skill levels are going to be able to work. We put a 20 percent rate on corporations, we're competitive with almost every country in the world. We allow for expensing, we have a three year phase in. We start at zero for manufacturers, phase it up to 20. You're going to see an enormous investment of capital, and equipment. You're going to see people -- you're going to have problems finding folks are going to be able to work in manufacturing. That's how many jobs we're going to create.", "So, the answer is, you know, we're going to lower, and flatten taxes. We're going to put government on a -- on a budget. A 10 percent across the board cut...", "BASH: ...times up, Senator.", "SANTORUM: ...employment. We've got a lot of plans.", "BASH: ...OK, times up, Senator. Governor, just to bring you back into this, you said that you would be OK with what is effectively raising taxes on hedge fund managers as part of a tax reform plan. Would you aslo be for doing away with people's deductions for their mortgages.", "PATAKI: No, I would not. I would keep that deduction. I would lower the rates dramatically, so, yes, that root that has a special carve out would pay more, but everybody else is going to pay less.", "I would keep the home mortgage deduction, the charitable deduction, and others. And, by the way, you know, I agree with Rick on manufacturing, but my approach is different. I would pass a rate on manufacturing of 12 percent, the lowest in the developed world so we can make this America again. I know how important those jobs are.", "When I work -- went through college, Christmas and summer vacations, I worked in a factory. My grandparents worked in a factory. We have the opportunity now with lower energy costs, with the world labor cost getting higher, to make things in America so we don't have to worry about China.", "Lower the tax burden on manufacturing, improve the work skills...", "TAPPER: ...Thank you, Governor...", "PATAKI: ...of Americans. Get rid of job killing regulations. If we're going to...", "TAPPER: ...Thank you, Governor...", "PATAKI: ...If we're going to make this America...", "TAPPER: ...I want to turn -- you're going to be involved in the next question...", "SANTORUM: ...Let me just...", "TAPPER: ...Senator Graham...", "SANTORUM: ...He talked about manufacturing, and the fact is that we have a zero percent rate that faces the 20, we'd have a seven percent repatriation, so money -- about two trillion dollars over seas...", "TAPPER: ...Thank you, Senator...", "SANTORUM: ...Would come back, and be invested in equipment here. We will create more jobs with this plan, than any plan out...", "TAPPER: ...Thank you Senator. Senator Graham, I want to turn to the minimum...", "GRAHAM: If you want to see manufacturing, come to South Carolina...", "TAPPER: ...Well, let's talk about South Carolina...", "GRAHAM: ...We'll show 'ya.", "TAPPER: ...Senator, let's turn to the minimum wage.", "(LAUGHTER)", "TAPPER: Senator Santorum is the only person on the stage who has proposed increasing the federal minimum wage. How would that affect South Carolinians? Do you agree with Senator Santorum that the federal minimum wage should be increased?", "GRAHAM: Well, I know this. That when my mom and dad owned a restaurant, the bar, the pool room, that if you increased the minimum wage it'd been hard to hire more people.", "Hillary Clinton has a list a mile long to help the middle class. We're talking all around this. The middle class for the last six and a half years has been squeezed, and squeezed hard.", "To the middle class, I understand who you are. You're one broken down car from not going on vacation. You're from one sick child away from having to change your whole budget.", "Here's what I want to do as your president. I want to grow this economy. When Boeing came to South Carolina to build a 787, everybody paid more they would have lost their employees to Boeing. If you're a waitress out there wanting more money, I'm not going to increase the minimum wage, I'm going to try to create an environment where somebody else will open up a restaurant across the street to hire you away at a higher rate, or they'll have to pay you more to keep you.", "You got to borrow money to create jobs in this country. Banking is locked down because of Dodd-Frank. The tax code is a complete mess, but nobody's talked about the elephant in the room, which is debt. Not one more penny to the federal government until w2e come up with a plan to get out of debt.", "TAPPER: Senator Graham, thank you so much. Senator Santorum...", "(APPLAUSE)", "TAPPER: Senator Graham is suggesting that your proposal would not allot South Carolinians to hire more workers.", "SANTORUM: Lindsay, what percentage of American workers make the minimum wage right now?", "GRAHAM: It's probably a small bit, but the ones that get it...", "SANTORUM: It's less than one percent.", "GRAHAM: Yeah, but I...", "SANTORUM: ...So, what you're saying, what every Republican's up here saying is we're against the minimum wage because, if you're not for increasing it, than whoevers making the minimum wage right now...", "GRAHAM: ...Have you ever thought why all of us say that...", "SANTORUM: ...The answer is Republicans don't believe in a floor wage in America. Fine, you go ahead and make that case to the American public, I'm not going to. Not from a party that supported bailouts. I didn't, but this party did.", "MALE: (INAUDIBLE)", "SANTORUM: Not from a party that supports special interest tax provisions for a whole bunch of other businesses, and, but, when it comes to hardworking Americans who are at the bottom of the income scale, we can't provide some level of income support? What I've proposed is not anything but the (ph) presidents (ph) proposed (ph) I believe that would be harmful to the American public, but a $.50 cents an hour increase over three years, which is what I'm proposing.", "SANTORUM: So we would have a minimum wage which would be roughly in the area of what it's been historically, about 5 percent of wages.", "To me, if you're going to talk to 90 percent of American workers -- by the way, 90 percent of American workers don't own a bar. They don't own a business. They work for a living. They're wage -- most of them are wage earners.", "And Republicans are losing elections because we're not talking about them. All we want to talk about is, what happened to our business? There are people who work in that business.", "I was at a -- I was at the convention four years ago, and on the signs -- on all of the seats the night I spoke was a sign that said, \"We built that,\" because Barack Obama had talked about how businesses didn't build their own businesses.", "Then we trotted out one small-business person after another for almost an hour that night talking about how they built their businesses. And that's wonderful.", "But you know what we didn't do? We didn't bring one worker on that stage.", "How are you going to win, ladies and gentlemen? How are we going to win if 90 percent of Americans don't think we care at all...", "TAPPER: Thank you, Senator.", "SANTORUM: ... about them and their chance to rise...", "TAPPER: Thank you, Senator.

Ambassador John Bolton, a Republican, is pushing for a U.S. military strike against Iran, against its nuclear facilities.", "Senator Graham, would you authorize, as president, a nuclear strike against -- I mean, sorry -- a strike against Iran's nuclear facilities?", "GRAHAM: If I believed they were trying to break out and get a bomb, absolutely. And here's the most important thing: they know I would if I had to.", "And none of us are going to be able to defend this country adequately until we rebuild our military. A weak economy, a military in decline, the world on fire, does that sound familiar to you?", "Michael, does that sound familiar to you?", "The first thing I'm going to do as commander in chief on day one is call the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and say, what do you need that you don't have?", "We're cutting our military; we're on track to have the smallest Army since 1940, the smallest Navy since 1915 and John Kasich says he wants to close more bases. I want to rebuild our military and I want the Iranians to know that, if I had to, I would use it.", "The worst nightmare in the world is a radical Islamic regime with a weapon of mass destruction.

And that is to have a strong America, a strong military and a resolve where the Iranians know that not only are we going to reject this deal on day one and reimpose sanctions but, if they move forward with the nuclear program, their safety for those facilities will be at risk.", "I'll tell you a couple of things I'd do. I'd give the Israelis bombs called MOPs, massive ordnance penetrators. Give them to Israel. Let the Iranians know we're prepared to work with Israel to make sure they never have a nuclear weapon.", "And let me point out that Hillary Clinton, supporting this deal, she was the senator from New York on September 11th, she saw what happened at the hands of radical Islam. This is the senator who did the reset program with Russia, who allowed the Middle East to deteriorate to flames, who has lied about Benghazi and is now supporting the Iranian deal.", "That's the opponent we're going to have next November.

I can do this.", "HEWITT: Senator Santorum, stay on that: any means necessary?", "Is that what you meant to say?", "Is that what's still on this table after this, what many of us believe is a catastrophic deal?", "SANTORUM: As you know, Hugh, 12 years ago I authored the Iran Freedom Support Act, which put sanctions on the Iran nuclear program as we came within four votes of passing a very strong version of that. The four people who opposed on the floor: Joe Biden, John Kerry, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. And we came four votes short.", "But for 12 years, I have been laser-beam focused on the issue of Iran with a nuclear weapon. Why? Because I understand who they are.", "Yes, they are radical Islamists, that's true. But their particular version of it, which is an apocalyptic version, which is a death cult, they believe in bringing about the end of the -- end of the world.

That issue came to a head last month when Puerto Rico defaulted on a $58 million bond payment, the first in what is expected to be several defaults if the government cannot find appropriate measures to further raise revenue, decrease costs or restructure its debt. Garcia Padilla has called Puerto Rico's debts \"unpayable.\"", "But those efforts have been stymied by conservative opposition to expanding Chapter 9 bankruptcy protections in Congress. Opponents of the measure say that Puerto Rico should first take steps to decrease spending and balance its budget. Rubio, who has opposed legislation that would expand Chapter 9 to the territory, risks alienating Puerto Rican voters in his home state by taking a position against granting Puerto Rico Chapter 9 protections \u2014 but simultaneously risks alienating donors, particularly among the influential billionaire Koch brothers' network, if he were to support the measure.\u00a0In the meantime, Rubio has\u00a0taken the measures off the table but does not seem to have ruled them out unilaterally.", "\u201cSo far, Hillary Clinton\u2019s liberal hosts in San Juan today have failed to propose any serious measures to fix Puerto Rico\u2019s economic challenges,\u201d Rubio wrote in an op-ed Friday. \u201cBy turning America away from the Obama agenda that Hillary Clinton would expand, and instead implementing my conservative agenda, we can create favorable conditions for a Puerto Rican renaissance as part of a new American economy in the 21st century.\u201d", "Rubio also called for a resolution to Puerto Rico\u2019s status as a territory, calling for a \u201cfederal sponsored\u201d vote on statehood."], "b_author2": []}

That figure is four \u2014 six if you look at the previous 12\u00a0months, which would include the ambush of two New York City officers last December. That\u2019s six too many, but six deaths (four total incidents)\u00a0out of 550,000 to 1.1 million cops in America (see the note below for an explanation of why this figure is a range), in a country of 320 million people, is a very small number.

Of course, many or most of\u00a0those killed by police this year may\u00a0have been justified killings. But of the 104 killed in August, 13 were unarmed. Because this is the first year that organizations have launched projects to collect these figures, we can\u2019t say if the numbers are going up or down. But according to the FBI\u2019s (admittedly flawed, almost certainly low) data, last year was the worst for killings by cops ", ".", "Of course, the cold-blooded murder of Deputy Goforth is a terrible tragedy. And Walker is certainly correct that there is more scrutiny of policing today, particularly over the past year or two, than there has been in the past. The Obama administration has also been more aggressive about investigating police departments that have shown a pattern of abuse than the George W. Bush administration was.\u00a0But Walker is simply wrong when he tries to use Goforth\u2019s death to say that more oversight and scrutiny of cops have made the job more dangerous. There\u2019s just no evidence of that. All the available evidence suggests precisely the opposite.", "Moreover, you\u2019d think that someone who professes to believe in limited government would\u00a0", " more oversight of a government institution.

See a good discussion of that ", ". But for these figures, Wang consistently used data from the FBI\u2019s Uniform Crime Reports, which put the current total number of law enforcement personnel at about 540,000. Estimates\u00a0from other agencies put the total as high as 1.1 million. But that would make the rate of killings even lower. For our purposes, the point is that the raw number of cops murdered on the job is in a general decline, even as the number of cops on the street has gone up.)"], "b_author2": []}

For most of the past two years, the people running to replace President Barack Obama have been satisfied to blame his leadership, and his failure to act early and decisively in Syria, for the rise of the Islamic State. The humanitarian crisis in eastern Europe has spawned a new question: What should Americans do to help?", "Hugh Hewitt, the Orange County-based radio host who will lob some questions at next week\u2019s CNN-sponsored presidential debate, has started asking candidates what they\u2019d do about the refugees. When former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum called in, Hewitt \u2013 a fellow Catholic \u2013 asked if he agreed with Pope Francis\u2019s call for Christians to welcome refugees into their homes.", "\u201cWe already take in 70 percent of UN refugees in the world today,\u201d Santorum told Hewitt. \u201cThe best thing we can do is to resettle them close to their homes. And that is in neighboring countries and camps and places so when the violence has abated, they can go back home.\u201d", "Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who like Santorum will be relegated to CNN\u2019s \u201cundercard\u201d debate, took a similar approach. \u201cThese are Christians leaving Syria because of genocide being committed in Syria,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I\u2019m President of the United States, we would come up with a plan so people wouldn\u2019t have to leave Syria.\u201d", "There were so many more possible answers, though, and Hewitt would keep trying to elicit them. In other forums, Donald Trump had seemed open to the idea of welcoming more refugees. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) had suggested that any refugees needed to be screened for possible radicalism.", "\u201cI live near Little Saigon, where most of the refugees from the 1970s came.

As Wonkblog's Max Ehrenfreund ", " Monday, there are probably only two ways that the practice could be overturned.", "The first would be to somehow persuade the Supreme Court to overturn the 1898 ruling,\u00a0", ", which established how the 14th Amendment would be enforced.

Wong was born in San Francisco to Chinese parents, which the court ruled was sufficient to make him a citizen.", "But the Supreme Court is hard to steer, as many presidents have learned. That has left\u00a0one alternative recourse for Trump or any other person hoping to end birthright citizenship: amending the Constitution again.", "Amending the Constitution is notoriously hard, which is why it has happened only 27 times in American history \u2014 10\u00a0of which were passed en masse when our country was founded. It requires either 1) two-thirds approval in the House and Senate, followed by ratification of three-quarters of the states, or 2) the development of amendments at a constitutional convention called by two-thirds of the states and then ratified by three-quarters. Only the former method has been used.", "It's a bit tricky to extrapolate from existing polling about birthright to attitudes about permanently altering the Constitution, so it's also hard to say exactly what might happen if such an amendment were actually proposed. But it's worth noting that the subject of birthright is far more common on the right. The most common form of opposition to birthright citizenship has been against \"anchor babies,\" a term used to refer to children of people who come to the United States, often illegally, to have babies who can then eventually take advantage of the natural-born right to be a citizen.

That's more than a quarter of Democratic senators, for what it's worth, and a fifth of House Democrats. (It's a little easier if he convinces the independent senators, shown in yellow. One of them, however, is Bernie Sanders, who seems unlikely to join Team Trump.)", "Even if Trump managed to persuade those 57 people to join with him \u2014 or however many it is after the 2016 election, which will probably move the Senate back toward the Democrats \u2014 he still has the much larger hurdle of getting the amendment ratified.", "The Constitution provides for ratification by either state legislatures or \"ratifying conventions\" in the states. If states go the legislature route and the vote is partisan, Trump would need five non-GOP-controlled\u00a0states to fall in line, even with the Republican dominance in state legislatures. (Meaning state houses and assemblies, not state senates.)", "Trump would need to twist arms in slightly Democratic legislatures (of which there are four) and get technically nonpartisan Nebraska on board to hit the required 38-state total. That's assuming\u00a0he held nominally Republican-controlled states such as Colorado and Minnesota, which is not a fair assumption.", "By now you've gotten the point.

Republicans might\u00a0support undoing birthright citizenship for political reasons, but from a practical standpoint, it would require a massive amount of political will and effort.", "The only thing a politician could promise that would be harder would be, say, promising to build a giant, hundreds-of-miles-long wall and getting another country to pay for it."], "b_author2": []}

For those who do not receive health insurance through their employer, Walker would provide refundable tax credits to those who purchase their own insurance. The tax credits would be determined by age, not income, starting at a $900 credit for those under the age of 17 and maxing out at $3,000 for those between the ages of 50 and 64. These tax credits would replace the subsidies that the Affordable Care Act provides to low-income individuals. \u00a0Those who sign up for a health savings account through their insurance provider would receive a $1,000 tax credit, and Walker would increase the amount of money people can deposit tax-free into those accounts.", "Walker would also allow people to shop for plans across state lines.

States could help these individuals by\u00a0starting their own programs for high-risk patients.", "For the third step -- making health care more efficient, effective and accountable -- Walker says he would allow states to\u00a0set their own rules in allowing 20-something children to stay on their parents' plans and on other issues.

He won the Iowa GOP caucuses and came in second to Sen. John McCain in the overall Republican delegate count. I myself really liked Huckabee: He had great executive experience, stronger social conservative credentials than McCain or Mitt Romney, and he deftly advocated the kind of \u201ccompassionate conservatism\u201d that might work well in a general election.", "How far Huckabee has fallen.", " shows that Huckabee has indeed retained significant support among just the sorts of people you would expect \u2013 evangelicals, presumably of the sort who watched his show on Fox.

Whatever you think of the Iran nuclear deal (and there are serious reasons to oppose it), comments about the murderous intentions of the president are ridiculous.

It was here after months of slogging across the state with little to show for it, he suddenly began to gain traction just before the 2012 caucuses. Against the odds, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/01/19/politics/iowa-caucus/\">he defeated Mitt Romney by just a handful of votes</a>. But by a twist of cruel fate, the caucus ballots were counted incorrectly and he <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/01/19/politics/iowa-caucus/\">wasn't declared winner</a> until long after it mattered to give him the bump he sorely needed. He still went on to become Romney's chief rival in the 2012 primaries, and lasted until April, long enough to give put himself in respectable second place. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\"><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/interactive/2016/politics/election-candidate-matchmaker/\">Related: 2016 Candidate Matchmaker</a></p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Santorum had thought his runner-up status would have earned him respect with voters and with the party in 2016, but the country had changed. He would be like Ronald Reagan, a man who also won 11 states and returned the next election cycle in victory and transformed the conservative movement, he suggested to audiences across the country.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">But Santorum again struggled. This cycle was even more difficult for him, as he had to share attention with Donald Trump and was always relegated to the media ghetto of humiliating \"undercard debates,\" which were never held in prime time. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">But he slogged on, hoping that lightning would strike twice.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">On Sunday, while much of the evening was focused on the positive, Santorum used the opportunity to vent his frustration with a process that he contends kept him down. For months he, and other candidates, have complained about the debate process, and the media's relentless wall-to-wall Trump coverage.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"It's very frustrating for a lot of us. But I can't really blame a lot of the media for focusing attention on somebody who's going to make them money,\" he said.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Santorum, however, didn't train his anger on the media, as other candidates so often do. For him, the real responsibility for the state of the race lay at the feet of the Republican National Committee. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"It's one thing if you're a profit-making company...it's another thing to be sanctioned by the Republican National Committee,\" Santorum said, his voice suddenly sounding louder and angrier. \"And because of that sanction, you have a responsibility beyond just making money. The RNC did not hold these new channels to the standard that should be required, which is that everybody one of our presidential candidates will be treated with dignity and respect. Period. Everyone. There is no under-card! There is no kids' table! Everybody is treated with respect. Why? Because they are running for the nomination of our party, and we demand it. But they never did.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">In the corner of the room stood Foster Friess, Santorum's billionaire super PAC financier from Wyoming, wearing a beige wide brim hat and cowboy jacket that looks more Sundance than Sioux City. Over the past few years, Friess has funded Santorum's efforts by writing multi-million dollar checks to his super PAC, the Red, White and Blue Fund. He has remained fiercely loyal to the Pennsylvania senator the entire time in both good times and bad. And on this final night, he was here to see it through the end. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"Think of the witness that he gives,\" Friess told CNN. \"I don't care if he doesn't make it to dog catcher. I'm willing to pay for this guy's example of being a bridge builder, of being civil, of having politics work like it should. The money I've spent was well worth it to get the message out.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Friess declined to say whom he might support if Santorum drops out.  </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Santorum used the night's opportunity to take questions, just like his hundreds of other townhall meetings. One person asked about his relationship with Israel, another about his plan for Obamacare -- and he answered them in detail.  </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">When it came near the time to end, Santorum made his final appeal for his small band of true believers to fan out to the caucuses and put up a noble showing for him on Monday. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\"><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/30/politics/iowa-road-trip-caucus-takeaways-king/index.html\">Related: 6 keys to the Iowa caucuses</a></p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Santorum reached the dramatic crescendo of his emotional and heartfelt pitch to the small number of loyal and adoring Iowans gathered with him. The part where he tells them -- as he has been saying for the past five years, in town hall meetings and in cold church basements and those wretched dawn breakfasts with the greasy eggs and the Lincoln Day suppers and in rural diners where only one person would come to see him -- that it's up to them to vote their conscience. Then a loud cell phone rang in the audience, turning everyone's gaze to the back of the room instead of on the senator giving the most important part of his final speech in a state he has painstakingly devoted the past half decade of his life.  </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Santorum didn't stop: \"If you lead tomorrow, I'm telling you, you will set this race on a completely different path. You did it four years ago.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The questions that naturally follow -- who will Santorum endorse? How will he pay off his tens of thousands of dollars in campaign debt? Where does a man like him go from here? -- could be answered at another time. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">When Santorum finished, the campaign's Iowa State Director, Walt Rogers, presented him with a shirt and fleece bearing the logo of the Pizza Ranch restaurant, where Santorum held more than 120 events over the years. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\"> \"No matter what happens, we're going to miss you,\" Rogers told him. \"We look forward to what God has in store for Rick Santorum.\" </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">As the event was about to conclude, a woman in the back stood up, waved her arms and shouted over the room, \"Can we pray?\" </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Rogers put his arm over his boss, and delivered the Santorum campaign's benediction. </p>"], "article_highlights": ["Barring a miracle, the Iowa caucuses will likely mark the end of Rick Santorum's long quest for the presidency", "On Sunday night, his campaign assembled devoted volunteers, friends, family and supporters for one final Iowa hurrah"], "article_author": ["Chris Moody", "Jeremy Moorhead", "Alex Lee"]}

That decision for many evangelicals between head and heart could very well decide who wins Iowa on Monday night after a tight race between the Texas senator and the real estate magnate. <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/30/politics/des-moines-register-poll-donald-trump-ted-cruz-hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders/index.html\">The Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics Iowa Poll </a>released Saturday evening found Trump leading Cruz 28% to 23%.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\"><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/28/politics/donald-trump-ted-cruz-anti-establishment/\">How Trump and Cruz went from Ivy League to anti-establishment</a></p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">While many had assumed that Cruz would have a lock on white evangelical voters, particularly as support for retired pediatric neurosurgeon Ben Carson has waned, Trump has shown surprising strength within that voter group. In a Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist poll released Thursday, Trump notched the support of 31% of evangelical Christians to Cruz's 28%. But in a poll of likely Iowa caucus participants released earlier by Quinnipiac University, Cruz led Trump among white born-again evangelicals 34% to 27%.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Nationally, Trump was leading Cruz among GOP evangelicals 39% to 25%, according to a CNN/ORC poll released Tuesday. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Florida Sen. Marco Rubio's efforts to reach evangelicals also appear to be paying dividends after a month in which he has emphasized his faith. Though Rubio is far behind Trump and Cruz in Iowa polls, a number of evangelicals mentioned him as their third choice in interviews over the past week and he is rising in the polls. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Evangelical voters are the most reliable bloc of caucus-goers on the Republican side and they have had outsized influence in past election cycles. In 2012, some 57% of voters entering the Iowa caucuses in 2012 described themselves as evangelical Christians, according to polling by the Pew Research Center\u2014and they helped Rick Santorum narrowly edge out Mitt Romney in Iowa, just as they helped former Arkansas Gov.

When asked about his faith, voters here sometimes bring up Trump's embarrassing gaffe at Liberty University where he quoted from \"Two Corinthians\" instead of \"Second Corinthians,\" or the event in Ames last year where he said he didn't think he'd ever sought forgiveness from God.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Trump went a long way to buttressing his credibility by winning an endorsement from evangelical leader Jerry Falwell Jr. of Liberty University, though Falwell's decision caused an uproar within the Liberty University alumni community.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Falwell <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/30/politics/donald-trump-jerry-falwell-iowa-2016/index.html\">doubled down on his endorsement Saturday </a>night as he appeared with Trump on the campaign trail. His praise was effusive -- at times almost fawning -- as he essentially told the Davenport crowd that he was willing to take the heat over his decision. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Trump, he said at least twice, reminded him of his father, the famed televangelist and Southern Baptist pastor Jerry Falwell Sr. He cited private acts of generosity that he said Trump does not typically boast about -- from financial assistance that he said the mogul offered to a couple who helped him with his broken-down limousine to his aid for an inner city basketball team. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">By way of explaining his endorsement of Trump, Falwell noted that any parent who had a sick child would seek the best doctor they could find.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"It may not be a doctor who goes to your church, but it's the one who has the most experience with that particular illness,\" he said.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">His father, he added, \"was criticized in the late 1970s, early '80s, because he supported Ronald Reagan, a Hollywood actor who had been divorced and remarried, over Jimmy Carter, who was a Sunday school teacher -- a southern Baptist Sunday school teacher,\" Falwell said.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"You know, I think he made the right decision.

We know Jimmy Carter was a great Sunday school teacher; but look how he did as President.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\"><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/29/politics/iowa-caucuses-donald-trump-ted-cruz-marco-rubio-jeb-bush/index.html\">READ: Campaigns lower expectations in Iowa, brace for Trump win</a></p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Trump went a step further on Saturday by releasing a closing message to evangelicals on Facebook, showing the Bible that his mother had given him and thanking conservative Christians for supporting him.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"My mother gave me this Bible, this very Bible, many years ago. In fact it's her writing right here. She wrote the name and my address, and it's just very special to me,\" Trump said in the Facebook video. \"And again, I want to thank the evangelicals. I will never let you down.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">But that's still an open question for some evangelicals here. Seventeen-year-old David Blom said he went to a Trump event last week, in part, to try to get a better sense of the authenticity of his faith. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"Just listening to the language from Trump tonight, he said 'terminated' instead of 'killed' when he was talking about life,\" said Blom, who has trained other students at his school to caucus (many, he said, are leaning toward Trump or Cruz). \"He makes fun of the media, but then he uses the pro-choice, and pro-abortion term instead of what an Iowa evangelical would see as being a person of life and value.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"Life is super important and we can't have a new convert leading the pro-life movement as the Republican nominee,\" the high school senior said.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Surrogates for Cruz have traveled the state emphasizing Cruz's consistency on social issues like marriage, abortion and religious liberty.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\"><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/30/politics/ted-cruz-keep-the-promise-super-pac/index.html\">READ: Main Cruz super PACs struggled to raise money in fall and winter</a></p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"Ted Cruz is going to be the same today as he was yesterday, as he will be tomorrow,\" former Texas Gov. Rick Perry told voters at a Cruz event in Albia.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">On Saturday, the head of the Cruz campaign's \"99 Pastors\" group, Pastor Joseph Brown, penned an email to more than 150 pastors across Iowa encouraging them to \"prepare to challenge and equip your people for the Iowa Caucus taking place on Monday.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The message was heeded at Lutheran Church of Hope in West Des Moines Sunday morning, where Cruz attended services with his family. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Iowa congressman Steve King, who traveled the state on Cruz's behalf last week, predicted that some evangelical voters enamored by Trump will ultimately flip back to Cruz.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"Two thirds of the people who will come to caucus are full spectrum constitutional Christian conservatives. They are pro-life, they are pro-marriage, they are pro-religious liberty, they're pro-Second Amendment, they are pro-free enterprise and for a strong national defense,\" King said. \"They know what they believe in and they've been for three generations bringing their children up to caucus because it's part of their tradition.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Those voters, he argued, \"are very uneasy about Trump.... They don't know what he's going to do next.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">That is one reason that VanWeelden, a 73-year-old pastor from rural Albia, decided on Cruz. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"He speaks from his heart. He is not an act,\" he said.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">While Trump's taunting jabs at other candidates have amused some GOP voters, they are not in keeping with the language of a man who lives by his Christian faith.\" </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"I like Donald Trump in the way that he's not a politician,\" VanWeelden went on. \"We need somebody that's strong and stands by what he says, but I do believe you don't need to slander people to get there.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Christians, he noted, are \"taught to love our fellow man, not to run him into the ground or condemn him....

Grubbs believes those votes are underrepresented in Iowa polls now. Plus, with colleges in session for this year's caucuses, \"Students for Rand\" set a 10,000-student target. One person involved said they are short of that, but in the still-impressive 6,000 range.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">If Grubbs' math is correct, and caucus turnout is at traditional levels, he believes Paul could be the surprise here and climb into the top tier.

More simply put: Rubio needs the Mitt Romney map.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Yes, he hopes to cut into the Cruz campaign's evangelical base. And Rubio hopes to get a fair slice of the younger voters from Iowa's colleges and universities. But his foundation is the mainstream Republican areas that were Romney's base in both 2008 and 2012.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Donald Trump is one obstacle. The billionaire businessman is drawing votes across the spectrum -- and across the map -- in Iowa. And Rubio and his team are working feverishly in the final days to sway more establishment voters now in the Trump camp.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">But there is another, significant obstacle as Rubio canvasses the Romney map: Jeb Bush. The Bush campaign working the same turf -- and the same voter lists, and the size of former Florida governor's slice of the vote Monday night will go a long way in determining the strength of the Rubio close.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">               </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\"><strong>Thompson, Iowa \u2014 </strong>It has the feel of a nostalgia tour by a memorable band of yesteryear: familiar words, old friends, but smaller crowds and more gray hairs.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">But 2008 Iowa GOP winner Mike Huckabee isn't ready to admit he isn't going platinum this year.

As he retraces those glory days now, he constantly raises the Texas senator's opposition to government rules that benefit Iowa's ethanol industry. And, in a dig at the Canadian-born Cruz, he notes that he shares a hometown with Bill Clinton -- removing any doubt about his eligibility to be president.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">To be sure, Huckabee isn't going to win this time, even if he gets all 18 votes in the room at this stop. But to ignore him is to forget the importance of the math on the margins.

If turnout looks like 2004's 124,000, Hillary Clinton almost certainly wins. If it's closer to 2008's 239,000, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is the likely victor. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\"><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/29/politics/iowa-caucuses-explainer/index.html\">The Iowa caucuses, explained</a></p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Clinton's Iowa operation has long focused on committed Democrats -- those who reliably caucus, many of whom supported her 2008 campaign. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Sanders, meanwhile, has focused his energy on college towns and has pushed hard to bring new participants into the caucus process. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Two counties where Sanders must run up a huge delegate advantage are Johnson, where the University of Iowa is located, and Story, the home of Iowa State University. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">If he loses either -- or Clinton even comes particularly close -- Sanders won't win Iowa. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Polk County, the home of Des Moines and the state's most delegate-rich area, looks more like Clinton's territory: It's the state's largest urban area, and she has campaigned heavily both in its downtown and suburban regions. African-Americans and Latinos, small in number as they are in Iowa, could be the key to a Clinton victory.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">There's another candidate hoping for an expanded electorate: Donald Trump. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The Republican front-runner's appeal to disaffected conservatives -- and some independents and \"Reagan Democrats,\" too -- will be tested immediately. If he succeeds in drawing a huge turnout, it's a positive sign for Trump long past Iowa.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\"><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/29/politics/new-hampshire-primary-voters-republicans-2016/index.html\">Pulse of New Hampshire Republican voters: We are tired of losing</a></p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Texas Sen. Ted Cruz needs to win -- and win with a sizeable margin -- in the 44 counties west of Des Moines, which are more rural and more socially conservative than much of the state. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The establishment-leaning portion of the state could be Polk County and its more heavily-populated neighbors like Story and Dallas. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Northeastern and Southeastern Iowa were Ron Paul territory in 2012. Those areas are more libertarian than conservative, and could be the difference between Trump and Cruz. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Cruz turned Iowa into a boom-or-bust state when he predicted that Trump might run the table if he wins the Hawkeye State and told voters that caucusing for anyone else amounts to supporting Trump. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">That strategy might push him over the top and into first place. But it also means anything else is a bust -- and could leave him limping out of the Hawkeye State into New Hampshire, where Trump is also in the lead.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Monday is also Trump's first time on the ballot. He has consistently boasted about his poll numbers while on the stump. How will he react should he lose, even if only by a couple of points?</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Then there's what Twitter users are calling #Marcomentum: The sense that Florida Sen. Marco Rubio is surging late. Polls show him consistently running third behind Trump and Cruz, and if he manages to come close to those two, it would be a boon among establishment Republicans who are still searching for a candidate with a real path to the nomination. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Early-state results won't just identify front-runners -- they'll winnow what's an especially packed field of contenders on the Republican side. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">If former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, the last two winners of the Iowa GOP caucuses, can't escape the low single digits, they could conclude they have no path to the nomination and drop out -- a move that would likely help Cruz, who appeals to a similar set of voters. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The three governors looking to win the \"establishment lane,\" meanwhile -- Jeb Bush, Chris Christie and John Kasich -- are all looking ahead to New Hampshire. While a stronger-than-expected result in Iowa could help, a poor showing is unlikely to hurt enough for any to drop out. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">On the Democratic side, Sanders would likely benefit most if former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley drops out. But he'd have preferred that it happen before Iowa, the state where O'Malley's support might matter most. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The final days in Iowa have been packed with surprises -- starting with Trump's decision to skip the final debate on Fox News. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Clinton was the subject of tough headlines headed into the weekend as the State Department refused to release 22 of her emails, retroactively classifying them -- and raising the specter, once again, of a lengthy, damaging federal investigation into her private email use during her tenure as secretary of state. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">O'Malley's backers also <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/31/politics/martin-omalley-important-iowa/\">have a choice to make</a>. Democratic Iowa caucus rules say that to reach \"viability,\" a candidate must have support of 15% of the caucus-goers in that precinct. If too few voters support a candidate, those individuals are freed to support another candidate of their choosing.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The former Maryland governor, however, isn't close to 15%. He's <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/31/politics/martin-omalley-important-iowa/\">sitting at 3%</a> in Saturday's Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics poll. His supporters could make the difference for Clinton or Sanders.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">There's also the great unknown that Nature can deliver: A snowstorm is due in Iowa, and while it appears it will hold off until Tuesday, bad weather on caucus night would likely mean more people stay home. </p>"], "article_highlights": [], "article_author": ["Eric Bradner"]}

The question since it's this close, is what will Trump do to win? </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">He caused an uproar last week by pulling out of the Fox News debate\u2014and many said it would hurt him. But the real estate mogul is continuing to maintain a narrow lead over Ted Cruz here. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Typically on the day of the caucuses, candidates race around the state speaking to as many voters as possible, as the capstone to a long retail campaign. But Trump has spent so few nights in Iowa that it was news when he recently stayed at a Holiday Inn here. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">We know that he plans show up at several caucuses around the state Monday -- and even try to speak, though candidates aren't typically allowed to do that. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Who would put it past Trump to pull a stunt on the final day that nails down a win here in the Hawkeye state? We can only begin to guess what that might be.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">There is no question that Ted Cruz has the most sophisticated ground game in Iowa on the GOP side this year. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">But in the age of social media and in a race where one of the candidates has more than five million Twitter followers, will that matter? </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Many previous winners from Jimmy Carter to Rick Santorum pulled off their victories after going county to county, sometimes talking to groups of voters as small as a dozen, and inspiring their volunteers to make sure those people turn out on caucus night. Ted Cruz has followed that traditional model, even visiting Iowa's 99 counties (again) in the final days before the contest. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">His aides boast that they have some 1,530 precinct captains in the 1,681 precincts across Iowa, as well as 12,000 volunteers fanned out across the state. Some 1,000 additional volunteers have come in from out of state since Christmas. Some are so committed that they are living in dormitories by the Des Moines airport that are known as \"Camp Cruz.\" </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">By 8 a.m. on Saturday morning, Camp Cruz was empty because those hard-core Cruz supporters had already fanned out for a day of calls and door-knocking to make sure voters know where to caucus.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Trump's ground game has been more of mystery, in part because his aides won't talk about it, tossing reporters out the door if they try to visit call centers in person. The other unknown factor is that many of Trump's supporters have never caucused before, so the campaign has a big task ahead in ensuring they turn out.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">And we can't underestimate the power of Trump's social media footprint. Some first-time caucus goers who attended his rallies this week told CNN they had already clicked on the link Trump tweeted for the \"caucus finder\" on his website, where supporters can enter their address and zip code to find their caucus. And Trump has been pounding the importance of boosting turnout. In Clinton, Iowa, on Saturday night, he told his supporters that even if they were on their deathbed, he expected them to turn out.  </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Evangelicals are often viewed as the most important voting bloc in Iowa in the GOP caucuses, helping boost conservative candidates Rick Santorum and Mike Huckabee to victory in 2012 and 2008, respectively. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">But this year, they are split between Trump and Cruz, and to a lesser extent Ben Carson and Marco Rubio. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">To everyone's surprise, many <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/31/politics/evangelical-voters-2016-iowa/index.html\">Christian conservatives have rallied around Trump</a> despite his three marriages, marital infidelities and his dramatic evolution on the issue of abortion. Many told CNN in interviews that they admired Cruz's principled and consistent stands on abortion, gay marriage and religious liberty, but simply believe that Trump would make a stronger president. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">To assuage doubts about his faith during his final push, Trump has been campaigning with evangelical leader Jerry Falwell Jr., who has served as a critical character witness for Trump by praising his private generosity and stating that Trump reminds him of his father, famed televangelist Jerry Falwell. Though he's had some embarrassing gaffes when talking about faith -- quoting \"Two Corinthians\" at Liberty University, for example, Trump played up his faith in the final weekend. He went to church on Sunday with his wife. On Saturday, he released a Facebook video showing the Bible that his mother gave him and promising evangelicals that he would never let them down. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Cruz's allies have continued to try to raise doubts about the authenticity of Trump's faith. On Sunday afternoon, Cruz urged evangelicals to choose the candidate who they knew they could count on. \"This is your time to make the decision for the men and women of Iowa to say we can't get fooled again. The stakes are too high. We can't roll the dice.\" </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Bernie Sanders mounted a fierce challenge to Hillary Clinton by drawing on key pieces from the Obama coalition: particularly young voters. Their enthusiasm for Sanders is undisputable as he has drawn enormous crowds at college campuses here in Iowa and across the country and continues to engage with them on social media. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">But he faces one hurdle that Obama didn't have in the 2008 Iowa caucuses: the intersection of geography and the complex rules of the Democratic Caucus. In 2008, the caucuses occurred much earlier in the year on Jan. 3. That meant many Iowa students supporting Obama were dispersed across the state in different precincts because they were still at home on winter break. This year, they are back on campus. That could hurt Sanders because it means they are more concentrated in certain precincts, giving less geographic breadth to his support than Obama's. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The reason that's important is because the Democratic winner in Iowa won't be determined by the overall number of votes. The winner is determined by the number of 'delegate equivalents' marshaled by their supporters in each precinct caucus. It's complicated, but if Sanders' young supporters are concentrated in a certain precincts, he may end up with less state delegate equivalents -- and that could spell a win for Clinton. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Des Moines Register pollster Ann Selzer raised this issue earlier this month when she noted that Sanders has maintained wide leads over Clinton in the three counties that house Iowa State University, the University of Iowa and the University of Northern Iowa. She told the Register that while those counties make up a sizable amount of Sanders' supporter, they only account for 21% of likely caucus participants. So even if Sanders pulls off a big turnout, that caucus quirk could be a strike against him here.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Candidates who campaign here every four years love to talk about the state's reputation for \"Iowa nice\" -- the phrase that comes from the polite, friendly Midwest tradition of Iowa's farmers and voters. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">But this year on the GOP side, those voters seem most taken by a candidate who is known for his bullying taunts of other candidates, reporters and whoever is the target of his Twitter feed that day. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">On Sunday, Trump got increasingly personal in his descriptions of his chief rival: calling Cruz \"a lying guy,\" \"a hated guy\" and \"terrible.\" </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The Iowa Nice tradition seems at odds with the latest Des Moines Register poll, which told us that Trump has among the highest unfavorable ratings of any of the candidates running -- and yet he is at the top of the pack. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Many Iowans say they are tired of \"political correctness.\" This year, that sentiment may trump \"Iowa Nice.\" </p>"], "article_highlights": [], "article_author": ["Maeve Reston", "Gabe Ramirez"]}

You are responsible for all other additional costs that you may incur in the arbitration including, but not limited to attorney's fees and expert witness costs unless CNN is otherwise specifically required to pay such fees under applicable law.  For claims that total more than $75,000, the AAA Rules will govern payment of filing fees and arbitration fees.

CNN and you agree that dispositive motions, including without limitation, motions to dismiss and motions for summary judgment will be allowed in the arbitration.

In the event some or all of these arbitration provisions are determined to be unenforceable for any reason, or if a claim, dispute or controversy is brought that is found by a court to be excluded from the scope of these arbitration provisions, CNN and you agree to waive, to the fullest extent allowed by law, any trial by jury.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The terms of these arbitration provisions will also apply to any claims asserted by you against any present or future parent or affiliated company of CNN to the extent that any such claims arise out of your access to, and/or use of the Site, and/or the provision of content, services, and/or technology on or through the Site.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\"><strong>12.

CNN and you further agree that CNN and you shall not participate in any consolidated, class, or representative proceeding (existing or future) brought by any third party arising under these Terms of Use or in connection with the Site. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the disputes, claims or controversies will not be subject to arbitration and must be litigated in federal court located in New York, New York. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The terms of this provision will also apply to any claims asserted by you against any parent or affiliated company of CNN to the extent that any such claims arise out of your access to, and/or use of the Site, and/or the provision of content, services, and/or technology on or through the Site.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\"><strong>13.

{"article_title": ["Rubio and Bush prepare for war after Iowa"], "article_timestamp": ["Updated 8:01 PM ET, Sun January 31, 2016 "], "article_edsource": ["Des Moines, Iowa (CNN)"], "article_url": ["http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/31/politics/2016-election-jeb-bush-marco-rubio/index.html"], "article_content": ["<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"It will probably thin out to Jeb or Marco,\" said Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., a top Bush surrogate. \"You'll start to see some clarity in a couple weeks.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The thinning-out process begins Monday night here in Iowa, and Rubio's team wants major separation between him and the governors in order to show that the senator is the only viable candidate who can take down Trump.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">According to a CNN average of the last five public polls in Iowa, Rubio is solidly in third place here, coming in at 15% -- well behind Cruz and Trump. But from the perspective of Rubio officials, a third-place is finish is fine with them -- as long as they are solidly ahead of the other establishment favorites, namely Bush, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who all will be competing for the No. 2 spot in New Hampshire.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\"><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/31/politics/cnn-wmur-poll-donald-trump-bernie-sanders/index.html\">READ: CNN/WMUR poll: Trump, Sanders still up in New Hampshire</a></p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">So far, Bush, Christie and Kasich have failed to gain much traction in Iowa, all registering in the low single digits in the polls -- something that could hurt their momentum going forward. But as they've struggled, all three have increasingly focused on New Hampshire, hoping the state's more moderate voters help propel them to finish right behind Trump, who is dominating so far in the state.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">A new CNN-WMUR poll released Sunday shows a muddled race for second and third place in New Hampshire. While Trump wins 30% of the vote, the next closest competitor is Cruz at 12%, followed by Rubio with 11% of the vote, Kasich at 9%, Christie at 8% and Bush at 6%. Just 39% of GOP voters say they've \"definitely\" decided on their candidate.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">From the Rubio perspective, they believe the senator can afford to finish behind Kasich in New Hampshire, who lacks much of an infrastructure beyond the Granite State and doesn't have deep support from the conservative base. While Christie does have greater support among conservatives, according to surveys, he too lacks much of an operation in states that vote after New Hampshire.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Bush, on the other hand, has devoted ample time and resources traveling across the country, including last week where he went to the remote town of Elko, Nevada -- even though the state doesn't vote until Feb. 23. Bush and Rubio have traveled to states that vote in March in a much-faster clip than their rivals. Since mid-June, Bush has made 49 trips to March-voting states, compared to 31 to Rubio. Bush's campaign is investing heavily in Tennessee, a state that votes March 1, and has built coalitions in states as diverse as Colorado and Alabama.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Even if they fall short in New Hampshire, they are increasingly banking on a big showing in South Carolina to turn around a campaign that has underperformed so far.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"South Carolina is a really natural fit for Jeb,\" said Kinzinger.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Even if Bush struggles to break through in New Hampshire, his well-funded super PAC, Right to Rise, can keep him afloat -- and make Rubio's life difficult.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The Bush super PAC has already spent $20 to $22 million attacking Rubio, according to the senator's campaign. Paul Lindsay, a spokesman for the super PAC, wouldn't confirm that number. But he signaled that it was just a start.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"It's less than the figure they quote, but we'll cut Marco some slack since we know he has a penchant for not being able to add up expenses very well,\" Lindsay said. \"We are very prepared for March and believe Jeb will be in a strong position at the end of February.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The Rubio campaign has built an organization that the senator's team believes can sustain well beyond the first four states, even if he fails to win any of them. They've named campaign chairmen in all 50 states and have secured more state legislative endorsements than Bush since late December, totaling 228. The campaign has opened up three offices in South Carolina and two in Nevada, and now has 118 staff -- more than half are working on targeting voters on-the-ground.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Rubio is spending money on TV in Nevada, unlike other campaigns, and is increasingly banking on a strong showing in the Silver State. Since December, Rubio also has traveled for events in Alabama, Florida, Michigan, Missouri, North Carolina, Texas and Minnesota. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">And both Rubio and his campaign will likely have the resources to compete into March. His super PAC, Conservative Solutions PAC, reported $14 million in its bank account through the end of last year.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\"><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/31/politics/evangelical-voters-2016-iowa/index.html\">READ: The agony of Iowa's evangelicals</a></p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Jeff Sadosky, a spokesman for the super PAC, said roughly 55 percent of all negative ads in Iowa were targeting Rubio -- and that the organization had the resources to respond in kind.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"That air cover has been incredibly important as Marco has found himself attacked by Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz and Hillary Clinton,\" Sadosky said of his organization's air war.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The Rubio strategy comes down to this: They hope that they will continue to advance by staying in the top tier of candidates, while under-performing candidates -- namely the governors -- face growing pressure to drop out, allowing him to consolidate their support. They hope that will allow the party to unite behind his candidacy to take on the conservative favorite, potentially Trump.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">On Sunday, Rubio refused to say which state he could win when asked by CNN's Jake Tapper on \"State of the Union,\" saying he's \"not the campaign strategist.\" And while he said that he wouldn't call on anyone to drop out of the race, he added that unity behind an establishment favorite would happen at the \"appropriate time.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"Here's how we win: We win by having more delegates than anyone else, and more than half the delegates,\" Rubio said on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" signaling a long, grueling campaign. \"And I'm very comfortable and confident that we're going to achieve that.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">On Monday, the first task is seeing Cruz come in second to Trump in Iowa, something Rubio advisers believe will mean the beginning of the end for the Texas Republican's campaign. Yet if Cruz pulls off a victory Monday night, he will have upended the race, prompting Rubio and other campaigns to recalibrate.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">No matter what, Cruz said, he'll be in the game for the long run.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"We're running a national campaign,\" Cruz told Tapper Sunday.</p>"], "article_highlights": ["Jeb Bush is now viewed internally as Marco Rubio's biggest threat after the New Hampshire primary", "Bush is the only establishment candidate who has built a national organization"], "article_author": ["Manu Raju"]}

Trump wasn't there to bully him. That's the way I look at it,\" Richardson said. \"I think it helped all of them.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">One woman approached Bush after his event at Dordt College in Sioux Center to commend him. \"You did a much better job in the debate last night last night,\" she said in a comforting tone. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Bush won plaudits among some conservative pundits for appearing to have more command of the stage than in the past. And Bush, in an interview earlier Friday, argued that his best moment came when he \"got the last word\" in during a spat over immigration with Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Levi Vander Molen, a junior at Dordt College, said he is \"100%\" for Cruz, but acknowledged that \"Bush did better without Donald Trump on the stage.\"  </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"I thought he did OK,\" he added. \"I thought he did pretty well, really.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Still it wasn't enough to sway Vander Molen to consider caucusing for Bush. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">It's unclear whether Bush's debate performance and spate of positive headlines will move the needle for him in Monday's contest. He has yet to gain traction in the state despite his super PAC, Right to Rise USA, spending close to $15 million in ads here. Bush's campaign itself has more than 20 paid staffers on the ground in Iowa.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">But it's obvious voters are paying attention and vetting the candidates right until the end. Each of Bush's three events Friday in northwest Iowa drew larger-than-normal crowds for Bush. This was also notable given the area where Bush was campaigning, which is largely known as Rep. Steve King's territory -- and King is heavily supporting Sen. Ted Cruz. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The former Florida governor, despite battling a cold, was in good spirits as he made his final pitch to caucus-goers. His aggressive schedule takes him from one end of the state to the other this weekend with shorter, more prolific town halls, thus giving him exposure to more voters. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">But his sights are still set on New Hampshire, where he's faring better in the poll and competing for a second place finish with four other candidates. Instead of staying in Iowa Monday night for the results, Bush -- like Ohio Gov. John Kasich and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie -- will hold an event in the Granite State that night. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">At a town hall in Sioux City, Bush heralded some of his rivals for being \"fantastic talkers on that stage last night,\" but, in an attempt to draw a contrast to his record as governor, scoffed at what he called their \"really arcane discussions of filing amendments on bills that never passed.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"It was like going to the periodontist,\" he said of the debate.  </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">In keeping with a year-long trend, Bush was asked Friday to compare himself to his brother and father, both former U.S. presidents. He made his normal quip about how he's \"better looking\" than his brother and praised his father for being the \"greatest man alive.\" </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">But he also tried to underscore his own brand, while embracing his family name at the same time.  </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"I'm Jeb, exclamation point,\" Bush said, referring to his campaign logo that notably leaves out his last name but features the punctuation mark after his first name. \"I'm proud to be a Bush.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Bush, as he's been doing in New Hampshire, reminded voters of their prized position in the primary calendar and urged them to choose someone with a \"proven record.\" But he was still honing his closing message.  </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"I hope you'll caucus for me at 7 a.m. -- 7 p.m., excuse me,\" he said to laughs at his first event in Carroll.  \"Don't go at 7 a.m.\" </p>"], "article_highlights": ["Bush, who is polling in the low single digits just days before Monday's Iowa caucuses, seemed to ride a a post-debate high on Friday", "It was the first Republican debate sans Donald Trump, and voters here felt that the absence of the larger-than-life frontrunner helped Bush break through", "\"Trump wasn't there to bully him\""], "article_author": ["Ashley Killough"]}

Those two factors suggest a moderate candidate who posts a strong showing in Iowa could potentially gain support in New Hampshire from this less-committed moderate pool of voters, who typically make up nearly half of GOP primary voters there.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">New Hampshire voters frequently make up their minds in the final days of the contest -- according to exit polls there in 2012, 46% of Republican voters said they made their decision in the last few days, as did 38% of Democratic voters in 2008 - so the results in polls right now are by no means the final word on the race.</p>"], "article_highlights": [], "article_author": ["Jennifer Agiesta"]}

Spokesman Rick Tyler pointed to Cruz's cash on hand, lapping the field by a considerable margin, and said it would put Cruz in a far better position than Marco Rubio and others in the Granite State -- even as they conceded Rubio now entered with momentum.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">It was a victory set into motion two and a half years ago, when Cruz first touched down at the Des Moines Marriott -- only six months after he had been sworn into the Senate. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Cruz was known at the time for ideological purity -- not evangelical fervor -- but over the next few years, he would add to his Christian image, citing Scripture repeatedly in barns and convenience stores as he became more and more tailor-made for Iowa Republicans.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">On that first trip here in August 2013, he met with a network of influential Iowa pastors, the same group he returned to last Monday, just a week before clergymen like them would help decide his fate. And he built his own network of evangelical pastors, recruiting one chief in each county and integrating them into a state leadership team that dwarfed other candidates' in size. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">For much of 2015, Cruz visited Iowa consistently, but not overwhelmingly. He thumbed his nose at GOP rivals who essentially moved to the state in search of lightning strike. But he invested in face time, lingering late on a baseball diamond the day of the gay marriage decision in June and at a high-profile evangelical forum in November on one particularly long Iowa day.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">And he deliberately and conscientiously identified, courted and landed the two major conservative endorsements behind past Iowa winners, Rep. Steve King and Family Leader president Bob Vander Plaats, who together have been a road show for Cruz during his visits here over the past two months. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Their endorsements coincided with Cruz's first major surge in Iowa surveys, culminating with Cruz taking the lead in a Des Moines Register poll in mid-December. With King, he had a provocative spokesperson and a validator in the intense boxing match with the ethanol lobby. With Vander Plaats, he had a networker who could stick around to win over the weary (\"It's not that we dislike Santorum,\" he told one voter on the way out the door Saturday.)</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Cruz, who had worked hard to tamper expectations, had inadvertently raised them.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"You see the poll?\" Jeff King, the congressman's son, who leads the Cruz super PAC operation here in Iowa, remembers saying to another group official then. \"We're going to have to do well in Iowa.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Cruz's wager on Iowa stood in contrast to his closest rivals: Trump and Rubio, both of whom are expected to do better in New Hampshire than the Texas senator.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"When he started this thing, he was nowhere,\" said GOP pollster Frank Luntz, standing on a chair as an overflow Cruz crowd surrounded him in Ames. \"I would use this campaign to teach others how to run a race.\" </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Monday morning, the Texan's campaign bus ambled to a basketball court in this Greene County town along the Raccoon River to pay heed to Iowa's most revered custom: the \"Full Grassley,\" or the pledge to visit all 99 counties, named for Sen. Chuck Grassley.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"Whatever campaign techniques were used by the campaign that has won, maybe this was the year for that,\" said Jeff Kaufmann, the state's GOP chair. \"But I don't think retail politics, building a political machine and doing all 99 counties is every going to be out of date in this state.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Trump spent a total of two nights in Iowa hotels, jetting in and out on a private plane for a rally every few days. Rubio blanketed the state in television ads, seeing campaign events as not as efficient a use of time as a Fox News hit or a super PAC media buy. Cruz aides stress that they layered a serious data and paid media campaign onto the infrastructure, but the bedrock of Cruz's bid here was a strategy that was more timeworn than innovative.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Visiting every corner of Iowa doesn't guarantee anything, however. Mick Huckabee and Rick Santorum, who won the 2008 and 2012 GOP caucuses, respectively, barnstormed the state and came away at the bottom of the pack. Huckabee dropped out before the night was over.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"It will say as much about the process as it does about the outcome,\" said Joseph McReynolds, a Cruz fundraiser and activist, as he observed his candidate work a tiny town two days before voting.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Up to the final hours in Iowa, Cruz's team maintained a sense of serenity, believing that the outcome's fate was largely out of their hands. Their voters would turn out. The big question that would decide the race was whether Trump's would -- and that was not in the Cruz campaign's control. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">There was considerable worry among Cruz allies and donors that their candidate made the same mistake that bedeviled previous Iowa losers: that he peaked too early. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Cruz began a slow rise in Iowa polls in mid-October, but by the time he topped them in early January, he had invited the scorn of as many as seven outside groups, and nearly every candidate, including Trump, who was raising scornful questions about Cruz's eligibility to be president.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">In addition to Trump's intense trolling and prodding in television interviews, Twitter and other free media, Cruz's campaign estimates that the senator was pummeled by $8 million in attack ads last month.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">And some allies and donors concede that those weeks -- rather than days -- on defense took its toll, including concerns pushed by the state's ethanol lobby, who led voters to badger Cruz at nearly every town hall in the homestretch of the Iowa campaign. Supporters differ on the number of points shaved by the ethanol offensive, but they admit it broke through.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Some friends, in retrospect, say the campaign could have been more aggressive toward Trump and earlier. Yet most argue that avoiding Trump's scorn was the closest thing the campaign had to a masterstroke -- nearly every candidate who attacked Trump, of course, crashed.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">It was a calculation they never thought they'd have to make. Cruz's win involved a fair amount of luck: Many of the candidates once likely to be top rivals here -- whether it was Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker or Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky -- fizzled entirely. When asked in June about the candidate competing with him most prominently in the evangelical lane, Cruz pointed to a candidate who ended up flirting with invisibility and dropped out Monday night: Mike Huckabee. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">In the final moments, an old threat reappeared: Rubio. Trump had pulled away in some early polls, and Rubio began to inch up in some public polls. Cruz's super PACs, both weary Rubio's rise but also seeing his supporters as soft, began to target him aggressively. The campaign reassigned all of its advertising in the final days to hold off Rubio, once a vanquished opponent, instead.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">John Thompson, an unaligned Iowa GOP central committee member, said Cruz undoubtedly faded in the final weeks here. But the fundamentals of Cruz's bid, he said, charted a new Iowa path.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"He took the best out of every textbook that's ever been written,\" Thompson said, \"and I think he made a new game.\"</p>"], "article_highlights": ["Ted Cruz won the Iowa caucuses, outpacing Donald Trump and Marco Rubio", "He laid the groundwork early, as far back as 2013"], "article_author": ["Theodore Schleifer"]}

Choose your ordeal"], "article_timestamp": ["Updated 11:11 AM ET, Mon February 1, 2016 "], "article_edsource": [], "article_url": ["http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/31/opinions/iowa-caucus-ikea-couch-brazile/index.html"], "article_content": ["<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Traditionalists rely on their volunteers, data from previous caucus nights to reach traditional voters, phone banks to reach reliable partisans, celebrities to encourage new voters and surrogates to inspire the undecided.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Most of the time, candidates use activists who are respected in their communities to stand up and persuade voters to back their candidate. And that's never easy because voters often come to caucus still deciding among the candidates. We might be in for a long night on both sides if first-time voters or independents decide to caucus with the Democrats or the Republicans. Their inexperience and indecision may slow down the process. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\"><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/30/politics/iowa-road-trip-caucus-takeaways-king/\">6 keys to the Iowa caucuses</a></p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">One top field operative who has organized multiple times in Iowa reminded me in an email that \"good field (operation) beats poor field badly in a close race.\"  My own experience -- two Iowa caucuses on the ground ('84 and '88) plus a third if you count my 2000 role, and one New Hampshire primary on the ground ('88) -- confirmed and reconfirmed to me that in the closing days, it comes down to the ground game.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">So where do we stand? It's hard to predict without knowing who will show up. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Traditionally, Iowans wait to the last minute to decide whether they will attend their caucus. Weather is always a factor, especially in rural areas where volunteers are needed to pick up seniors and those without transportation.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Republicans have to reckon with a little more chaos come caucus night. Businessman Donald Trump has run a serious race. If Trump supporters, who continue to fill up stadiums, concert venues and other facilities, come out in Iowa, one of my colleagues remarked that \"the establishment can try, but I don't think he can be stopped.  On the other hand, if the new people he needs do not show up, I would not count out Rubio having a surprisingly strong finish in Iowa.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Further, as one Democratic strategist put it, \"any normal year -- Mike Huckabee (winning Iowa) in 2008 and Rick Santorum 2012 -- should mean Ted Cruz in 2016 -- but is it a normal year?  Hasn't been so far.\" I agree.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">On the Democratic  side, a very close race is possible given the demographics of the state. Iowa is 92% white. That's not much of a factor for the Republicans as the GOP itself is 89% white. But as my old colleague Joe Trippi pointed out, for Democrats, \"whoever wins Iowa has to prove they can win in a much more diverse electorate like South Carolina to have any real chance at representing the party -- that's what Barack Obama did in 2008.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Expect Sanders to do well in college towns and some rural areas. Clinton has been down this road before, so her team is experienced and knows how to get out her supporters. If O'Malley voters don't reach the threshold of 15% to obtain delegates, they can caucus with the supporters of the other two candidates or try to form an uncommitted slate. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">If you do indeed get three tickets out of Iowa, nobody is happier about that than Martin O'Malley.  He gets to fly into New Hampshire regardless of the outcome. But if there are just three tickets out of Iowa for the Republicans, then with Trump and Cruz doing well, there is really only one ticket out of Iowa for the Republican establishment candidate. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">At the end of the night, be sure to remember it's all about the number of delegates each candidate won -- so far. After Iowa, New Hampshire is just a little over a week away. That's great news for the media, political junkies and anyone who didn't win in Iowa.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/CNNOpinion\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.</em></a><a href=\"https://flipboard.com/@cnn/voices-9mpbd5vly\" target=\"_blank\"><em><br>Read CNNOpinion's Flipboard magazine.</em>\u2003</a></p>"], "article_highlights": ["Voting in a caucus is a whole lot harder than in a primary, says Donna Brazile", "Iowa often narrows the field to no more than three candidates in each party, she writes"], "article_author": ["Donna Brazile"]}

As CNN's Brian Stelter noted Sunday on his show \"Reliable Sources,\" the group Reporters Without Borders, which typically focuses on freedom of the press issues under dictatorships, has expressed a growing concern over Trump's actions. The group noted, for example, that <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2016/01/29/media/donald-trump-journalists-presidential-candidates/\" target=\"_blank\">Trump's personal attacks on journalists</a> and his revoking of press credentials for media outlets that he believes are too critical are \"extremely dangerous\" for \"freedom of the press.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">But are we all overreacting? Is this just all part of the rough and tumble of the campaign? Are we blowing Trump's rhetoric out of proportion? The simple answer: no. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">During this campaign, Trump has served up a cocktail of extreme language that goes from alarming to chilling.  A few examples: his claim that Mexico is <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/06/25/politics/donald-trump-mexicans-terrorists-immigration-2016/\">sending \"rapists\" to America</a>, his mocking of a disabled reporter and his numerous sexist comments, the most recent being his tweet last week <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/25/politics/donald-trump-megyn-kelly-tweets/\">calling Megyn Kelly a \"bimbo.\" </a></p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Remember that this isn't just talk taking place in a vacuum; Trump's words have real world consequences, emboldening people with extreme views and sometimes inspiring them to act. After Trump called Kelly a bimbo, there were reportedly more than<a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/trump-calls-fox-news-anchor-megyn-kelly-bimbo-article-1.2512993\" target=\"_blank\"> 80,000 tweets directed at the Fox News host,</a> many of them containing sexist slurs. And in August, two Trump supporters allegedly beat up a Latino homeless man in Boston, telling the police, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/20/politics/donald-trump-immigration-boston-beating/\" target=\"_blank\">\"Donald Trump was right. All these illegals need to be deported.\"</a></p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">But the story that stands out to me as the most disturbing was from November, in Birmingham, Alabama, when a black protester interrupted Trump several times. Trump bellowed to the crowd to \"Get him out of here!\"  On command, the Trump supporters <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/11/22/black-activist-punched-at-donald-trump-rally-in-birmingham/\" target=\"_blank\">appeared to assault the man</a>, with some allegedly<a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2015/11/23/3725051/trump-protester-beaten/\" target=\"_blank\"> calling him a \"monkey\" and the \"n-word.\"</a></p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Even more shocking was Trump's response the next day when asked about the incident: <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/22/politics/donald-trump-black-lives-matter-protester-confrontation/\">\"Maybe he should have been roughed up</a>, because it was absolutely disgusting what he was doing.\" </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">What does it say about a presidential candidate that he would defend his supporters assaulting a person simply for interrupting him?  </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Such incidents raise the specter of a country whose civil liberties would be under siege under a Trump presidency. After all, Trump has refused to rule out <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/donald-trump-supports-creating-database-u-s-muslims-article-1.2441178\" target=\"_blank\">warrantless surveillance of Muslim Americans</a> simply because of their religion. Trump is effectively telling us that he would like to suspend the U.S. Constitution in support of his agenda.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">It is also important to remember that this is not just about the rights of American Muslims. What about the civil liberties of Latino Americans when he sends out his<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/11/politics/donald-trump-deportation-force-debate-immigration/\"> \"deportation force\"</a> to round up the 11 million undocumented immigrants, as he has vowed?  Or gay Americans, after Trump told Fox News on Sunday that he would \"strongly consider\" <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/01/trump-suggests-overturning-same-sex-marriage.html\" target=\"_blank\">appointing Supreme Court justices to overturn marriage equality</a>?</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Waiting for the day the court overturns the decision to legalize gay marriage, would Trump sit idly by, or would he use the powers of his office to make life more difficult for gay couples?</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Of course, there are some who will tell you that Trump is just playing a political game, that he doesn't really mean what he is saying and that he will be less extreme if elected president.  But isn't that a big risk to take? Wouldn't it be safer to assume that Trump actually means what he's saying and that his actions as a candidate are indicative of what he would do if he won the White House? </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">If you think that the American presidency is too important a job to take a chance that a candidate doesn't actually mean anything he says, then it is difficult to think of three more frightening words than these: President Donald Trump.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/CNNOpinion\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.</em></a><a href=\"https://flipboard.com/@cnn/voices-9mpbd5vly\" target=\"_blank\"><em><br>Read CNNOpinion's Flipboard magazine.</em>\u2003</a></p>"], "article_highlights": ["The Iowa caucus takes place Monday night", "Dean Obeidallah: Trump's words have real-world consequences"], "article_author": ["Dean Obeidallah"]}

Others just go with a candidate's name on a scrap of paper. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Raw totals of votes are tallied by local party officials and sent to Iowa GOP headquarters, where a running count is kept.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\"><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/21/politics/donald-trump-ted-cruz-ground-game-iowa/\">READ: Can Donald Trump rewrite the rules in Iowa?</a></p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The Democratic caucus system is a little more intricate.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">As soon as the meetings open, attendees must declare a preference for a candidate.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Typically, backers of each presidential hopeful physically stake out positions around the room. People who still can't make up their mind join a group known as \"uncommitted.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">This is where it gets complicated. In order to be considered \"viable,\" a group must clear a certain threshold -- usually around 15% of the entire caucus turnout in each precinct.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Once first-round votes are tallied, anyone stuck in a group that is not \"viable\" has the chance to align with a candidate who has passed the threshold.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\"><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/25/politics/democratic-town-hall-highlights/\">READ: Sanders, Clinton show some fight in Iowa</a></p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">This year it's likely that supporters of Martin O' Malley, scraping along at low single-digits in the polls, will struggle at many caucus meetings to form a \"viable\" coalition.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The former Maryland governor thinks differently, saying at a CNN town hall Monday night that \"my message to the O'Malley supporters across this state is this: Hold strong at your caucus.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">But it's one of the cruel realities of the caucuses that if the O'Malley pack is too small, all the determination in the world won't be enough, and his supporters will have to decide whether to join backers of either former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton or Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders during a second count -- known as a \"re-alignment period.\" </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">No. A controversial aspect of the Democratic caucuses is the lack of a secret ballot.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">That means people will have to live with the vote they cast in front of their friends and neighbors for the next four years. And the faint of heart may be susceptible to pressure from more vociferous contemporaries.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Thus, a candidate who wins the first round of a caucus is not home safe. They can still end up losing if their supporters fail to win over backers of candidates eliminated for not passing the threshold and instead see that support go elsewhere -- one reason why the organization and training of precinct captains is so crucial for campaigns.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">It's also why the second choices of voters for a presidential candidate are so important in the Democratic caucuses.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Once the final count is completed, local officials work out how many delegates from a precinct each candidate gets to send the local county convention, the next step in a process that will end at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia in July.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">For some voters, it's all too much trouble. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">So the actual electorate in the caucuses is only a fraction of the tallies of registered Democrats and Republicans who will vote in the fall. That's one reason why you often hear complaints that the caucuses are hardly the most democratic process -- especially given the state's disproportionate influence on the presidential race.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Generally, caucus participation has been around 20% of registered voters in each party in recent election cycles.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">In 2004, for example, there were half a million registered Democrats in Iowa, but only 124,000 or so showed up on caucus night, according to the Iowa Caucus Project at Drake University.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">In 2012, there were 614,000 registered Hawkeye Republicans but only 121,000 made it out on caucus night.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The exception to the rule was in 2008 during the electrifying race between Clinton and then-Illinois Sen. Barack Obama -- who made good on a vow to turn out new voters. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">A stunning 239,872 Democrats flocked to take part  -- a figure equivalent to nearly 40% of the party's registered voters. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Both Republican real estate developer Donald Trump and Sanders dream of such a showing on Monday night.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The Vermont senator, however, warned Tuesday that he'd probably not match the Obama surge.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"Frankly, I don't think we can. What Obama did in 2008 is extraordinary,\" Sanders said.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Another wrinkle that angers critics is the way independents are shut out: Only registered Democrats or Republicans can take part. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">In theory, people who have not previously registered to vote can arrive at a caucus site and do so. And it is possible to switch party affiliation on the night. But the system is still criticized for keeping out more moderate voters and often leads to a perception that only the most committed, radical voters show up.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">There were frequent veiled whispers from the Clinton campaign in 2008 that the system unfairly helped Obama, who ran to the former New York senator's left.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Clinton was still simmering in 2012 when she told her friend Sidney Blumenthal in a recently released email that the caucuses were \"creatures of the parties' extremes.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The final tabulated results will be declared by the Democratic and Republican Parties. It could all be wrapped up between about 11 p.m. ET and midnight. But soon after the caucus doors close, it should be possible for CNN to report on where the race is heading and begin the process of projecting a winner and estimating the delegate count.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Iowa officials will be hoping that there will no repeat of the debacle in 2012. On that night, Mitt Romney was declared the winner by only eight votes over former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, who is running again this year. But a certified tally issued a few weeks later found Santorum had won by 34 votes. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">By then it was too late: Santorum had been deprived of the momentum an Iowa caucus win brings. Romney was on a roll and had won New Hampshire, en route to the GOP nomination.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\"><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/apps\">Put the CNN election center to work on your device. Get the CNN app.</a></p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The elevated level of commitment demanded of caucus-goers is one reason why the vote is so tough to forecast -- no one can tell exactly who is going to show up.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">This time around, for instance, the hopes of Sanders and Trump rely on their neophyte political operations turning out thousands of new voters who have never attended caucus meetings in the past.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The turnout riddle could give early pointers as to how things will go on Monday night.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">If there are early reports of Iowans flocking to caucus sites in unusually high numbers, there's a good chance it will be a happy night for Sanders and Trump. If not, look for Clinton and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz to be firing up the victory party.</p>"], "article_highlights": ["Caucus meetings for Iowa Democrats and Republicans begin at 7 p.m. Central Time", "The electorate in the caucuses is only a fraction of the Democrats and Republicans who will vote in the fall"], "article_author": ["Stephen Collinson"]}

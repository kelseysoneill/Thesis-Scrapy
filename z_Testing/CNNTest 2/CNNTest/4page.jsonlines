The new infusion runs the super PAC's overall investment in the New Hampshire market to $6.5 million, dating back to July.", "According to a memo from the super PAC's leadership, obtained by CNN, the buy is part of a larger strategy that hinges raising Kasich's profile and on winning the race within the race.", "A September CNN/ORC poll found 51% of voters nationwide are unsure what they think of Kasich.", "Written by executive director Matt Carle and chief strategist Matt David, the three-page document outlines a game plan that revolves around contrasting Kasich's fire with Bush's failed attempt to derail Trump, and the Ohio governor's record with the comparatively thin list of Rubio's accomplishments.", "\"Most of the candidates running are just speechmakers,\" Connie Wehrkamp, a spokesman for New Day for America told CNN, \"and we highlighted some of them in this ad.\"", "Rubio has been criticized in recent days by other Republicans for his voting record. The Florida senator has insisted votes on some issues matter less than others and that his absences from the Senate are excusable because he's running for president.

Kasich pounced, and said the hunt for damning information was evidence the Bush campaign was \"getting nervous.\"", "But now Kasich's super PAC seems to be following in the footsteps of their Bush rivals. In the memo, the group's runners reveal they have now acquired a \"500-page opposition research book\" on the former Florida governor.", "The super PAC ad released by Kasich backers, notably, does not show Bush."]}

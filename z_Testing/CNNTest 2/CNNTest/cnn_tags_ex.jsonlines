"article_content": ["<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The entrance polls also showed that two-thirds of voters in the Republican race said they were born again or evangelical Christians, higher than the equivalent share in 2012. Ted Cruz had expected to run up support among the bloc, but the polls suggested its vote was being shared almost equally between the Texas senator, Donald Trump and Marco Rubio.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Cruz won the most support of Republicans who said they were looking for a candidate \"who shares their values,\" Rubio won the support of attendees who were looking for a candidate who can win the White House and Trump won among Republicans looking for a change and attendees looking for someone \"who tells it like it is.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">On the question of who should carry on President Barack Obama's legacy, Clinton won among roughly two-thirds of respondents. But Sanders won among roughly three-quarters of those who said they were looking for a more liberal successor.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The Iowa caucuses have often served as predictors of broader trends throughout each presidential cycle and beyond giving one candidate or another much-vaunted momentum, have also exposed underlying moods and feelings among voters, some of which were not immediately clear in horse-race polling. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\"><a href=\"http://nbcpolitics.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/01/04/9935735-what-the-entrance-poll-told-us-about-iowas-outcome?lite\" target=\"_blank\">Four years ago in Iowa</a>, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum edged his way past eventual nominee Mitt Romney with the help of Republicans who identified as \"very conservative\" and evangelicals. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">But Santorum also was the beneficiary of a dynamic somewhat unique to 2012 -- Republicans who went shopping for alternatives to the one clear establishment pick (Romney) and sampled a number of alternatives, including former Rep. Michele Bachmann and former Godfather's Pizza CEO Herman Cain, without truly settling on one. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">In 2008, Iowa caucus attendees gave the first hint that a first-term senator from Illinois -- now-President Barack Obama -- may be on his way to upsetting Hillary Clinton, long the front-runner in that primary battle up until then.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\"><a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/graphic/2008/01/04/GR2008010400823.html\" target=\"_blank\">According to 2008 entrance polls</a>, Obama dominated among first-time attendees, caucusgoers under the age of 60 and independents -- while registered Democrats split their support evenly between Obama, Clinton and former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\"> </p>"],

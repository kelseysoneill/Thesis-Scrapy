Bernie Sanders, but former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was winning a similar amount of support from older voters.", "On the question of who should carry on President Barack Obama's legacy, Clinton won among roughly two-thirds of respondents. But Sanders won among roughly three-quarters of those who said they were looking for a more liberal successor.", ", former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum edged his way past eventual nominee Mitt Romney with the help of Republicans who identified as \"very conservative\" and evangelicals. ", "But Santorum also was the beneficiary of a dynamic somewhat unique to 2012 -- Republicans who went shopping for alternatives to the one clear establishment pick (Romney) and sampled a number of alternatives, including former Rep. Michele Bachmann and former Godfather's Pizza CEO Herman Cain, without truly settling on one. ", "In 2008, Iowa caucus attendees gave the first hint that a first-term senator from Illinois -- now-President Barack Obama -- may be on his way to upsetting Hillary Clinton, long the front-runner in that primary battle up until then.", ", Obama dominated among first-time attendees, caucusgoers under the age of 60 and independents -- while registered Democrats split their support evenly between Obama, Clinton and former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards. ", " "], "article_highlights": []}

I don't think Americans want to turn the clock back on the rights that have been gained.\" ", "She added, \"I think that the mood of the country is, of course, wanting to move forward. ...  I think I offer a very clear understanding of what we have to do and how to get it done.\"", "Clinton has made that argument on the stump across Iowa, casting herself as the candidate most prepared to build on President Barack Obama's legacy. Obama's first secretary of state, however, deflected a question about whether she feels she has the President's support.", "\"We became close partners and real friends, and I have a high level of commitment to see his accomplishments get recognized,\" Clinton said. \"And I will stand up to Republican attacks against him personally and his record.

I take classified information really seriously,\" she continued. \"If the Republicans want to use this for political purposes, that's their decision, but I'm going to keep talking about what the voters in Iowa keep talking to me about.\" "],

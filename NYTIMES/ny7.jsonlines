Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, who dropped out of the race at the end of the night, and ahead of only Rick Santorum and Jim Gilmore.", "Those results make New Hampshire, with its primary next Tuesday, essentially a make-or-break state for Mr. Christie, a point that was visible as he embarked on a schedule on Tuesday of five public events, from Nashua to Bedford to Manchester.", "As he spoke to the Salvation Army, he noted that it was his 67th day in New Hampshire \u2013 which he said was more than any other candidate \u2013 and he called it \u201cthe emphasis of our campaign.\u201d", "Still, he offered his opinion of the Iowa results, saying he was \u201cnot very surprised\u201d with the pecking order of Ted Cruz-Donald Trump-Marco Rubio.", "Mr. Christie said Mr. Cruz, the Texas senator, needed to win Iowa \u2014 and did. And he said did not expect a victory for Mr. Trump, saying that after meeting with Iowans he did not believe they were \u201call of a sudden going to vote for a billionaire real estate developer.\u201d", "\u201cBad morning for Donald,\u201d he said.", "When it came to Mr. Rubio\u2019s performance, Mr. Christie said he was in his hotel room on Monday night watching the Florida senator\u2019s speech, and from his tone, Mr. Christie thought that he had come out ahead.", "\u201cI\u2019m like, hey, did Marco win?\u201d Mr. Christie said. \u201cNo, he came in third!\u201d", "Mr. Christie\u2019s analysis even extended to the Democratic side. He called the night a good one for Hillary Clinton, and a setback for Bernie Sanders. Iowa\u2019s demographics made it a winnable state and a missed opportunity for Mr. Sanders, he said.", "The Vermont senator is expected to do well in New Hampshire, where voters are familiar with him, but nonetheless, Mr. Christie said, \u201cIf he can\u2019t win in Iowa, where else is he going to win?\u201d ", "John H. Sununu, the former governor of New Hampshire who has been voicing increasing concern about what a Donald J. Trump victory in his state would mean for his party, twisted the knife after the billionaire\u2019s second-place finish in the Iowa caucuses on Tuesday morning \u2014 and offered a preview of the attacks he is about to face.", "\u201cThere were two winners last night \u2014 one was Cruz, and one was Rubio \u2014 and there was one loser last night, that was Trump,\u201d Mr. Sununu, the New Hampshire governor in the 1980s who later served ", "as White House chief of staff", " under President George Bush, said in a telephone interview.", "Senator Ted Cruz of Texas came in first in the Republican caucuses, with Mr. Trump four percentage points behind him. Mr. Rubio was one percentage point behind Mr. Trump.", "\u201cIn New Hampshire,\u201d Mr. Sununu, 76, said of the primary, which will be next Tuesday, \u201cI still think about half the voters are undecided or prepared to change their mind. I think Trump\u2019s loss will remind people that the guy has a history of losses.\u201d", "From there, he appeared to read off line items from an opposition research file, talking about Mr. Trump\u2019s bankruptcies in his business and the difficulties encountered by Trump University.", "\u201cThere is no longer Trump Vodka,\u201d Mr. Sununu continued, also mentioning \u201cTrump fragrances\u201d and \u201cthree magazines that Mr. Trump put his name on.\u201d", "Mr. Trump has repeatedly denounced Mr. Sununu\u2019s criticism. But the line of attack, aimed squarely at Mr. Trump\u2019s business history, is a fresh provocation as the candidate heads into a state where his lead in polls was in double digits just before the Iowa caucuses, and where he will need a victory to propel him toward the Republican nomination.", "A spokeswoman for Mr. Trump did not respond to an email seeking comment. Mr. Trump, who is normally a visible Twitter user and a frequent guest by phone on the morning TV programs after major events, was silent on Twitter for about 15 hours. Late Tuesday morning he finally posted:", "\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) ", "February 2, 2016", "\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) ", "February 2, 2016", "So that was interesting. ", "Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont fought Hillary Clinton to a tie, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida polished his bronze medal and turned a would-be concession speech into a victory lap, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas marched to victory, and Donald J. Trump was faced with a loss he had to explain in the Iowa caucuses on Monday night. ", "Let\u2019s start with the most unanticipated result. Mrs. Clinton had seemed a clear winner in the last Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics, and her team felt confident of victory heading into the night. But Mr. Sanders\u2019s vote share was surprising to say the least and created the thing Mrs. Clinton least enjoys in her races \u2014 the element of surprise. Mrs. Clinton, who is behind in New Hampshire, now needs to fare well in the Nevada caucuses this month. And Mr. Sanders, who has already raised tens of millions of dollars with his populist message, seems newly energized and ready for a long fight.", "As for the Republicans, Mr. Cruz\u2019s victory validated his campaign\u2019s internal predictions. Mr. Rubio outperformed his poll numbers and heads into New Hampshire with a potential bounce. He shrewdly gave his speech before either Mr. Cruz or Mr. Trump, and offered essentially a version of the \u201ccomeback kid\u201d speech from Bill Clinton\u2019s second-place finish in New Hampshire in 1992. ", "Mr. Cruz emerges as the strong favorite for anti-establishment voters and conservatives. Mr. Rubio potentially overtakes Mr. Trump and becomes the establishment\u2019s best chance to stop Mr. Cruz, who now heads into New Hampshire having defied late predictions that he would lose in Iowa. But Mr. Trump\u2019s deeply negative attacks on Mr. Cruz, raising questions about his citizenship, appear to have backfired. ", "Mr. Trump handled his second-place finish stoically, thanking Iowans and insisting he loved the state. But though the polls were wrong to show him winning, he couldn\u2019t shake his reliance on public surveys, noting that one in New Hampshire shows him up by 28 points. But that was conducted before the Iowa caucuses. There are several candidates vying for support in New Hampshire who are strong fits for the state, and Mr. Trump will face fresh pressure to show he can compete.", "What might save Mr. Trump, ironically, is the mess on the Democratic side. Instead of wall-to-wall coverage about his loss, the focus will largely be on Mr. Sanders\u2019s strong showing, giving Mr. Trump additional time to adjust. And then there\u2019s the ever-present question of whether Mr. Trump does something dramatic to regain the attention.", "\n", "Campaign aides for Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont said Monday night that the Democratic Party did not collect the results of 90 Iowa precincts, which is about 5 percent of all votes cast in the state, because the party had failed to properly staff the precincts.", "Rania Batrice, a spokeswoman for the campaign based in Iowa, said that the party reached out to the campaigns of Mr. Sanders and Hillary Clinton and asked them to help tally the results. \u201cIt\u2019s just offensive that they dropped the ball like this,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d", "Monday night it was unclear how the issue would be resolved. ", "Ms. Batrice said the party was supposed to properly staff all precincts with caucus chairs but that some of those people responsible for calculating the results did not shown up.", "The Democratic Party pushed back against reports that the caucus sites were not staffed appropriately.", "\u201cWe are currently getting results from our small number of outstanding precincts, and results continue to be reported on our public website,\u201d the party said in statement. \u201cThese outstanding precincts have chairs who we are in the process of contacting to get their results. It is inaccurate to report that these precincts did not have chairs.\u201d ", "The party said that it was seeking help from the campaigns in contacting their precinct chairs."]}

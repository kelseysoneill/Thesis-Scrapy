Trump stormed out in a rage at Fox News, jeopardizing the network\u2019s ratings and overtaking political headlines.", "But the reasons for his withdrawal from the kind of high-profile forum that he has so often dominated may involve more than just hurt feelings.", "What may be the most intriguing possible explanation is that a debate, at this point in his neck-and-neck contest with Senator Ted Cruz, would almost certainly subject Mr. Trump to tough questions about vulnerabilities \u2013 like his previous support for abortion rights, or his much more recent suggestion that Iowans, the people whose votes he is courting, are stupid.", "People who have spoken with Mr. Trump insist he believes he is headed to victory here and wants to play out the clock, a view that was bolstered by a few public opinion polls this week.", "But whether he does or not, a debate \u2013 particularly one moderated by a network, and an anchor, whom Mr. Trump believes is motivated to challenge him aggressively \u2013 amounts to an uncontrollable, high-risk confrontation whose outcome could greatly affect his chances.", "The truth could be as simple as advertised: Mr. Trump was enraged when Fox News executives issued a statement mocking him as unserious over his threats to bolt the debate unless the cable channel\u2019s anchor, Megyn Kelly \u2013 whom Mr. Trump has attacked for months \u2013 was removed as a moderator.", "It could also be seen as strategic genius. \u201cDonald Trump knows that by not showing up, he\u2019s owning the entire event,\u201d Rush Limbaugh said on his radio show. \u201cSome guy not even present will end up owning the entire event, and the proof of that is Fox News last night.\u201d", "But for Mr. Trump, participating in a debate four nights before the Iowa caucuses would also most likely mean being pelted with many of his past remarks, in a setting in which he could not expect to dominate the microphone or the questioners.", "It would be the exact opposite, for example, of the exchange between Mr. Trump and an NBC reporter who, at the same news conference Tuesday at which Mr. Trump pulled out of the debate, tried to confront him about his previous support for abortion rights, including the late-term procedure that opponents call partial-birth abortion.", "Mr. Cruz and a well-funded group supporting him have been bombarding Mr. Trump with attack ads using footage of a 1999 interview in which he called himself \u201cvery pro-choice\u201d and \u201cpro-choice in all respects.\u201d But when the NBC reporter, Peter Alexander, tried to ask Mr. Trump about that quotation, Mr. Trump repeatedly cut him off, talked over him and turned the tables on him, demanding an apology.", "Abortion is not the only subject on which Mr. Trump could be forced to defend or explain his remarks in a tough-minded presidential debate: The ads being run by Mr. Cruz, for example, also show a clip of Mr. Trump, in November, asking \u201chow stupid\u201d the people of Iowa must be for believing Ben Carson\u2019s story of personal redemption.", "Mr. Trump\u2019s debate performances debates have not always been unmitigated triumphs: While he acquitted himself well in rebutting Mr. Cruz\u2019s denigration of what he called \u201cNew York values\u201d in a Jan. 14 debate in South Carolina, for example, Mr. Cruz savaged Mr. Trump for much of the first half-hour.", "David Carney, a Republican strategist who ran Rick Perry\u2019s 2012 presidential campaign, said Mr. Trump made a wise move in pulling out of the debate when he could not count on turning in a strong performance. \u201cThe debates aren\u2019t his thing,\u201d he said, predicting it would not hurt Mr. Trump with his supporters.", "What is undeniable is that Mr. Trump does not like feeling as if he is being backed into a corner \u2013 and that the sarcastic statement by Fox News on Tuesday bothered him greatly.", "Escalating a back-and-forth with Mr. Trump leading up to the debate, the network openly mocked him for complaining when challenged by aggressive journalists. \u201cWe learned from a secret back channel that the ayatollah and Putin both intend to treat Donald Trump unfairly when they meet with him if he becomes president,\u201d the network said.", "Referring to Mr. Trump\u2019s survey of his Twitter followers as to whether he should go ahead with the debate, Fox News added: \u201cA nefarious source tells us that Trump has his own secret plan to replace the cabinet with his Twitter followers to see if he should even go to those meetings.\u201d", "At his news conference, held in a high school in Marshalltown, Iowa, Mr. Trump called the network\u2019s parody a \u201cwiseguy press release,\u201d and dared Fox News to hold the debate without him.", "\u201cNow let\u2019s see how they do with the ratings,\u201d he said.", "Fox News has steadfastly stood by Ms. Kelly. Mr. Trump\u2019s aides said they were planning a competing event in Des Moines during the debate, a fund-raiser to help wounded veterans.

But Mr. Trump\u2019s earlier brinkmanship over debates came months ago, not on the eve of a vote, when it could shape the opinions of Iowa\u2019s late-deciding caucusgoers.", "\u201cThis debate is in Iowa,\u201d noted Kellyanne Conway, a Republican strategist and the president of the main \u201csuper PAC\u201d supporting Mr. Cruz. If it were anywhere else, she said, the flap with Fox News might not add up to much. But voters here are paying attention.", "Still, exactly what they are taking away from the standoff is unclear.", "Matt Strawn, a former chairman of the Iowa Republican Party, said he saw no sign yet that it would cut into Mr. Trump\u2019s support.", "\u201cThose voters have been drawn to him because he\u2019s willing to flout\u201d establishment rules, Mr. Strawn said.", "Would the timing of the dispute make a difference? \u201cLike most of the Donald Trump experience over the last 12 months,\u201d he said, \u201cwe\u2019re all going to learn together.\u201d"], "article_author": ["Maggie Haberman"]}

Below is her complete response:", "\u201cThank you for asking that. I am a person of faith. I am a Christian. I am a Methodist. I have been raised Methodist. I feel very grateful for the instructions and support I received starting in my family but through my church, and I think that any of us who are Christian have a constantly, constant, conversation in our own heads about what we are called to do and how we are asked to do it, and I think it is absolutely appropriate for people to have very strong convictions and also, though, to discuss those with other people of faith. Because different experiences can lead to different conclusions about what is consonant with our faith and how best to exercise it.", "The idea you heard on the radio of looking at individuals, I think, is absolutely fair. My study of the Bible, my many conversations with people of faith, has led me to believe the most important commandment is to love the Lord with all your might and to love your neighbor as yourself, and that is what I think we are commanded by Christ to do, and there is so much more in the Bible about taking care of the poor, visiting the prisoners, taking in the stranger, creating opportunities for others to be lifted up, to find faith themselves that I think there are many different ways of exercising your faith. But I do believe that in many areas judgment should be left to God, that being more open, tolerant and respectful is part of what makes me humble about my faith, and I am in awe of people who truly turn the other cheek all the time, who can go that extra mile that we are called to go, who keep finding ways to forgive and move on. Those are really hard things for human beings to do, and there is a lot, certainly in the New Testament, that calls us to do that.", "The famous discussion on the Sermon on the Mount should be something that you really pay attention to. There\u2019s a lot of great Bible studies: What does the Sermon on the Mount really mean? What is it calling us to do and to understand? Because it sure does seem to favor the poor and the merciful and those who in worldly terms don\u2019t have a lot but who have the spirit that God recognizes as being at the core of love and salvation.", "So there is much to be learned and I have been very disappointed and sorry that Christianity, which has such great love at its core, is sometimes used to condemn so quickly and judge so harshly. When I think part of the message that I certainly have tried to understand and live with is to look at yourself first, to make sure you are being the kind of person you should be in how you are treating others, and I am by no means a perfect person, I will certainly confess that to one and all, but I feel the continuing urge to try to do better, to try to be kinder, to try to be more loving, even with people who are quite harsh.", "So, I think you have to keep asking yourself, if you are a person of faith, what is expected of me and am I actually acting the way that I should? And that starts in small ways and goes out in very large ones, but it\u2019s something that I take very seriously. So thank you for asking.\u201d"], "article_author": []}

But that was conducted before the Iowa caucuses. There are several candidates vying for support in New Hampshire who are strong fits for the state, and Mr. Trump will face fresh pressure to show he can compete.", "What might save Mr. Trump, ironically, is the mess on the Democratic side. Instead of wall-to-wall coverage about his loss, the focus will largely be on Mr. Sanders\u2019s strong showing, giving Mr. Trump additional time to adjust.

I feel very grateful for the instructions and support I received starting in my family but through my church, and I think that any of us who are Christian have a constantly, constant, conversation in our own heads about what we are called to do and how we are asked to do it, and I think it is absolutely appropriate for people to have very strong convictions and also, though, to discuss those with other people of faith. Because different experiences can lead to different conclusions about what is consonant with our faith and how best to exercise it.", "The idea you heard on the radio of looking at individuals, I think, is absolutely fair. My study of the Bible, my many conversations with people of faith, has led me to believe the most important commandment is to love the Lord with all your might and to love your neighbor as yourself, and that is what I think we are commanded by Christ to do, and there is so much more in the Bible about taking care of the poor, visiting the prisoners, taking in the stranger, creating opportunities for others to be lifted up, to find faith themselves that I think there are many different ways of exercising your faith. But I do believe that in many areas judgment should be left to God, that being more open, tolerant and respectful is part of what makes me humble about my faith, and I am in awe of people who truly turn the other cheek all the time, who can go that extra mile that we are called to go, who keep finding ways to forgive and move on. Those are really hard things for human beings to do, and there is a lot, certainly in the New Testament, that calls us to do that.", "The famous discussion on the Sermon on the Mount should be something that you really pay attention to. There\u2019s a lot of great Bible studies: What does the Sermon on the Mount really mean? What is it calling us to do and to understand? Because it sure does seem to favor the poor and the merciful and those who in worldly terms don\u2019t have a lot but who have the spirit that God recognizes as being at the core of love and salvation.", "So there is much to be learned and I have been very disappointed and sorry that Christianity, which has such great love at its core, is sometimes used to condemn so quickly and judge so harshly. When I think part of the message that I certainly have tried to understand and live with is to look at yourself first, to make sure you are being the kind of person you should be in how you are treating others, and I am by no means a perfect person, I will certainly confess that to one and all, but I feel the continuing urge to try to do better, to try to be kinder, to try to be more loving, even with people who are quite harsh.", "So, I think you have to keep asking yourself, if you are a person of faith, what is expected of me and am I actually acting the way that I should? And that starts in small ways and goes out in very large ones, but it\u2019s something that I take very seriously. So thank you for asking.\u201d"], "article_author": []}

The Vermont senator\u2019s hourlong speech focused on the legacy of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and on how his presidency would continue Dr. King\u2019s legacy by fighting various forms of discrimination and inequality.", "\u201cIt is absolutely imperative that we see his life not as a museum piece, something simply to be looked at, to be studied, to be appreciated, to be kept on a shelf,\u201d Mr. Sanders said of Dr. King. \u201cTo truly honor the life of Dr. King, we must fight to carry out his radical and bold vision for America. And his vision was of a nation in which we not only end all forms of institutional racism, and bigotry, but a nation in which all of us, black, and white, and Latino, Asian-American, Native American, all of us, come to together to create a country which provides economic, social and environmental justice for all.\u201d", "Mr. Sanders also spoke about other core issues of his campaign, including the need to break up big commercial banks, to reform campaign finance laws, to increase the minimum wage to $15 an hour, to invest in sustainable energy and to transform wealth distribution. He talked of recently released details about his plan to create a \u201csingle-payer Medicare for all\u201d health care system, and of his plans to use taxes on the rich to pay for progressive programs. And, riding the high of his debate performance, Mr. Sanders reminded the crowd that he is close to beating Mrs. Clinton in Iowa and New Hampshire.", "About 5,700 people were at the event at Boutwell Auditorium, and another 1,400 people outside watched it from an overflow area on large televisions.", "Earlier in the day, Mr. Sanders visited the 16th Street Baptist Church, where four black girls were killed in a bombing in 1963. \u201cThis was terrorism,\u201d he said during the tour.", "He also stopped by the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute, where he touched the bars of the Birmingham jail cell where Dr. King was held and viewed exhibits including segregated water fountains and a Ku Klux Klan robe.", "Before the event, people eager to get into the auditorium braved frigid weather and stood for more than an hour in a line that extended blocks and wrapped into a nearby parking lot. As the event\u2019s start time neared, volunteers bellowed that the space was filling up fast and was standing room only.", "\u201cThe end of the line is all the way down,\u201d a volunteer shouted to people who looked shocked at the turnout. One supporter sighed, dismayed by the wait. Another, however, cheerfully stared at the line and declared, \u201cThis gives me hope.\u201d", "Chris Echols, 41, drove about 90 miles from his home in Montgomery to see Mr. Sanders. As he stood in line, Mr. Echols said that until Sunday\u2019s debate he had been undecided about which Democratic candidate to support.", "Now, he plans to vote for Mr. Sanders. Mr. Echols also said that if Mrs. Clinton were to win the Democratic nomination and Mr. Sanders were to run as an independent, he would still vote for Mr. Sanders.", "\u201cThe biggest thing for me is health care,\u201d Mr. Echols, an audio-visual technician, said. \u201cHe finally laid out how he is going to pay for it, and he kind of stood his ground on a lot of issues. I think before now I looked at him like he was just a cranky old guy going on and on about the same things.\u201d", "As the event came to a close, Mr. Sanders said he would have to work hard to win Alabama\u2019s March 1 primary. He added that those in the crowd had harder work to do in the Southern state to garner support than he had to do in Vermont. In the end, he left them with a direct message.", "\u201cWe have got to go out to our white, working-class friends,\u201d Mr. Sanders said to the mostly white crowd. \u201cWe have got to go out to our brothers and sisters there and say stop voting against your own best interests.\u201d"], "article_author": ["Yamiche Alcindor"]}

The hotter it gets, the better the mosquito that carries Zika virus is at transmitting its buffet of dangerous illnesses, scientists say.</p>", "<p>Although it is too early to say for this outbreak, past outbreaks of similar diseases involved more than just biology. In the past, weather has played a key role, as have economics, human travel, air conditioning and mosquito control. Even El Nino sneaks into the game. Scientists say you can\u2019t just blame one thing for an outbreak and caution it is too early to link this one to climate change or any single weather event.</p>", "<p>As the temperature rises, nearly everything about the biology of the Aedes aegypti mosquito - the one that carries Zika, dengue fever and other diseases - speeds up when it comes to spreading disease, said entomologist Bill Reisen of the University of California Davis.</p>", "<p><strong><a href=\"/news/2016/feb/2/zika-virus-can-be-spread-sex-officials-now-say/\" target=\"_blank\">\n                        \n                        \n                          SEE ALSO: Zika virus can be spread by sex, officials now say\n                        \n                        </a></strong></p>", "<p>\u201cWith higher temperatures you have more mosquitoes feeding more frequently and having a greater chance of acquiring infection. And then the virus replicates faster because it\u2019s hotter, therefore the mosquitoes can transmit earlier in their life,\u201d Reisen said. The thermodynamics of mosquitoes are \u201cdriven by temperature.\u201d</p>", "<p>The hotspots for this Zika outbreak also have been temperature and drought hotspots recently. Recife, Brazil, the largest city in the Zika-struck region, saw its hottest September-October-November on record, about 1.2 degrees Celsius (2.2 degrees Fahrenheit) above normal, according to NASA data. The state of Pernambuco had its hottest and driest year since 1998, according to the state weather agency. And globally, last year was the hottest on record.</p>", "<p>Scientists have studied Zika far less than other mosquito-borne diseases, so for guidance they often look at dengue fever or chikungunya, which are transmitted by the same species of mosquito. Dengue infects as many as 400 million people a year, with a quarter of them sick enough to be hospitalized.</p>", "<p>Zika was just declared a global public health emergency after being linked to brain deformities in babies in South America. Several thousand cases of microcephaly have been reported in Brazil since October, although researchers have so far not proven a definitive link to the virus. No vaccine exists for Zika.</p>", "<p>In general, mosquitoes don\u2019t live long, maybe 10 to 12 days on average, said Tom Scott, a University of California Davis professor of both entomology and epidemiology. That\u2019s also about how long it takes a virus to grow in the mosquito gut, making the bug infectious and able to spread the disease. Often the insect will die before it can get a chance to spread the disease.</p>", "<p>Warmer air incubates the virus faster in the cold-blooded mosquito. So the insect has more time to be infectious and alive to spread the disease, Scott said.</p>", "<p>Warmer temperatures also make the mosquito hungrier, so it takes more \u201cblood meals\u201d and can spread the disease to more people, Scott, Reisen and others said. And warmer temperatures generally increase the mosquito population.</p>", "<p>Kristie Ebi, a professor of global health at the University of Washington, calls it \u201ca temperature-driven eruption.\u201d</p>", "<p>That\u2019s not the only role of weather.</p>", "<p>El Nino, a natural warming of parts of the central Pacific Ocean that changes weather worldwide, usually puts northeastern Brazil into a drought, as it did last year. Aedes aegypti does well in less-developed regions in droughts, because it lives in areas where poorer people store water in outdoor containers, said Jonathan Patz, director of the global health institute at the University of Wisconsin.</p>", "<p>\u201cAs with all mosquito-borne viruses, climate is one of many factors that influence Zika transmission,\u201d said Andy Monaghan, a scientist who works on public health impacts of climate change at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. \u201cI think it is too early to say anything about the role of climate change in the ongoing Zika outbreak.\u201d</p>", "<p>However, Monaghan earlier this year presented a paper to the American Meteorological Society\u2019s annual convention that predicts that eventually Aedes aegypti \u201cwill move northward in the U.S. due to future warming, which would expose people to the mosquito on a regular seasonal basis in states like Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, North Carolina, Virginia and D.C.\u201d</p>", "<p><a href=\"?page=2\" onclick=\"_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'Pagination', 'StoryContinues', '/news/2016/feb/3/higher-temperatures-makes-zika-mosquito-spread-dis/']);trackclick(this);\"><em>Story Continues \u2192</em></a></p>"], "article_author": []}

Both say multiple shots were fired and that <a href=\"/topics/robert-lavoy-finicum/\">Finicum</a> was attempting to surrender when he was killed by an Oregon state trooper on Highway 395 near Burns, Oregon.</p>", "<p>\u201cHe had his hands up,\u201d Ms. Sharp told CNN in a Wednesday interview. \u201cHe was shouting that if they were going to shoot, then just shoot him.

A few second later, however, he appears to reach toward his waistband or jacket as officers approach him from either side.</p>", "<p>\u201cAgents and troopers on scene had information that <a href=\"/topics/robert-lavoy-finicum/\">Finicum</a> and others would be armed,\u201d Mr. Bretzing said at last week\u2019s press briefing. \u201cOn at least two occasions, <a href=\"/topics/robert-lavoy-finicum/\">Finicum</a> reaches his right hand toward a pocket on the left inside portion of his jacket.

I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>", "<p>From a tactical perspective, he said, the video raises any number of questions, starting with the placement of the officers who appear on either side of <a href=\"/topics/robert-lavoy-finicum/\">Finicum</a> after he exits the truck, which he had plowed into a snowbank to avoid an <a href=\"/topics/federal-bureau-of-investigation/\">FBI</a> roadblock.</p>", "<p>The officers appear to be in each other\u2019s line of sight.

They\u2019re shooting at each other, so they\u2019re in the same line of sight as well, which is violation of protocol.\u201d</p>", "<p>At the same time, the decision by <a href=\"/topics/robert-lavoy-finicum/\">Finicum</a> to lower his arms and make a move toward his jacket or waistband shows that he was \u201cdefinitely non-compliant,\u201d Mr. Klinger said.</p>", "<p>\u201cNow whether that non-compliance rises to the level where deadly force was necessary \u2014 I\u2019ve looked at the thing several times, and I can\u2019t tell what the gentleman who was shot was doing with his hands, but I can guarantee you, he was not surrendering in terms of complying with the officer\u2019s orders,\u201d Mr. Klinger added.</p>", "<p>The occupiers held frequent press conferences at the refuge headquarters, which they took over Jan. 2 in a protest against federal public-lands policy.

She won 68 percent of voters over 65, compared  to 26 percent for <a href=\"/topics/bernie-sanders/\">Mr. Sanders</a>. By contrast, <a href=\"/topics/bernie-sanders/\">Mr. Sanders</a> dominated among  younger voters, capturing 84 percent of voters ages 17 to 29, compared  to just 13 percent for the former secretary of state.</p>", "<p>Nearly  three in five Democrats said they wanted to continue <a href=\"/topics/barack-obama/\">Mr. Obama</a>\u2019s  policies, and <a href=\"/topics/hillary-clinton/\">Mrs. Clinton</a> overwhelmingly won those voters.

Jim Webb  and former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee dropped out soon after the  first debate, in which they both turned in lackluster performances.</p>", "<p>Despite  low poll numbers throughout the race, <a href=\"/topics/martin-omalley/\">Mr. O'Malley</a> persevered through  the Iowa caucuses. The former Maryland governor had tried to position  himself as the progressive alternative to <a href=\"/topics/hillary-clinton/\">Mrs. Clinton</a>, but liberal  voters clearly favored <a href=\"/topics/bernie-sanders/\">Mr. Sanders</a>.</p>", "<p>Though he never  gained traction, <a href=\"/topics/martin-omalley/\">Mr. O'Malley</a> said his performance in the primary  process was beneficial both for himself and for the <a href=\"/topics/iowa-democratic-party/\">Democratic party</a>.</p>", "<p>\u201cTogether  we all stood up for working people, for new Americans, for the future  of the earth and the safety of our children. We put these issues at the  front of our party\u2019s agenda \u2014 these are the issues that serve the best  interests of our nation,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThe road has been  long, but our course has been true. A great many people have put their  time and talents into my campaign and I thank each of you from the  bottom of my heart. Whoever our nominee is, we must all hold strong,  together.\u201d</p>", "<p>Moving forward, <a href=\"/topics/bernie-sanders/\">Mr. Sanders</a> appears poised for a major win next week in New Hampshire.</p>", "<p><a href=\"/topics/bernie-sanders/\">Mr.  Sanders</a> is crushing <a href=\"/topics/hillary-clinton/\">Mrs. Clinton</a> in the polls in New Hampshire, with a  University of Massachusetts Lowell/7 News poll released Monday giving him the support of 61 percent of Democratic voters, while <a href=\"/topics/hillary-clinton/\">Mrs. Clinton</a> pulled in just 30 percent.</p>", "<p>Like  <a href=\"/topics/barack-obama/\">Mr. Obama</a> in 2008, <a href=\"/topics/bernie-sanders/\">Mr. Sanders</a> has energized young Democrats,  especially those who identify as progressives. Polls show young voters  overwhelmingly back the Vermont senator, while <a href=\"/topics/hillary-clinton/\">Mrs. Clinton</a> holds a  commanding lead among older voters.</p>", "<p>But there also are deeper  problems for <a href=\"/topics/hillary-clinton/\">Mrs. Clinton</a> and her quest for the Democratic nomination.  Surveys consistently have shown that Democrats consider <a href=\"/topics/bernie-sanders/\">Mr. Sanders</a> much  more honest and trustworthy than <a href=\"/topics/hillary-clinton/\">Mrs. Clinton</a>.</p>", "<p>The perception  of dishonesty \u2014 which the Clinton campaign has been unable to shake \u2014  has grown amid revelations classified information passed through the  private email account <a href=\"/topics/hillary-clinton/\">Mrs. Clinton</a> used while secretary of state.</p>", "<p><a href=\"/topics/hillary-clinton/\">Mrs.  Clinton</a> has tried to curry favor among Democrats by positioning herself  as the heir apparent to <a href=\"/topics/barack-obama/\">Mr. Obama</a>. She\u2019s praised the president\u2019s  actions on financial regulation, foreign policy and health care, all  while trying to position <a href=\"/topics/bernie-sanders/\">Mr. Sanders</a> as a candidate willing to tear  apart pieces of <a href=\"/topics/barack-obama/\">Mr. Obama</a>\u2019s legacy.</p>", "<p><a href=\"/topics/hillary-clinton/\">Mrs. Clinton</a> has said such  an approach is a mistake and would undo all the progress made in the  years since the Affordable Care Act \u2014 <a href=\"/topics/barack-obama/\">Mr. Obama</a>\u2019s signature domestic  achievement \u2014 became law.</p>", "<p><a href=\"/topics/bernie-sanders/\">Mr. Sanders</a> has shot back against those attacks and argues his plan would build on Obamacare, not destroy it.</p>"], "article_author": ["Valerie Richardson"]}

And few recognize its origins.</p>", "<p>When Josef Stalin was wrapping up his enemies inside the Soviet Union and its appendage, the Comintern, the world communist headquarters, he ran into an ideological problem with the minuscule American Communist Party. Stalin wanted to reconstitute the U.S. party with his own hacks. But as happens among communists \u2014 as recently as today in Beijing \u2014 Stalin needed a \u201ctheoretical\u201d issue to justify his actions. He seized on a heresy rampant inside the hugely unsuccessful 1930s American left: namely, the belief that, without Europes ancient class structures and conflicts, the breathtaking exuberance for life and opportunities on this side of the Atlantic would block Marxist apparatchiks from bringing on \u201cthe revolution.\u201d That was the climactic event Kremlin leadership (even if Stalinists were themselves increasingly skeptical) preached would solve the worlds problems.</p>", "<p>The then-American representative to \u201cThe Socialist Motherland,\u201d Jay Lovestone, called it \u201cAmerican exceptionalism\u201d in party councils, an unpardonable sin.</p>", "<p>Lovestone, an old American revolutionary despite his ideological transgressions, escaped Stalins goons. But it was by a hairs breadth, with help from a fellow American Communist then in Moscow, Dr. Julius Hammer, New York City physician, abortionist, ex-convict and good friend of Lenin. Hammer would go on to found a dynasty of billionaires prospering from their Moscow connections through the long line of Soviet dictators.</p>", "<p>Lovestone blossomed into an exceedingly effective anti-communist, first with the World War II Office of Strategic Services, later transformed into the CIA. Then working as international director for George Meany, the old plumber who headed the AFL-CIO, Lovestone helped bring much of the European left into the anti-Soviet fold.</p>", "<p>American exceptionalism, as clever slogans are wont, metamorphosed over the decades. It has melded with the beliefs of religious reformers who originated some American Colonies, including the Pilgrims, Oona Anne Hathaway, William Penn and Lord George Baltimore. They saw themselves as precursors of a new social order. Their phraseology often borrowed from Judeo-Christian thought, specifically the Sermon on the Mount: \u201cYou are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden.\u201d</p>", "<p>Later, the founders of the American republic believed they were creating a new civilization on the western shores of the Atlantic, distinct from Europes old evils. When asked by a passer-by the result of the secret conclave of the Philadelphia Constitutional Convention, Benjamin Franklin, the grand old wizard of the American Revolution, told her, \u201cWe have created a republic, Madame, if you can keep it.\u201d</p>", "<p>The latest to use the concept, if not the slogan itself, was Ronald Reagan, who in his 1989 farewell speech explained:</p>", "<p>\u201cI\u2019ve spoken of the shining city all my political life, but I don\u2019t know if I ever quite communicated what I saw when I said it. But in my mind it was a tall, proud city built on rocks stronger than oceans, wind-swept, God-blessed, and teeming with people of all kinds living in harmony and peace, a city with free ports that hummed with commerce and creativity, and if there had to be city walls, the walls had doors and the doors were open to anyone with the will and the heart to get here. That\u2019s how I saw it and see it still.\u201d</p>", "<p>This theme divides the nations polity today as perhaps no other intellectual current. Much of the self-anointed, sophisticated \u201cpolitical class\u201d denigrates the whole idea. President Obama, for example, recently said in France he believed in American exceptionalism only as a rationalization every nation-state has for the importance of its own credo. Many in his most loyal political base have long argued American exceptionalism camouflages rampant chauvinism, xenophobia, arbitrary use of power for self-interest \u2014 even opportunism and greed.</p>", "<p>That line of attack was enhanced when, in the aftermath of World War II, American exceptionalism took on a new meaning. With a Europe in ruins and even in recovery dependent on the U.S. defense umbrella to prevent Soviet domination, Americas economic aid was overwhelming. Its support consisted not only of brute strength but of the ability to set enduring patterns for economic development and world order. Official U.S. aid and private investment outflows created the norm for industrial countries international relations. American-style multinationals quickly superseded old European trading companies, themselves the outgrowths of European colonialism. The dollar became the international currency in which most values were expressed.</p>", "<p>Battered and tarnished as the current U.S. economy may be, when the European Union attempted to deal with this springs \u201cGreek crisis\u201d \u2014 which could lead to the destruction not only of the euro but of \u201cthe European project\u201d itself \u2014 the EU begged for help from the International Monetary Fund. There, indirectly, the American taxpayer carries a disproportionate load \u2014 more evidence of Americas still special role in world affairs.</p>", "<p>American exceptionalism lives!</p>", "<p>\u2022 <em>Sol Sanders, veteran foreign correspondent and analyst, writes weekly on the convergence of international politics, business and economics.

That is outrageous,\u201d Mrs. Fiorina said.</p>", "<p>Mr. Santorum and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee are the last two winners of the Iowa caucuses, but they have struggled to gain traction this year. Both of them blamed the press for denying them attention in the crowded field.</p>", "<p>Mr. Huckabee said he set a caucus record for most votes in 2008 and asked Iowa voters to give him another boost.</p>", "<p>\u201cYou trusted me, you believed I had your best interests at heart,\u201d he said.<br>Making a presidential debate stage for the first time was former Virginia Gov.

The candidates warned of dire risks to national security if a Democrat is elected to succeed Obama and challenged claims of recent economic gains.</p>", "<p>Heated exchanges between Trump and Cruz dominated much of the debate, with the real estate mogul saying the senator has a \u201cbig question mark\u201d hanging over his candidacy given his birth in Canada to an American mother.</p>", "<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do that to the party,\u201d Trump declared.</p>", "<p>Cruz suggested Trump was only turning on him because he\u2019s challenging Trump\u2019s lead, particularly in Iowa, which kicks off voting on Feb. 1.</p>", "<p>Cruz renewed his criticism of Trump\u2019s \u201cNew York values,\u201d a coded questioning of his rival\u2019s conservatism. But the barb appeared to backfire, eliciting an unexpectedly emotional response from Trump about his hometown\u2019s response to the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.</p>", "<p>\u201cWhen the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThat was a very insulting statement that Ted made.\u201d</p>", "<p>At times, the contest between some of the more mainstream candidates seeking to emerge as an alternative to Trump and Cruz was just as fiery, particularly between Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.</p>", "<p>Rubio likened Christie\u2019s policies to President Obama\u2019s, particularly on guns, Planned Parenthood and education reform - an attack Christie declared false. Seeking to undermine Rubio\u2019s qualifications for president, Christie suggested that senators \u201ctalk and talk and talk\u201d while governors such as himself are \u201cheld accountable for everything you do.\u201d</p>", "<p>Rubio entered the debate as the top target for most of the other establishment-minded candidates. He largely escaped the criticism of his Senate voting record and immigration policies that have dogged him on the campaign trail and in television advertisements blanketing airwaves in early voting states - until near the end when Cruz confronted him on immigration.</p>", "<p>Rubio fired back by accusing Cruz of switching positions on immigration himself, then ticking off a litany of other areas where he said the Texas senator had flip-flopped.</p>", "<p>\u201cThat is not consistent conservatism,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cThat is political calculation.\u201d</p>", "<p>Cruz was also on the defensive about his failure to disclose on federal election forms some $1 million in loans from Wall Street banks during his 2012 Senate campaign. He said it was little more than a \u201cpaperwork error.\u201d</p>", "<p>Rubio and Christie are among the candidates seeking to break out of the establishment pack, particularly in the New Hampshire primary, which quickly follows the lead-off Iowa caucuses. The race in Iowa has settled into a tight, two-way contest between Trump and Cruz.</p>", "<p>Thursday night\u2019s debate came at the end of a week that has highlighted anew the deep rifts in the Republican Party. South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, a rising GOP star, was widely praised by many party leaders for including a veiled criticism of Trump\u2019s angry rhetoric during her response to Obama\u2019s State of the Union address - only to be chastised by conservative commentators and others for the exact same comment.</p>", "<p>Trump said he wasn\u2019t offended by Haley\u2019s speech and argued his anger is justified.</p>", "<p>\u201cI\u2019m very angry because our country is being run horribly,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I will gladly accept the mantle of anger.\u201d</p>", "<p>Trump also stuck with his controversial call for temporarily banning Muslims from the United States because of fear of terrorism emanating from abroad. He said he had no regrets about the proposal and noted his poll numbers rose after he announced the plan.</p>", "<p>Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who has emerged as a frequent critic of Trump, urged the front-runner to reconsider the policy.</p>", "<p>\u201cWhat kind of signal does that send to the rest of the world?\u201d said Bush, who has struggled to gain any momentum in the race and often appeared overshadowed Thursday night.</p>", "<p>Ohio Gov. John Kasich also broke with Trump on the Muslim ban, but like the entire GOP field, called for at least a temporary halt on the Obama administration\u2019s plan to allow thousands of Syrian refugees into the country.</p>", "<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been for pausing the Syrian refugees,\u201d Kasich said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t want to put everybody in the same category.\u201d</p>", "<p>On the economy and national security, the candidates agreed any of them would be better than Obama or Hillary Clinton.</p>", "<p>\u201cOn Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama, and it sounds like everything in the world was going amazing,\u201d Christie said.</p>", "<p>Bush suggested the country was less safe under Obama and declared Clinton would be a \u201cnational security disaster.\u201d</p>", "<p>Rubio went even further, saying Clinton was \u201cdisqualified for being commander in chief,\u201d accusing her of mishandling classified information and lying to the families of Americans killed in the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya.</p>", "<p>Ben Carson, who has fallen behind his rivals despite being well-liked among Republican voters, generated laughs after joking about having to wait nearly 15 minutes to get his first question.</p>", "<p>\u201cI was happy to get a question this early on,\u201d the retired neurosurgeon said with a big smile.</p>", "<p>Tighter rules for Thursday\u2019s debate, hosted by Fox Business Network, resulted in a smaller cast of candidates in the main event. Businesswoman Carly Fiorina was bumped to the undercard event, as was Kentucky Sen.

Prison officials say the policy prevents inmates from concealing contraband or quickly changing their appearance in an escape.</p>", "<p>* Born in <a href=\"/topics/jerusalem/\">Jerusalem</a>: The case of an American born in <a href=\"/topics/jerusalem/\">Jerusalem</a> who wants his passport to list his birthplace as Israel underlies a major dispute between Congress and the president, with Middle Eastern politics as the backdrop. The United States has never recognized any nation\u2019s sovereignty over <a href=\"/topics/jerusalem/\">Jerusalem</a>, believing the city\u2019s status should be resolved in peace negotiations. The administration says a 2002 law passed by Congress allowing Israel to be listed as the birthplace of <a href=\"/topics/jerusalem/\">Jerusalem</a>-born Americans would in essence be seen as a U.S. endorsement of Israeli control of the city.</p>", "<p>* Pregnancy discrimination: A United Parcel Service employee says the company failed to accommodate her pregnancy when it refused to give her light-duty work. But UPS contends its policies are \u201cpregnancy-neutral,\u201d allowing light-duty assignments only in cases where employees are injured on the job or have certain medical conditions.</p>", "<p>* Religious discrimination: Retailer Abercrombie and Fitch is defending its denial of a job to a woman wearing a Muslim headscarf by arguing that she did not say during her interview that she wears the hijab for religious reasons.</p>", "<p>___</p>", "<p>Cases the justices could decide to hear before the term ends in late June:</p>", "<p>* Gay marriage:  Both sides want the justices to settle the question of whether same-sex couples have the same right to marry as heterosexuals under the Constitution. A court ruling in favor of same-sex marriage would grant marriage rights to same-sex couples in all 50 states, up from 19 states and the District of Columbia. A decision in favor of state marriage bans would allow states to continue setting the rules on whether to allow same-sex couples to wed.</p>", "<p>* Abortion: Several states have passed laws in recent years aimed at limiting abortion by imposing hospital admitting privilege requirements on doctors who perform abortions, forcing abortion clinic facilities to meet tougher standards and preventing doctors from prescribing pills for medical abortions later in a pregnancy and at a lower dose. The <a href=\"/topics/supreme-court/\">court</a> could take one or more cases that are winding through the courts.</p>", "<p>* Contraception: The next fight over the new health care law\u2019s requirement that contraception be offered to women among a range of preventive services at no extra cost concerns the responsibilities of religious not-for-profit universities, hospitals and other institutions. The Obama administration already allows those organizations to shift responsibility for coverage to their insurers, but the groups say that so-called accommodation still is a burden on their religious consciences. In June, the justices said family-owned corporations with religious objections do not have to pay for contraceptives for women covered under their health plans.</p>"], "article_author": []}

Other countries in the region with elevated per capita homicide rates include Venezuela, Belize and Jamaica.</p>", "<p>In comparison, Britain\u2019s homicide rate is about one per 100,000 residents, the U.S. rate is about four and Brazil\u2019s is 25, according to the latest available data from the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime.</p>", "<p>Authorities in <a href=\"/topics/el-salvador/\">El Salvador</a> blame most of the killings there on rival gangs involved in drug trafficking, extortion rackets and other criminal activity. The \u201cmaras,\u201d as they are known, have a heavy presence in poor neighborhoods across the country and have increasingly moved into rural areas as well.</p>", "<p>Bloodshed spiked after the 2014 breakdown of a truce between the nation\u2019s two most powerful syndicates \u2014 the 18th Street gang and the Mara Salvatrucha, or MS-13. Both have established deep ties inside the U.S. because they were founded by Central American immigrants in Los Angeles.</p>", "<p>But their current reach is felt most in the Northern Triangle. Jeannette Aguilar, a researcher at Jose Simeon Canas Central American University, told The Associated Press that the soaring homicide rate in <a href=\"/topics/el-salvador/\">El Salvador</a> \u201creflects the inability of the Salvadoran state and the Salvadoran society to guarantee the most fundamental right there can be in a society, which is life.\u201d</p>", "<p>Such assessments have widened a political wedge that immigrant rights advocates are eager to exploit as the debate rages on the campaign trail over the <a href=\"/topics/barack-obama/\">Obama administration</a>\u2019s response to the surge of migrants from the countries south of <a href=\"/topics/mexico/\">Mexico</a>.</p>", "<p>On the Republican side, presidential front-runner Donald Trump\u2019s promise to build a wall on the southern border \u2014 to be paid for by Mexico \u2014 has captured the headlines, but virtually all of the Republican candidates stress the need for greater border controls and what they say is the failure of the <a href=\"/topics/barack-obama/\">Obama administration</a> to enforce the country\u2019s immigration laws.</p>", "<p>Democratic presidential hopeful Bernard Sanders fired off a letter Thursday demanding that the <a href=\"/topics/barack-obama/\">administration</a> halt its latest round of deportation raids, which U.S. officials say have netted at least 121 illegal immigrant parents and children.</p>", "<p>Mr. Sanders, a Vermont independent who is running as a Democrat, urged Mr. Obama and Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson to declare Central America so unsafe that people from that region are allowed to stay and work in the U.S. \u2014 a policy known as temporary protected status.</p>", "<p>\u201cI urge you to immediately end these raids and not deport families back to countries where a death sentence awaits,\u201d Mr. Sanders wrote.</p>"], "article_author": ["Guy Taylor", "Stephen Dinan"]}

The result, according to one newly released analysis of the competition, \u201cwill likely include more terrorist attacks on the West.\u201d</p>", "<p>AQIM claimed responsibility for an assault that killed 29 people at a luxury hotel popular with international tourists in Burkina Faso on Jan. 15. The first-ever <a href=\"/topics/al-qaeda/\">al Qaeda</a> attack in the tiny West African nation came just two months after the group had carried out a similar hotel strike that killed 22 people in Mali.</p>", "<p>The West will likely be one of the chief targets as the rivalry heats up. That\u2019s the core assessment of a new Brookings Institution analysis on the expanding rift between the two extremist Sunni Muslim terrorist organizations, whose leaders have \u201cengaged in full-scale verbal hostilities\u201d toward each other since mid-2014.</p>", "<p>The Islamic State \u201chas evolved from being an Iraq-based terrorist organization to a transnational insurgent movement,\u201d the analysis said. \u201cMoreover, it has definitively challenged <a href=\"/topics/al-qaeda/\">al Qaeda</a>\u2019s status as the world\u2019s preeminent Sunni jihadi organization.\u201d</p>", "<p>The group, also known as ISIS and ISIL, now includes \u201cprovinces\u201d in nearly a dozen nations \u2014 the most prominent in Libya, where intelligence sources cite surges in foreign fighters streaming in to join the group.</p>", "<p>Former CIA Director Michael J.

on the world stage.</p>", "<p>Some intelligence sources warn that bin Laden\u2019s original group and its web of seasoned affiliates \u2014 including <a href=\"/topics/al-qaeda/\">al Qaeda</a> in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and AQIM \u2014 could surge back into global prominence even as Islamic State\u2019s digitally savvy appeal continues to spread among younger extremists.</p>", "<p><strong>Battle for influence</strong></p>", "<p>The analysis last week by the Brookings Doha Center found that <a href=\"/topics/al-qaeda/\">al Qaeda</a> is shifting increasingly away from being a clandestine global network plotting on mass-casualty attacks on the West and toward a more locally minded organization focused on holding territory that might otherwise fall to Islamic State.</p>", "<p>\u201cHaving faced a decade of concerted international counterterrorism measures and the new and intensely competitive threat of [Islamic State], <a href=\"/topics/al-qaeda/\">al Qaeda</a> has adapted and refocused its strategy around localist objectives,\u201d the analysis said. \u201c<a href=\"/topics/al-qaeda/\">Al Qaeda</a> affiliates \u2014 particularly Jabhat al-Nusra in Syria and [AQAP] in Yemen \u2014 are now playing a long game, focused on building alliances and growing durable and deep roots within unstable and repressed societies.\u201d</p>", "<p>The Associated Press reported Monday that AQAP had seized new territory in Yemen, where Islamic State also has its own burgeoning provincial operation.</p>", "<p>And while many in Washington see Islamic State \u2014 once dismissed by President Obama as the terrorist \u201cJV team\u201d \u2014 as the primary terror threat at the moment, last week\u2019s Brookings analysis suggested <a href=\"/topics/al-qaeda/\">al Qaeda</a>\u2019s older generation of jihadis may have a strategic edge in the long run.</p>", "<p>While not matching Islamic State\u2019s expertise at propaganda and the use of social media, <a href=\"/topics/al-qaeda/\">al Qaeda</a> and its affiliates take care to avoid alienating local populations by embracing a far less strict posture than Islamic State when it comes to the imposition of extremist Shariah law.</p>", "<p>Where Islamic State is obsessed with harsh Shariah and \u201cavoids compromising its severe religious mores by intensively collecting local intelligence, strictly controlling local populations, and brutally suppressing dissent,\u201d the analysis said, <a href=\"/topics/al-qaeda/\">al Qaeda</a> seeks to \u201cdurably root itself within Muslim societies and build a sustainable jihad capable of simultaneously targeting the \u2018near\u2019 and \u2018far\u2019 enemies.\u201d</p>", "<p>Islamic State\u2019s high profile and momentum may be garnering global headlines, but <a href=\"/topics/al-qaeda/\">al Qaeda</a>\u2019s \u201ctraditionalist trend continues to attract a steady stream of recruits around the world,\u201d the analysis said.</p>", "<p>It added that while Islamic State\u2019s establishment of a \u201ccaliphate\u201d allowed the group to claim an achievement that <a href=\"/topics/al-qaeda/\">al Qaeda</a> had failed for 20 years to do, the speed of Islamic State\u2019s subsequent international expansion \u201cmakes it vulnerable.\u201d</p>", "<p>\u201cThroughout much of its controlled territories, [Islamic State] has decidedly shallow roots compared to <a href=\"/topics/al-qaeda/\">al Qaeda</a>, which may negatively impact its capacity to retain its momentum and to define itself as a state, let alone a caliphate.\u201d</p>", "<p>It\u2019s a factor than many experts say embodies the main gap in strategy between Islamic State founder Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and Ayman al-Zawahri, who took over <a href=\"/topics/al-qaeda/\">al Qaeda</a> and its affiliates following the 2011 U.S. Special Forces raid that killed bin Laden.</p>", "<p>\u201cThis is a core reason that <a href=\"/topics/al-qaeda/\">al Qaeda</a>\u2019s top leaders always resisted declaring a caliphate,\u201d said Bill Roggio, a counterterrorism expert and editor of The Long War Journal published by the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.</p>", "<p>\u201cIt\u2019s the whole crux of the disagreement between ISIS and <a href=\"/topics/al-qaeda/\">al Qaeda</a>, whose leaders always said that the premature declaration of a caliphate was dangerous because, if it was lost quickly, it would delegitimize their overall movement,\u201d Mr. Roggio said in a recent interview.</p>", "<p>What follows, he added, is the \u201cmillion-dollar question\u201d of why the U.S. and its allies have been unable to destroy Islamic State\u2019s stronghold in Syria and Iraq. \u201cIf you take away that territory,\u201d Mr. Roggio said, \u201cISIS will no longer have the justification of calling itself a state, and I think you\u2019ll see the provinces beyond Syria and Iraq wither.\u201d</p>", "<p>\u201cThe jihadists won\u2019t go away, but you might see a fracturing of ISIS provinces, and elements of them will probably get absorbed back into <a href=\"/topics/al-qaeda/\">al Qaeda</a>,\u201d he said.</p>", "<p><strong>Which is more dangerous?</strong></p>", "<p>One former high-level U.S. intelligence official argues that the differences between <a href=\"/topics/al-qaeda/\">al Qaeda</a> and Islamic State \u2014 specifically Islamic State\u2019s relative tactical impulsiveness compared to <a href=\"/topics/al-qaeda/\">al Qaeda</a> \u2014 are cause for concern when assessing the kinds of terrorist attacks the newer group may be willing to pursue.</p>", "<p>\u201cThe group operates with fewer restraints than any other terrorists we\u2019ve encountered since 9/11,\u201d John McLaughlin, a former deputy and acting director of the CIA, wrote in an article published last week by Ozy Media.</p>", "<p>He argued that while <a href=\"/topics/al-qaeda/\">al Qaeda</a> leaders once scolded Islamic State\u2019s predecessor, <a href=\"/topics/al-qaeda/\">al Qaeda</a> in Iraq, for \u201ckilling too many Muslims,\u201d the current leaders of Islamic State seem to \u201chave no qualms about killing Muslims.\u201d</p>", "<p>When it comes to the use of such unconventional warfare as chemical or nuclear weapons, Mr. McLaughlin wrote, \u201ceven terrorist groups that have sought them may have hesitated because of the certainty that using such weapons would draw sharper retaliation from the U.S. and others.\u201d</p>", "<p>\u201cBut [Islamic State] seems to want nothing more than to pull us into direct confrontation, on the theory that it could draw coalition blood and hasten the violent final confrontation with \u2018infidels\u2019 that its bizarre theology predicts and seeks.\u201d</p>", "<p>Current intelligence officials note that mass-casualty attacks carried out by <a href=\"/topics/al-qaeda/\">al Qaeda</a> during the late-1990s and early-2000s \u2014 a history climaxed by 9/11 \u2014 still far outweigh anything Islamic State has so far achieved in terms of terrorism on Western targets.</p>", "<p>Some suggest that <a href=\"/topics/al-qaeda/\">al Qaeda</a> may be just as likely as Islamic State to pursue spectacular attacks on the West going forward.</p>", "<p>CIA Director John Brennan said last fall that while Islamic State has established itself as \u201cthe epitome of a cancer that\u2019s metastasizing,\u201d it would only take one grand operation to reestablish <a href=\"/topics/al-qaeda/\">al Qaeda</a>\u2019s global preeminence.</p>", "<p>During a roundtable with reporters in September, Mr. Brennan said it was difficult to rank the two groups in terms of which presents a greater threat to U.S. national security.</p>", "<p>\u201cYou cannot really address that question with an either/or answer,\u201d he said. \u201cClearly <a href=\"/topics/al-qaeda/\">al Qaeda</a>, because of what it has done over the years, still represents a significant threat.\u201d</p>"], "article_author": ["Guy Taylor"]}

its affiliates take care to avoid alienating local populations by embracing a far less strict posture than Islamic State when it comes to the imposition of extremist Shariah law.</p>", "<p>Where Islamic State is obsessed with harsh Shariah and \u201cavoids compromising its severe religious mores by intensively collecting local intelligence, strictly controlling local populations, and brutally suppressing dissent,\u201d the analysis said, <a href=\"/topics/al-qaeda/\">al Qaeda</a> seeks to \u201cdurably root itself within Muslim societies and build a sustainable jihad capable of

compared to <a href=\"/topics/al-qaeda/\">al Qaeda</a>, which may negatively impact its capacity to retain its momentum and to define itself as a state, let alone a caliphate.\u201d</p>", "<p>It\u2019s a factor than many experts say embodies the main gap in strategy between Islamic State founder Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and Ayman al-Zawahri, who took over <a href=\"/topics/al-qaeda/\">al

"<p>\u201cIt\u2019s the whole crux of the disagreement between ISIS and <a href=\"/topics/al-qaeda/\">al Qaeda</a>, whose leaders always said that the premature declaration of a caliphate was dangerous because, if it was lost quickly, it would delegitimize their overall movement,\u201d Mr. Roggio said in a recent interview.</p>", "<p>What follows, he added, is the \u201cmillion-dollar

Indeed, roadways and neighborhood streets remain bogged down. Still, there\u2019s another worrisome and certainly more prevailing issue that lurks among us: Roving, flash mob-like bands of teens attacking Metro riders.</p>", "<p>Much of the violence is occurring in Metrorail\u2019s central core, where stations such as L\u2019Enfant Plaza and Gallery Place-Chinatown are designated transfer points for various lines. At L\u2019Enfant, for example, riders on five different lines can transfer. At Gallery Place-Chinatown handles three rail lines. Those stations, like all stations, also offer connecting Metrobus service.</p>", "<p>Yet there is a perhaps noticeable difference between L\u2019Enfant Plaza\u2019s commercial surroundings and those at Gallery Place-Chinatown. Commuters can easily walk to the National Mall, Capitol Hill and other D.C. attractions within minutes of the L\u2019Enfant station, and tourists and other visitors can jet from the L\u2019Enfant Plaza Hotel to Reagan National Airport or cruise into the western parts of Northern Virginia on the new Silver Line. The Metro station is also enticing for quick bites, a cup of Joe or catching up on email.</p>", "<p>Gallery Place-Chinatown offers far different imagery, though. The three rail lines that converge there regularly carry schoolchildren, young and old people trekking to various judicial authorities, fast-food seekers, moviegoers, bowling enthusiasts,  museum-goers, commuters, book lovers to the main branch of the D.C. Public Library System, happy hour-goers, a plethora of sit-down restaurants, federal and D.C. office workers,  shoppers to Urban Outfitters, Bed Bath and Beyond, and other retail establishments, bicyclists, nightclub venues, and crowds drawn to sporting and entertainment events at the Verizon Center.</p>", "<p>Oh, the area is also a big draw for the panhandlers, drunks and homeless, and groups of members in the LGBT community. And drugs and other illicit goings-on.</p>", "<p>Gallery Place-Chinatown is also one of two rail stations closest to Metro\u2019s headquarters.</p>", "<p>That\u2019s a powerful mix of folks in a two-block area. And it\u2019s like that day and night \u2014 24-7-365.</p>", "<p>Recent Metro attacks include one during morning rush on Thursday, when as many as two dozen teens ganged up and brutally beat a 35-year-old man. On New Year\u2019s Day, eight teens reportedly beat three other youths. A 19-year-old was pushed around.</p>", "<p>Authorities and lawmakers are concerned. Said D.C. Council member Jack Evans to Channel 5/Fox News: \u201cIf we have roaming groups of youths attacking people, that\u2019s unacceptable and something we have to put to a stop.\u201d</p>", "<p>Well, Mr. Evans is now the head chairman in charge of Metro, having been unanimously elected this week to the board. A father of triplets, Jack is probably well-acquainted with a lasso and he\u2019ll soon learn it\u2019s needed at Metro, too.</p>", "<p>Metro is a bureaucratic boondoggle, and it needs to be fixed, because its wish list includes expansion and funding, its to-do list includes maintenance and personnel, and its must-do list includes public safety following some tragic rail incidents.</p>", "<p>Passenger safety falls onto the latter list.</p>", "<p>Metro cannot issue a blanket prohibition against people entering Metro stations or riding the rails or buses. However, its board and new general manager, Paul Wiedefeld, can become more creative regarding passenger safety.</p>", "<p>Mr. Evans should put on his \u201cdaddy jeans,\u201d get out of his sporty-orty car, and ride the buses and the rails to see the who, how and when of Metro service.

In my experience, oftentimes a domestic violence incident is excused by the caregiver, due to the service member or veteran having PTSD. It is also important to note that domestic violence can happen in any type of relationship, and is not always the stereotypical male abusing female. Women can be abusers as well.</p>", "<p>Using PTSD as a reason to downgrade the seriousness of domestic violence hurts both the victim and those who are suffering from PTSD. Although there is a difference between an individual lashing out for a medical reason. For example: a veteran in the middle of a hallucinogenic flashback or inappropriate reactions due to poor cognitive skills and an individual hitting a person for a reason such as the victim\u2019s choice of clothing; both types of events can be just as traumatic for the victim(s) involved.</p>", "<p>By brushing off abusive behavior as a justifiable \u201cPTSD\u201d behavior, many are helping to spread the message that if a victim is abused by someone who also happens to have a PTSD diagnosis, it is acceptable. It is not.</p>", "<p>If an individual is becoming aggressive towards others, or themselves after a traumatic situation, this behavior is a warning sign, a symptom that something is wrong. Those close to the individual with undiagnosed (or diagnosed) PSTD usually willingly or unknowingly assume the role of a caregiver, helping the individual obtain medical care and long term treatment. The <a href=\"http://www.ptsd.va.gov/index.asp\" target=\"_blank\">Veterans Administration\u2019s website on PTSD</a>\u00a0 is a great tool to start learning about PTSD.</p>", "<p>The victim in these circumstances needs to know that what happened to them was not OK. The victim also needs to be educated about both domestic violence and PTSD. This education can help the victim to make a choice. The VA has resources on its <a href=\"http://www.ptsd.va.gov/public/types/violence/domestic-violence.asp\" target=\"_blank\">website for those who may be involved in an abusive relationship or a domestic violence situation</a>.</p>", "<p>Does the victim stay in the relationship while the individual receives treatment for their PTSD? Or possibly do they realize the warning signs of being in an abusive relationship were there long before the abuser\u2019s traumatic event occurred, and decide to leave? This is up to the victim to decide and their decision should be supported.</p>", "<p>The abuser also needs to know that their behavior was not OK. They need to decide if they are willing to receive, and actively participate in treatment for PTSD. Or if PTSD (or another medical illness or injury) was not the cause of their abusive behavior, they should make the conscious decision to end the relationship, for the benefit of all parties involved.</p>", "<p>A military caregiver I\u2019ll call Sandy for privacy, said her husband realized he needed help after he attacked her during a PTSD-induced flashback. It has been 10 years since the incident and with the veteran\u2019s active participation in treatment, both parties have said their relationship has greatly improved.</p>", "<p>PTSD is not an excuse for violence against oneself or another. It is a medical condition as a result of a traumatic experience and should be addressed as such. So, whether or not you agree with <a href=\"/topics/sarah-palin/\">Mrs. Palin</a>\u2019s comments, I am encouraged by the starting of conversations regarding PTSD and domestic violence within the military community as a result of her statement.</p>"], "article_author": ["Emery A.

For about 300 years, until the mid-19th century, Roman Jews were forced to live in the neighborhood, the first ghetto ever, which is still called by that name.\u00a0 But on this particular January Sunday, the Pope called for Jews and Christians to \u201cfeel like brothers united by the same God and by a rich common spiritual heritage,\u201d He urged Christians to take pilgrimages to the Holy Land to visit Israel.\u00a0 And he spoke out strongly against those who use religion to incite and justify acts of barbaric violence.<br><br>The two giant religious figures, Dr. King and Pope Francis, spread life-affirming messages of peace.\u00a0 Today, Pope Francis is one of the world\u2019s favorite religious leaders.\u00a0 Politically and diplomatically savvy, the Pontiff is also the authentic article.\u00a0 He is a pastor who\u2019s been in the trenches, and an international leader with the courage to face the blemishes and failures of the Roman Catholic Church he now leads.\u00a0 The 21st century Vatican is building on work that began 50 years ago with \u201cNostra aetate\u201d (In Our Time), which redefined Vatican ties with Judaism.\u00a0 Its recently published document, \u201cThe Gifts and Calling of God are Irrevocable,\u201d appears to be a theological breakthrough, eliminating the Catholic mission to the Jews and affirming \u201cthat the Jews are participants in God\u2019s salvation is theologically unquestionable\u2026\u201d\u00a0 It calls on Catholics to work with Jews to combat anti-Semitism.<br><br>Martin Luther King and the pope are certainly not the only life-affirming modern spiritual leaders, although they are among the most widely recognized.\u00a0 There are others, lesser known, who cultivate the fields of peace. Rabbi Menachem Froman of Tekoa was one of those men of peace.\u00a0\u00a0 He lived in the town where the biblical prophet Amos was born and spoke \u2013 and lived \u2013 a prophetic message.\u00a0 Rabbi Froman believed that people who are authentically religious share the spiritual depth that is the foundation of peace.\u00a0 He was trusted and befriended by Sheiks and Imams, the religious leaders of the neighboring villages. \u00a0<br><br>Inspired once again by the life-affirming words of these spiritual leaders, for a little while last week, I felt hopeful about the world.<br><br>Then two acts of grotesque violence shattered my hope. \u00a0<br><br>In the middle of a quiet day, a terrorist broke into the home of Dafna Meir, a 38-year-old nurse and mother of six, and stabbed her to death, while three of her children were inside. \u00a0<br><br>Dafna Meir\u2019s life was a portrait in life-affirmation: She worked as a nurse, advised about fertility issues, and was raising a family that included foster children \u2013 Dafna was \u201cpaying it forward\u201d in appreciation for the foster family that raised her from age 13. \u00a0<br><br>One good life is so fragile, and impacts so many others; hope is so easily destroyed!\u00a0 The alleged killer was soon arrested. He is 15 years old, a teenager stewed in hate, stirred by a culture that glorifies death.<br><br>If this column were fiction, I would stop right here.\u00a0 This is tragedy enough.\u00a0 Sadly, though, this is not fiction; it is fact, and there is more to tell.\u00a0 There was a second stabbing that day, and the victim was pregnant.\u00a0 The pregnant stabbing victim is the young daughter-in-law of peaceful Rabbi Froman.\u00a0 She is expected to recover.<br><br>Like trees consumed by a forest fire, my hopefulness went up in smoke.\u00a0 I thought it was gone for good.<br><br>But then I read the following words and felt a faint stirring \u2013 of tiny green shoots trying to poke through the ashes.\u00a0 In an interview with the Hebrew-language Yedioth Ahronoth daily, Dafna Meir\u2019s bereaved husband, Natan, said he harbored no anger toward Palestinians in general for his wife\u2019s death.\u00a0 \u201cWe don\u2019t have anger,\u201d he said. \u201cI am not angry at anyone. We don\u2019t fill ourselves with that. We don\u2019t curse Arabs. I sit and talk with my kids and I haven\u2019t heard a single word of that. We\u2019re not people who hate. Dafna and I weren\u2019t brought up that way.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0<br><br>When Israeli President <span class=\"st\">Reuven</span> Rivlin visited the grieving family, the young widower told him, \u201cDafna believed, as we do, that love is so much more powerful than hate.\u201d<br><br>These are the people who keep hope alive.</p>"], "article_author": ["Renee Garfinkel"]}

Richard E. White</a>, passed away due to suicide. It is unknown why the colonel decided to take his own life.

According to the RAND Hidden Heroes: America\u2019s Military Caregivers study, 38 percent of post-9/11 military caregivers meet the criteria for depression and only 34 percent of the caregivers who meet this criteria are receiving mental health treatment. For pre-9/11 caregivers, 19 percent meet the criteria for depression, and 37 percent of the pre-9/11 caregivers who meet this criteria are receiving mental health treatment.</p>", "<p>The month of September is Suicide Prevention Month and the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) is working to raise awareness of not only veteran suicide, but also veteran caregiver and family suicide. <span>The <a href=\"http://www.veteranscrisisline.net\" target=\"_blank\">Veterans Crisis Line</a> is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

A mother of two, Mrs. Smith said she \u201cnever felt the sheer desperation and lack of will to fight anymore until our last two years.\u201d She had grown exhausted, and was struggling while dealing with her husband. In addition, finances were a major strain and the family almost ended up homeless.</p>", "<p>\u201cI had aged 20 years in two years \u2026 I had unidentified medical issues reeking [sic] havoc on my body. Dying consumed my thoughts. All I wanted to do was kill myself. I stopped eating. I barely drank anything. I lost 50 lbs in a month. I just wanted to die,\u201d \u2028said \u2028Mrs. Smith.</p>", "<p>She credits being a mother and her family for not following through with her thoughts.

For the past six years, <a href=\"/topics/allyson-bowers/\">Allyson</a> has helped <a href=\"/topics/ben/\">Ben</a> in his recovery, supporting him as he has struggled to overcome his addiction.</p>", "<p>During the beginning of 2011, Ben, with <a href=\"/topics/allyson-bowers/\">Allyson</a>\u2019s support, made the decision to seek medical help for his undiagnosed PTSD and addiction. While active duty, it was difficult for Ben to receive the treatment he needed, treatment that focused on his addiction as a symptom of his PTSD. This led to a cycle of sobriety, drug abuse and recovery, which <a href=\"/topics/allyson-bowers/\">Allyson</a> struggled to cope with as a caregiver.</p>", "<p><a href=\"/topics/allyson-bowers/\">Allyson</a> explained that one of the reasons why military caregivers of veterans who are battling addiction feel isolated is due to stigma. The failure of others, including family, friends and medical professionals to view the veteran\u2019s addiction as a symptom of medical conditions resulting from battle and not as just a drug addict. There is also a stigma against the caregiver for staying with a veteran who is also an addict. <a href=\"/topics/allyson-bowers/\">Allyson</a> believes that the \u201ccaregiver needs support especially if they are going to stay. They need to know what to do and where to go. Where the support system is without being labeled as an enabler.\u201d</p>", "<p>It is a balance of encouraging recovery while not enabling the veteran to continue with his or her addiction.</p>", "<p>When Ben was medically retired from the Army and transitioned to the Veteran\u2019s Health Administration for his medical care, he connected with a psychiatrist who recognized the substance abuse as a maladaptive coping skill of Ben\u2019s PTSD. Due to a high turn-around, Ben struggled with finding a VA counselor who was able to provide long-term treatment.</p>", "<p>According to research done by the VA, drug and alcohol use by veterans allows them to create what is called a cycle of avoidance, which in turn can make the PTSD last longer. The VA identified other health problems in veterans suffering from both PTSD and SUD. Those other problems include: relationship problems, sleep problems and functionality, such as keeping a job. For veterans who are suffering from both PTSD and SUD, the VA encourages them to reach out to a SUD-PTSD specialist.</p>", "<p>Too often, caregivers such as <a href=\"/topics/allyson-bowers/\">Allyson</a> express that they are frustrated with the lack of treatment options that are able to simultaneously address all aspects of a veteran\u2019s care, including addiction. While <a href=\"/topics/allyson-bowers/\">Allyson</a> was recovering from a miscarriage, Ben relapsed at 22 months of sobriety. It was several months until Ben found treatment via a private rehabilitation center that addressed both the addiction and PTSD. After leaving rehab, it took Ben a few months, due to a staffing shortage at the VA, to find a new counselor at a vet center. \u2028\u2028In response to the alarming rate of opioid pain management use by veterans, the VA is working to expand their chronic pain management program to include not only pain management by medication, but alternatives such as yoga, psycho-education, aquatic therapy, biofeedback and acupuncture, to name a few.</p>", "<p>However, due to funding and staffing limitations, these options are not always available at all VA facilities nationwide.</p>", "<p>Military caregivers such as <a href=\"/topics/allyson-bowers/\">Allyson</a> face a unique struggle, which often isolates them from even others within the military caregiving community. Not only do they deal with the challenges of helping a veteran recover from the physical and emotional wounds of war, they deal with an addict trapped in the cycle of substance abuse. <a href=\"/topics/allyson-bowers/\">Allyson</a> has learned to set healthy boundaries for herself, while supporting <a href=\"/topics/ben/\">Ben</a> in his recovery.</p>", "<p>At the time of writing, Ben is currently in a private, long-term inpatient treatment program. <a href=\"/topics/allyson-bowers/\">Allyson</a> also said that dealing with an addict \u201calways makes me think of the drowning in man: throw him a life jacket but he does not grab it, then a life preserver and still not reaching for it, so you jump in to help and he tries to drag you with him.\u201d</p>", "<p><a href=\"/topics/allyson-bowers/\">Allyson</a> is also working to help bring awareness to the issue of substance abuse disorders in the veteran population. By speaking out and sharing her story, <a href=\"/topics/allyson-bowers/\">Allyson</a> wants to share the message with other military caregivers in similar circumstances and let them know that they are not alone.</p>"], "article_author": ["Emery A.

At their urging, <a href=\"/topics/ben-carson/\">Mr. Carson</a> performed additional scans, and found that \u201cthe nature of the tumor had changed,\u201d allowing him to remove the malignancy.</p>", "<p>He then brought onstage Chris Pylant, a minister from Florida.</p>", "<p>\u201cI want to end with something special here tonight,\u201d <a href=\"/topics/ben-carson/\">Mr. Carson</a> said. \u201cThe young man who was 4 years old, today is his 35th birthday, and he is now a minister.\u201d</p>", "<p>Compared with such experiences, pulling off the upset in Iowa may seem for <a href=\"/topics/ben-carson/\">Mr. Carson</a> less like a miracle than just another day at the office.</p>", "<p>\u201cNone of the other stuff matters,\u201d <a href=\"/topics/ben-carson/\">Mr. Carson</a> said. \u201cYou know, people think that this political stuff or wealth or any of that stuff makes a difference \u2014 it makes absolutely no difference.

In addition to former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, Mr. Cruz and Mr. Rubio have been intensifying their message with religious communities.</p>", "<p><a href=\"/topics/ben-carson/\">Mr. Carson</a>\u2019s ads on Iowa television emphasize his work as a surgeon saving infants along with the three pillars of his campaign: \u201ccourage, inner strength, belief in God.\u201d</p>", "<p>\u201cIt\u2019s clear who he\u2019s appealing to,\u201d said Mr. Goldford. \u201cWhether there are enough [Christian voters] to keep him in the race, particularly when Cruz is basing a huge element of his campaign on that constituency, it\u2019s hard to say. I\u2019d be surprised if it was enough to sustain him.\u201d</p>", "<p>He added that \u201cCruz looks to people like somebody who checks all the evangelical boxes, but he\u2019s considered more of a full-service candidate, if you will.\u201d</p>", "<p>Although Mr. Trump isn\u2019t seen as particularly appealing to Christians, several of those who attended Revive 714 said they were trying to decide between the New York real estate magnate and <a href=\"/topics/ben-carson/\">Mr. Carson</a>. The common thread: Both are seen as political outsiders.</p>", "<p>\u201cTrump\u2019s one of those who could go into Washington, D.C., and move the machinery,\u201d said Mark Lehr of Sioux City, who attended Revive 714 with his wife Mary Lehr. \u201cIt\u2019s just that we don\u2019t know where his heart is.\u201d</p>", "<p>Ms. Lehr said she decided that day to vote for <a href=\"/topics/ben-carson/\">Mr. Carson</a>, citing his ability throughout his career \u201cto unite people and not divide them.\u201d</p>", "<p>\u201cHe represents what we believe in,\u201d she added.</p>", "<p>At the rally, <a href=\"/topics/ben-carson/\">Mr. Carson</a> received shoutouts from Kirk Cameron, the former \u201cGrowing Pains\u201d teen star who\u2019s now a force in Christian entertainment, and the top Christian band Casting Crowns.</p>", "<p>\u201c<a href=\"/topics/ben-carson/\">Dr. Carson</a> has spent his whole life healing people, and became one of the great, most skilled and renowned surgeons in all the world,\u201d Mr. Cameron told the audience.</p>", "<p>In a not-so-subtle reference to Mr. Trump, Mr. Cameron added that, \u201c<a href=\"/topics/ben-carson/\">Dr. Carson</a>, by the way, will not shout at you. We don\u2019t need loudmouths, we need leaders with resolve. <a href=\"/topics/ben-carson/\">Dr. Carson</a> is one of those leaders, and anyone who meets him knows that.\u201d</p>", "<p>At the end of the day, however, <a href=\"/topics/ben-carson/\">Mr. Carson</a> is his own best campaign asset. At Revive 714 he never mentioned his campaign or the issues directly, instead relaying his incredible life story, filled with both humor and shocking moments.</p>", "<p>He recounted that he once tried to hit his mother with a hammer and was stopped by his brother. The turning point for him came when he struck another boy in the abdomen with a camping knife. Only the boy\u2019s belt buckle prevented him from being wounded.</p>", "<p>Afterward, he said, \u201cI locked myself in the bathroom, and I just started contemplating my life. But I realized that had he not had that belt buckle, I\u2019d be on my way to jail or reform school. And I realized I would never accomplish my goal of becoming a physician with a temper like that. And I fell on my knees and said, \u2018Lord, I can\u2019t control it. I cannot control my temper. My life is going to be wasted unless you intervene.\u2019\u201d</p>", "<p>There was a Bible in the bathroom, and he opened it to the Book of Proverbs, with verse after verse about the importance of controlling one\u2019s temper.</p>", "<p><a href=\"?page=3\" onclick=\"_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'Pagination', 'StoryContinues', '/news/2016/jan/25/ben-carson-highlights-patriotism-faith-compelling-/']);trackclick(this);\"><em>Story Continues \u2192</em></a></p>"], "article_author": []}

I really believe he would be the man.\u201d</p>", "<p>It so happens that <a href=\"/topics/ben-carson/\">Mr. Carson</a> is counting on the same dynamic to lift him over Mr. Trump, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, all of whom are ahead of him just days before Monday\u2019s caucuses.</p>", "<p>\u201cI\u2019m just getting in front of people.

The other lives in Chicago, U.S.A.</p>", "<p>Sabeen is very jumpy these days.  She used to be a good student, but now has trouble concentrating.  She\u2019s often too tired to get up for school because she has difficulty sleeping and suffers frequent nightmares. Sabeen\u2019s Aleppo neighborhood is a battlefield: Terrifying barrel bombs drop from the sky, automatic weapons sound in the streets.

Her classmate, Shamiya, age 11, was killed while playing in a friend\u2019s bedroom.  The urban warfare is taking its toll on this little girl: Amara\u2019s grades at school have plunged so far she may have to repeat sixth grade.  She doesn\u2019t know why she feels guilty, and has secretly begun cutting herself to get some relief.  Her brother says he\u2019s joining a gang.</p>", "<p>Although Sabeen and Amara are not real people, their experiences and symptoms are very real, and have been reported in children in combat zones abroad, and violent neighborhoods at home.</p>", "<p>It is bad enough to see the harm done to children at the time they are exposed to violence, but that is not the whole story.   The impact of violence on children continues long into their future \u2026 and may even be permanent.</p>", "<p>Exposure to violence has the potential to permanently damage a growing child\u2019s brain. Chronic, extreme stress is toxic to the development of young brains.  Damage is evident in the areas of the brain involved with learning and memory, concentration and emotional regulation.  The brain damage results in poorer cognitive and academic performance, and more impulsive behavior, a combination that set the stage for future failure, and for problems such as alcohol and drug abuse.</p>", "<p>Trauma is cumulative.  The more you experience, the more likely you are to develop PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) \u2013 a debilitating condition so widespread that the city of Philadelphia has begun to focus on trauma as a major public health issue.  More cities should follow their lead.</p>", "<p>Nevertheless, despite this alarming picture, we know that many children have risen out of the most horrendously violent backgrounds \u2013 war, concentration camps - to live normal, functional, even flourishing lives.   Two factors are consistently found to be protective for children exposed to violence: the presence of a consistent, trustworthy adult, and a community safe haven.</p>", "<p>The first is most important.  It is personal.  A good relationship with a trusted, caring adult helps the child develop a sense of security despite the chaos outside.  Successful adults who emerge from violent backgrounds inevitably attribute their emotional survival to having had a stable relationship with at least one caring adult.</p>", "<p>The second factor, a community safe haven, is a place for children to rest and become calm.   Some inner city schools have \u201csafe spaces,\u201d where students can share their feelings and experiences with teachers trained for the sensitive role.</p>", "<p>These are Band-Aids.  The epidemic of violence that traumatizes our children in inner cities requires presidential leadership.

If you\u2019re fortunate enough to belong to a religious community, you know its many benefits \u2014 fellowship, mutual aid, spiritual connection and worship, to name a few.   Perhaps the greatest spiritual gift is the opportunity for self-examination that supports moral change and personal growth.

So they protected themselves with additional security.</p>", "<p>But fear of retaliation did not dominate their response.  It did not stop there.  It proceeded through self-examination.</p>", "<p>Although Cho had been clearly mentally ill, the community questioned what it might have done to help him and his family earlier.  What support or intervention might have prevented his massacre, they wondered.   Some of their religious leaders called on the community to participate in a 32-day fast, one day for each victim, for repentance.  Theirs was a truly religious response.</p>", "<p>Compare that to the Muslim community\u2019s response to the San Bernadino mass shooting that left 14 people dead and 22 seriously injured.  The murderers were a couple, Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik, strictly religious Muslims who attended a local mosque.</p>", "<p>How did the leadership of the American Muslim community respond?

Of course you have.  It\u2019s natural to feel lonely, especially following a break up or move to a new location.  We\u2019d have no country music or blues if no one ever felt lonely!  But there is another kind of loneliness, loneliness that persists, and that loneliness is deadly.</p>", "<p>\u2022    What steals more years of our lives than obesity?<br>\u2022    What is as much of a risk to life as smoking?<br>\u2022    What shortens a lifespan as much as poverty?</p>", "<p>The answer is loneliness.   There is a growing epidemic of loneliness, and it is quietly killing us.   Loneliness is everywhere around us, but we dare not talk about it since we are Americans, proud of our rugged individualism, steeped in the myth of self-sufficiency.  Increasing numbers of us are lonely, and ashamed of it, because we mistakenly consider it a sign of weakness.</p>", "<p>People can become imprisoned in their loneliness, which is what happened to the troubled computer programmer featured in the hit TV series, \u201cMr. Robot.\u201d  He hacked into his therapist\u2019s private life and resonated to her isolation.  That human connection enabled him to cry out in a therapy session, \u201cI want a way out of loneliness, just like you!\u201d  Indeed many of us do.</p>", "<p>Our lives are increasingly isolated. More of us are single, live alone, don\u2019t belong to churches and volunteer groups, have longer commutes, or work from home, without the casual social contact of the water cooler and coffee room.  Social isolation can creep stealthily into a life, and, with nothing to dislodge it, become the new normal.</p>", "<p>You can be lonely in a crowd.  You can be lonely in a marriage.  One of the basic ingredients of a good life is having a confidant \u2013 someone to tell your troubles to, someone who \u201cgets\u201d you, who \u201csees\u201d you, who is happy to listen to you. Yet one out of four of us have no confidant outside of the family.  Another one out of four have no confidant at all.</p>", "<p>Think about that: Half of all Americans have no close friendships.</p>", "<p>Loneliness is associated with addiction, depression, anxiety, paranoia and even suicide.  It has become clich\u00e9 to hear neighbors describe a mass shooter as \u201ca loner.\u201d Science has been able to observe the effects of loneliness even at the cellular level, although how it happens is not yet understood.  This, however, is well understood: not only do we need human connection to be whole, we need it just to stay alive.</p>", "<p>Let me be clear, spending time alone is not the problem.  Solitude is not loneliness.  Solitude is delicious and necessary.  It nourishes peacefulness and creativity. Solitude recharges the batteries\u2026which are then able to connect.</p>", "<p>What can be done about the epidemic of loneliness?  Is loneliness simply the price we pay for a culture of individualism? Or can we find a way to balance autonomy and connection?  I believe we can.

If you\u2019re fortunate enough to belong to a religious community, you know its many benefits \u2014 fellowship, mutual aid, spiritual connection and worship, to name a few.   Perhaps the greatest spiritual gift is the opportunity for self-examination that supports moral change and personal growth.

Only when that truth was faced could the institution begin to change, its victims begin to heal.</p>", "<p>What happens when mass murderers arise from within religious communities?  Let\u2019s see how two communities responded.</p>", "<p>Seung-Hui Cho, a student at Virginian Polytechnic Institute went on a shooting rampage that left 32 people dead and 17 wounded. His community was devastated by sorrow and shame. The Korean Central Presbyterian Church in Centreville, Virginia, is racially and culturally distinctive, and as a vulnerable minority, they worried about the risk of reprisals.  So they protected themselves with additional security.</p>", "<p>But fear of retaliation did not dominate their response.  It did not stop there.  It proceeded through self-examination.</p>", "<p>Although Cho had been clearly mentally ill, the community questioned what it might have done to help him and his family earlier.  What support or intervention might have prevented his massacre, they wondered.   Some of their religious leaders called on the community to participate in a 32-day fast, one day for each victim, for repentance.  Theirs was a truly religious response.</p>", "<p>Compare that to the Muslim community\u2019s response to the San Bernadino mass shooting that left 14 people dead and 22 seriously injured.  The murderers were a couple, Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik, strictly religious Muslims who attended a local mosque.</p>", "<p>How did the leadership of the American Muslim community respond?   They strongly condemned the murders \u2026 and then changed the subject to their fear of reprisals.  Full stop.</p>", "<p>With a now-familiar script orchestrated by CAIR (Council on American-Islamic Relations), the media are led to focus on the subject of potential threat to the U.S. Muslim community rather than the actual threat of violence from radical, extremist Muslims.  The script has various ways of deflecting responsibility away from Islam and the Muslim community.  One is the bogeyman of Islamophobia.</p>", "<p>Muslim leaders have it wrong when they project \u201cIslamophobia\u201d onto the general public.</p>", "<p>The real \u201cIslamophobia\u201d is the Muslim community leaders\u2019 fearful aversion to looking inside themselves. As violence continues to arise from within the Muslim community, can they still close our eyes and say \u201cit\u2019s a few bad apples,\u201d or is it time to examine the barrel?</p>", "<p>Following the initial condemnation of violence, the discussion was dominated by denial and minimization, expressed with an undertone of self-pity and a sense of victimization, as in, \u201cWhy do they focus on Islam?  Most mass shooters in the U.S. have not been Muslim!\u201d  The Oklahoma City bomber, Timothy McVeigh, is a favorite reference in this argument.</p>", "<p>The verbiage is all about deflection:</p>", "<p>\u2022 Deflect \u2014 \u201cIslamophobia.\u201d</p>", "<p>\u2022 Deflect \u2014 \u201cWe\u2019re afraid of retaliators.\u201d</p>", "<p>\u2022 Deflect \u2014 \u201cWhat about other murderers?\u201d</p>", "<p>Those who represent the Muslim community often use subtle and sophisticated means to deflect from the need for self-examination.</p>", "<p>Two of these techniques were skillfully demonstrated in the recent PBS interview of Manal Omar, acting vice-president for the Middle East and Africa Center at the United States Institute of Peace (USIP).</p>", "<p>Asked to respond to President Obama\u2019s statement about the need for the Muslim community to take more responsibility, Mr. Omar replied, \u201cI\u2019m worried about putting all that responsibility on the Muslim community.  Absolutely everyone must play a role if we are to combat violent extremism.  It can\u2019t just be the Muslims, we need everyone.\u201d</p>", "<p>But if \u201ceveryone\u201d is responsible, then no one in particular is responsible.  Diffusion of responsibility prevents self-examination.  Reframing the issue impedes self-examination, too. Every listener knows what \u201cradical Islamic terrorism\u201d means.  In contrast, \u201cviolent extremism\u201d is an abstract concept with no particular address.  The problem becomes fuzzy; the responsibility vague.</p>", "<p>The <a href=\"/topics/roman-catholic-church/\">Catholic Church</a> needed an outsider to force it to face itself.  The Korean-American Christian community had the courage do it on its own.  Self-examination is now urgently needed in the Muslim community.</p>", "<p>The rich religious tradition of Islam is unequivocally in favor of soul-searching self-examination.  In our phone conversation, Omer Salem, who holds advanced degrees from both Yale University Divinity School and AlAzhar University, Cairo, Egypt, explained the four-step process available to a Muslim who has harmed someone, which also applies to the community that enabled or participated in harming, as follows:</p>", "<p>\u2022 Remorse.</p>", "<p>\u2022 Repent to Allah.</p>", "<p>\u2022 Resolve to change the behavior.</p>", "<p>\u2022 Make amends /restitution and ask forgiveness.

His community was devastated by sorrow and shame. The Korean Central Presbyterian Church in Centreville, Virginia, is racially and culturally distinctive, and as a vulnerable minority, they worried about the risk of reprisals.  So they protected themselves with additional security.</p>", "<p>But fear of retaliation did not dominate their response.  It did not stop there.  It proceeded through self-examination.</p>", "<p>Although Cho had been clearly mentally ill, the community questioned what it might have done to help him and his family earlier.  What support or intervention might have prevented his massacre, they wondered.   Some of their religious leaders called on the community to participate in a 32-day fast, one day for each victim, for repentance.  Theirs was a truly religious response.</p>", "<p>Compare that to the Muslim community\u2019s response to the San Bernadino mass shooting that left 14 people dead and 22 seriously injured.  The murderers were a couple, Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik, strictly religious Muslims who attended a local mosque.</p>", "<p>How did the leadership of the American Muslim community respond?   They strongly condemned the murders \u2026 and then changed the subject to their fear of reprisals.  Full stop.</p>", "<p>With a now-familiar script orchestrated by CAIR (Council on American-Islamic Relations), the media are led to focus on the subject of potential threat to the U.S. Muslim community rather than the actual threat of violence from radical, extremist Muslims.  The script has various ways of deflecting responsibility away from Islam and the Muslim community.  One is the bogeyman of Islamophobia.</p>", "<p>Muslim leaders have it wrong when they project \u201cIslamophobia\u201d onto the general public.</p>", "<p>The real \u201cIslamophobia\u201d is the Muslim community leaders\u2019 fearful aversion to looking inside themselves.

That is a breathtaking repudiation of Hillary  Clinton and a  powerful demand for the politics of change.</p>", "<p>The third big winner  was the <a href=\"/topics/republican-party/\">Republican Party</a>.

With  Senator Tim Scott\u2019s endorsement coming after South Carolina Congressman  Trey Gowdy\u2019s recent endorsement, Mr. Rubio may go into that state in a  surprisingly good position.</p>", "<p>Mr. Rubio gained significantly from  the same pattern that helped John Edwards in Iowa in 2004 and Rick  Santorum in 2012. When Iowans see two candidates fighting, they often  shift to the nice, pleasant third person who is being positive. This  often happens in the last weekend before the vote. While Mr. Rubio was  critical and sometimes tough on his opponents, his message is distinctly  positive and optimistic.</p>", "<p>Meanwhile, the biggest loser was Hillary Clinton.</p>", "<p>Three  months ago, she was far ahead of <a href=\"/topics/bernie-sanders/\">Bernie Sanders</a>. She had a chance to  isolate him as a wacky, hard-left socialist with impossible proposals.  Suddenly she discovered that 43 percent of Iowa Democrats liked  socialism. Then she discovered that young people, by more than six to  one, preferred <a href=\"/topics/bernie-sanders/\">Bernie</a> over her. Then she found out that <a href=\"/topics/bernie-sanders/\">Bernie</a> was  raising more money than Obama did in 2008 and that his contributions  were $27 on average, so he could go back to his supporters again and  again for more money. Mrs. Clinton, on the other hand, has been raising a  large portion of her money from rich people who give the maximum amount  and can\u2019t give again. She is presently going to be dependent on her  SuperPAC to run most of the advertising on behalf of her campaign. That  is very expensive, it is less effective, and it will open her up to  further attacks from <a href=\"/topics/bernie-sanders/\">Mr. Sanders</a> for being the candidate of the very  rich.</p>", "<p>Mrs. Clinton will be drawn further and further to the left  to counter <a href=\"/topics/bernie-sanders/\">Sanders</a>. She will also be physically and psychologically  exhausted by a long primary campaign. <a href=\"/topics/bernie-sanders/\">Mr. Sanders</a> did well enough to  raise even more money and cheerfully continues to campaign.</p>", "<p>Donald  Trump also lost some ground in Iowa. He had an opportunity to win the  state and potentially lock up the nomination. He did not spend enough on  the traditional ground game with field organizers and precinct  organizations. He also skipped the final debate (the only debate in  Iowa) and created a vacuum in which Marco Rubio could rise.</p>", "<p>Mr.  Trump did, however, give a very appropriate concession speech and he was  gracious and positive. He left for New Hampshire with a campaign that  still has great potential.</p>", "<p>The other loser was Jeb Bush, whose  SuperPAC spent $14.9 million (the most of any <a href=\"/topics/republican-party/\">GOP</a> candidate) and won him  5,196 votes in Iowa.

Much has been made of the irony that global leaders are gathering in France \u2014 just weeks after a massive terror attack \u2014 to discuss the threat of greenhouse gas emissions.  One would think that Europe would be promoting a \u201cParis Agreement\u201d as a world consensus on battling the rise of radical Islamic jihadism rather than battling the rise of the world\u2019s temperature.</p>", "<p>Imagine how radically different the world would be if the discussion in Morocco in 1943 at the Casablanca Conference had been centered on the weather rather than the doctrine of unconditional surrender.</p>", "<p>Last week, President Obama confidently stated that the conference would be a \u201crebuke\u201d to the terrorists \u2014 as if jihadists will somehow be shamed into stopping their malicious acts because the world\u2019s peddlers of eco-guilt are holding a conference to ease their collective conscience.</p>", "<p>Can any rational world leader actually believe that climate change is the worst problem this world is facing?  How is that even possible?  ISIS runs amok, and the refugee crisis in Syria has reached epic proportions; but apparently, this pales in comparison to the focus on carbon dioxide emissions.</p>", "<p>What should frighten thinking Americans everywhere is that the goal of the conference is to achieve a \u201cbinding and universal\u201d agreement from all nations to work to reduce emissions.  It is assumed that about 20 nations, including the U.S., will agree to double the amount of spending related to \u201cclean\u201d energy over a five-year period.  For us, that would represent billions of dollars.  Billions. And that\u2019s of course in addition to the billions we have already spent.</p>", "<p>In the period from 2010-13 alone, the U.S. Treasury almost doubled spending on renewable energy grants from $4.5 billion to $8.2 billion; and tax subsidies for \u201cgreen energy\u201d grew from $1.9 billion to $3.8 billion during the same time, according the EIA.</p>", "<p>Mr. Obama said he was \u201coptimistic about what we can achieve because I\u2019ve already seen America take incredible strides these past seven years.\u201d  As our dependence on renewable energy is estimated to have grown a paltry 1.7% over that period of time, one could only imagine he is referring to the strides in spending.</p>", "<p>Reality check: Sunday night\u2019s debt clock stood at $18.7 trillion.  What will be the source of this money?</p>", "<p>The most recent jobs report showed absolutely no growth in the manufacturing sector.  But instead of a focused effort to rebuild this crucial sector of our economy, the president is likely to agree to a pledge of cutting emissions from 28 percent to 26 percent in the next 15 years.</p>", "<p>And don\u2019t forget a $3 billion pledge to the U.N. Green Climate Fund to help poorer countries deal with climate change.</p>", "<p>Dare I be so bold as to ask for the page and verse citation of the U.S. Constitution that gives the authority to the U.S. president to spend any of this money or sign on to these types of agreements?  Congressional Republicans, along with a number of their Democrat counterparts, have sent a clear signal that any agreement signed onto by the president will be non-binding.  Mr. Obama himself has steered clear of using the phrase \u201ctreaty\u201d, presumably demonstrating enough respect for the Constitution to know that a president only has the power to make treaties \u201cby and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate \u2026 provided two-thirds of the Senators present concur.\u201d (Article II, Section 2.)</p>", "<p>Who will come to defense of America on this issue?  Why must we agree to shoulder so much of the financial load of this agreement?  According to an EU database, the facts show that the U.S. carbon dioxide emissions have grown only slightly from 1990 to 2013, and our per capita emissions have actually decreased in the same period!  Compare that to China, whose emissions have nearly tripled in both categories.</p>", "<p>It has become quite obvious that any world discussion on climate change advances becomes synonymous with what can only be seen as economic sanctions for the United States.  For once, global leaders have found a morally acceptable and universally popular way to level the world\u2019s economic playing field.  With chants of \u201cSave the Planet\u201d they assume the moral high ground to make financial demands on producing nations in the forms of carbon tax and funding for underdeveloped nations.</p>", "<p>In few ways has the epic struggle between the makers and the takers played out more obviously on a world stage.</p>"], "article_author": ["Amy Clark"]}

According to the TransCanada website, the pipeline would have the capacity to transport up to 830,000 barrels a day to refineries in both the Midwest and the Gulf Coast.  By the State Department\u2019s own admission, the pipeline represents the promise of 42,000 jobs \u2014 both direct and indirect.  In 2013, it even released a \u201cDraft Supplementary Environmental Impact Statement\u201d that said \u201cthere would be no significant impacts to most resources along the proposed Project route.\u201d</p>", "<p>For a president whose only legacy thus far has been promoting disastrous policy \u2014 both domestically (Obamacare, anyone?) and in foreign affairs (how about the Iran nuclear deal?) \u2014 here was an opportunity to create a lasting legacy of jobs, economic growth and energy independence.  Yet what we witnessed in the press conference was the most recent example of how \u201cclimate change\u201d concerns now trump solid policy decisions.</p>", "<p>This was a classic case of liberal hypocrisy.  Quoting Secretary of State John Kerry\u2019s assertion that the project \u201cwould not serve the national interests of the United States,\u201d the president then outlined his reasons for supporting Mr. Kerry\u2019s assessment.  He stated it would not make a meaningful contribution to our economy, suggesting that if Congress wanted to create jobs, federal lawmakers should pass legislation to do so.  He also claimed that the pipeline would not create energy independence for the nation, and insinuated that it wasn\u2019t necessary as gas prices are already low.</p>", "<p>These assertions demonstrate both flawed economic logic and a fundamental mischaracterization of crude market trends over time.  Any Texan over the age of reason can tell you that oil prices will rise and oil prices will fall.  Many factors contribute to this \u2014 not the least of which are alternative exploration (i.e. fracking) or events in the Middle East.  But for me, the most troubling aspect of his reasoning is the willingness to throw away a private sector/manufacturing-employer/bird-in-the-hand, while expecting Congress to drive the job-creation train via legislation.</p>", "<p>The rest of his brief press conference was devoted to his perceived environmental achievements, as he again demanded that America \u201cmust transition to a clean energy economy.\u201d  Of course, the clean energy \u201cinvestments\u201d referred to by the president often equate to subsidies, putting the government in direct competition with private enterprise rather than promoting market-based solutions to our energy needs.</p>", "<p>Concluding with a reference to our nation as a global leader on climate change, he declared that the Keystone pipeline would \u201cundercut\u201d this position.</p>", "<p>This project has been subjected to intense regulatory scrutiny every step of the way.  So why the decision now?  Is it a coincidence that pipeline promoters had just days ago asked to put their application on hold, presumably in hopes of holding out for a new administration which might be more favorable to the project?</p>", "<p>Perhaps the more likely reason for the president\u2019s sudden decision was a move to increase \u201ccredibility\u201d for the U.S. at the upcoming climate change meeting in Paris this month.</p>", "<p>The real news flash from this announcement is how the Democratic Party has completely launched itself over the cliff of economic reality.  With this press conference, the president has symbolically divorced himself from the millions of blue-collar workers in solidly blue states who had once represented a very important component of the Left\u2019s base.  Previously courted by Democrat candidates who would advocate for manufacturing projects within their districts, these hard-working Americans have now been left out in the cold by their own party.</p>", "<p>Deciding once and for all to put the notion of \u201csaving the planet\u201d over the economic interests of people, Mr. Obama has sent a clear signal that climate change ideology is now the primary concern of his Democratic Party.

My late husband was the recipient of that letter.  It was his intentions to answer, however, other things got in the way.  His health deteriorated slowly away until on November 23, 1989 he met his Lord.<br>Now here it is some years later, I am cleaning out some boxes of stored things and I find your letter.  I wish to thank you for your interest in thanking those that have in some way preserved our Nation for us.  Ralph was some eleven years older than I, therefore he was in the service while I was just a girl about your age.  He never talked much about the war, only the Island he was on, the trees, fruit, and way of life.  He learned many things to do with his mind and hands.  He had an exceptional memory, I regret   only that I didn\u2019t capture some of his knowledge in some way.  Perhaps I did, his only child, a daughter now lives in Lancaster\u2026<br>Amy, by now your brother has made some mark in this world and I sincerely hope that is what he truly wanted to do with his life.  You, by now should be very close to working on your life.  You may be at a point in your life to make decisions.  What ever they may be, make them with your heart and be true.  Life is not a bowl of roses without thorns, but we can make it a little better, because we try to soften the thorns.<br>Amy, most likely you are right, you may never take part in a war, but you have courage, never think for a moment that you don\u2019t.  Courage is found in everyday life, when we are called upon.<br>May God Bless and keep you.  Thank you again for your thoughtfulness.  Our paths may never meet, but you have reached out and touched someone.<br>Sincerely,\u2028 Janie (wife of Ralph, a Navy man of World War II)</p>", "<p>**For the record, my brother did go on to serve in the war in Iraq.

The Democrat turnout collapsed from 240,000 in 2008 to 171,000  this year. That is a decline of almost 30 percent.</p>", "<p>The chairman  of the Iowa <a href=\"/topics/republican-party/\">GOP</a>, Jeff Kaufmann, has made the point that several thousand  voters switched to the <a href=\"/topics/republican-party/\">Republican Party</a> in the last few weeks.  Virtually none went the other way.</p>", "<p>The <a href=\"/topics/republican-party/\">GOP</a> also won in a special way almost no one in the news media has picked up on.</p>", "<p>Christina  Martin (my former press secretary and an experienced observer of  politics) noted that \u201cIn Iowa, one of the whitest states in the country,  60 percent of the Republican caucus votes went to two Cubans and an  African-American. Who is the <a href=\"/topics/republican-party/\">party</a> of inclusion and who is the <a href=\"/topics/republican-party/\">party</a> of  old white people now?!\u201d</p>", "<p>The fourth winner was Marco Rubio. With  Senator Tim Scott\u2019s endorsement coming after South Carolina Congressman  Trey Gowdy\u2019s recent endorsement, Mr. Rubio may go into that state in a  surprisingly good position.</p>", "<p>Mr. Rubio gained significantly from  the same pattern that helped John Edwards in Iowa in 2004 and Rick  Santorum in 2012. When Iowans see two candidates fighting, they often  shift to the nice, pleasant third person who is being positive. This  often happens in the last weekend before the vote. While Mr. Rubio was  critical and sometimes tough on his opponents, his message is distinctly  positive and optimistic.</p>", "<p>Meanwhile, the biggest loser was Hillary Clinton.</p>", "<p>Three  months ago, she was far ahead of <a href=\"/topics/bernie-sanders/\">Bernie Sanders</a>. She had a chance to  isolate him as a wacky, hard-left socialist with impossible proposals.  Suddenly she discovered that 43 percent of Iowa Democrats liked  socialism. Then she discovered that young people, by more than six to  one, preferred <a href=\"/topics/bernie-sanders/\">Bernie</a> over her. Then she found out that <a href=\"/topics/bernie-sanders/\">Bernie</a> was  raising more money than Obama did in 2008 and that his contributions  were $27 on average, so he could go back to his supporters again and  again for more money. Mrs. Clinton, on the other hand, has been raising a  large portion of her money from rich people who give the maximum amount  and can\u2019t give again. She is presently going to be dependent on her  SuperPAC to run most of the advertising on behalf of her campaign. That  is very expensive, it is less effective, and it will open her up to  further attacks from <a href=\"/topics/bernie-sanders/\">Mr. Sanders</a> for being the candidate of the very  rich.</p>", "<p>Mrs. Clinton will be drawn further and further to the left  to counter <a href=\"/topics/bernie-sanders/\">Sanders</a>. She will also be physically and psychologically  exhausted by a long primary campaign. <a href=\"/topics/bernie-sanders/\">Mr. Sanders</a> did well enough to  raise even more money and cheerfully continues to campaign.</p>", "<p><a href=\"?page=2\" onclick=\"_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'Pagination', 'StoryContinues', '/news/2016/feb/2/newt-gingrich-iowa-lessons/']);trackclick(this);\"><em>Story Continues \u2192</em></a></p>"], "article_author": ["Newt Gingrich"]}

And anti-Semitism was almost exclusively responsible for the 30 percent increase in \u201cracist acts\u201d between 2013 and 2014, according to numbers cited in the report from the French Ministry of the Interior.</p>", "<p>And more than 80 percent of incidents are not reported, according to one European Union survey.</p>", "<p>Most incidents are verbal threats and insults made against Jews, but they also include physical assaults as well as graffiti and vandalism against Jewish stores and synagogues.</p>", "<p>The most notable acts of violence in recent years were a 2012 shooting at a Jewish school in Toulouse that killed four and was linked to Islamic extremism and anti-Semitism, and the shooting of four hostages at a kosher supermarket in Paris in January of 2015.</p>", "<p>Jews have a long history in <a href=\"/topics/france/\">France</a> having settled there since the 6th century and enjoying citizenship since the time of Napoleon. Yet today\u2019s hate crimes seem to have a chilling effect.</p>", "<p>The number of French Jews emigrating to Israel spiked to 3,295 in 2013 and more than doubled to 7,230 in 2014, according to the Jewish Agency for Israel which monitors the numbers of Jewish immigrants from <a href=\"/topics/france/\">France</a>. Previously the annual figure was around one to two thousand.</p>", "<p>Jews who stay in <a href=\"/topics/france/\">France</a> are more afraid to wear public symbols and identifications of their faith. Parents are transferring their children from public schools to private schools to escape discrimination and harassment, and many teachers have reported critical or outright anti-Semitic responses from students when they teach about the Holocaust or Jewish history.</p>", "<p>The commissioner of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, Dr. Katrina Lantos Swett, told CNA/EWTN News last March of the fear in the Jewish communities that she witnessed during a visit to <a href=\"/topics/france/\">France</a>. Many Jewish parents \u201cdon\u2019t see a Jewish future\u201d for their children there, she said. The government has stationed security outside of Jewish buildings and synagogues to protect them from vandalism and violence.</p>", "<p>The decline of the situation is largely due to two major factors: the rise of the far-right National Front political party, and the resentment of disenfranchised immigrant and minority groups, the report said.</p>", "<p>The National Front has soared into the mainstream of French politics recently, winning first place in the 2014 elections and the first round of the 2015 regional elections in November. The party \u201crallies its supporters around animosity towards Muslims, Roma, foreigners, and migrants,\u201d the report stated, and although leaders have tried to cleanse it of anti-Semitic and Holocaust-denying rhetoric, its platform \u201cstill contains positions on ritual animal slaughter and public subsidies that are discriminatory against Jews as well as Muslims.\u201d</p>", "<p>Many members of its base still hold anti-Semitic views. In two French surveys \u2013 a 2014 report on tolerance submitted to the French government, and a report by a French think tank \u2013 over half of the respondents who supported the National Front espoused anti-Semitism.</p>", "<p>Outside of the party, many immigrants and descendants of immigrants have been unable to assimilate into the societal mainstream and may harbor resentment toward Jews who they mistakenly see as controlling wealth and power.</p>", "<p>\u201cFrench Muslims, immigrants, and French citizens of Middle Eastern, North African, or Sub-Saharan African heritage, especially those living and attending school in marginalized areas, experience prejudice and suffer from hate crimes as well as official and private discrimination,\u201d the report noted.</p>", "<p>Many young people in these communities suffer a lack of education and social mobility and are exposed to extremist views on the internet that \u201cbombard\u201d them with anti-Semitism.</p>", "<p>Some of the most common anti-Semitic beliefs are that the Jews control too much power or too much wealth, the report noted, and some of the other less common attitudes are that the Jews \u201cuse the Holocaust to their advantage,\u201d and are more loyal to the state of Israel than <a href=\"/topics/france/\">France</a>.</p>", "<p>The discrimination is concentrated more among the elderly, poor, less educated, and more religious, the report added, and is more likely to occur during heightened Israeli-Palestinian conflict and right after terror attacks or well-publicized anti-Semitic hate crimes.</p>", "<p>However, even some French \u201cobservant Catholics\u201d have shown anti-Semitic attitudes, according to a 2014 survey by a French think tank FONDAPOL cited in the report. Twenty-two percent of practicing Catholics surveyed said there too many Jews in <a href=\"/topics/france/\">France</a>, while 16 percent of all those surveyed answered that way.</p>", "<p>According to the report, the U.S. must speak out against the rise of anti-Semitism but should also refrain from aggravating the marginalization that many groups currently experience in <a href=\"/topics/france/\">France</a>.

Right now, it\u2019s looking rather bleak.  We live in a country where the First Amendment is under attack by the very institutions created to promote higher-learning and free thought.

Why is \u201cprogressive\u201d the default mode in our schools?</p>", "<p>We live in a country where Obamacare has been a disaster since its inception.  Despite the Obama Administration\u2019s best efforts to make the American people think otherwise, health insurance still does not equal health care \u2014 not in any variation of fuzzy math used to justify the march toward a single-payer system.  The Affordable Care Act has proved to be anything but affordable or caring\u2014leaving thousands of employers stuck between a rock and a hard place.

As long as our Constitution still stands, and we elect leaders who are willing to remain vigilant to threats against it, the state of our Union will be free.</p>", "<p>What is equally as true about the state of the Union is that there is still reason to believe that this ship can be turned around and the course of our country righted.  In 301 days, we have the opportunity to elect a president bold enough to address the real problems facing the nation, and with enough integrity to be honest with the American people.  Only 301 days remain to work for candidates who seek to decrease the size of government, lower taxes, and promote liberty and opportunity for the people of this nation.  With our nation deriving its just powers from the consent of the governed, whether or not we choose to admit it, the State of the Union ultimately falls on all of our shoulders.</p>", "<p>It\u2019s a responsibility we can shirk no longer.</p>"], "article_author": ["Amy Clark"]}

Sean Duffy, a white Republican from rural Wisconsin, lambasted black members of Congress for failing to decry these high abortion numbers. The next day, Rep. Gwen Moore, a black Democrat from Milwaukee, fired back - accusing Duffy and his GOP colleagues of caring about black children only before they are born.</p>", "<p>In Missouri, a white GOP state legislator, Rep. Mike Moon, introduced a \u201cpersonhood\u201d bill that would effectively outlaw all abortions, and titled it the All Lives Matter Act. Abortion-rights activists were indignant, saying Moon was provocatively co-opting the Black Lives Matter slogan that has been used to convey concern about the deaths of unarmed blacks in encounters with police.</p>", "<p>The disputes have drawn attention to abortion\u2019s racial demographics just ahead of Friday\u2019s annual March for Life in <a href=\"/topics/washington-dc/\">Washington, D.C.</a>, a gathering of activists to mark the anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s 1973 Roe v.

While blacks comprise 13 percent of the population, black women account for more than 30 percent of the estimated 1 million abortions performed annually in the U.S.</p>", "<p>Over the years, some anti-abortion activists have attributed this phenomenon to black communities being \u201ctargeted\u201d by abortion providers with the aim of curtailing the black population. Abortion-rights supporters reject this assertion, and say the high black abortion rate reflects the impact of poverty and lack of access to effective contraception.</p>", "<p>Duffy tapped into this debate in his remarks on the House floor earlier this month.</p>", "<p>\u201cMy friends, liberals, Congressional Black Caucus members, they talk about fighting for the defenseless and the hopeless and the downtrodden, but there is no one more hopeless and voiceless than an unborn baby,\u201d Duffy said. \u201cBut their silence is deafening.

In order to properly prepare for the cold, in all aspects \u2014 mentally, emotionally, actuality \u2014 let\u2019s debunk some chilly and frosty myths.</p>", "<p><strong>Dr. Nina\u2019s What You Need to Know:  Busting Cold Weather Myths</strong></p>", "<p><strong>Cold air makes me sick\u2026MYTH!</strong><br>Most of us can remember being told to put on a jacket or wear a hat before going out in the cold so we do not get sick. This myth is a tough one to bust. But science has shown that cold weather does not cause us to \u201ccatch a cold\u201d by somehow weakening our body\u2019s immune system.</p>", "<p>There are a few reasons we see an uptick in illnesses during the winter months. First, we are more likely to stay indoors and in close contact with others making it easier for germs to jump from one person to the next. Second, central heating not only dries the air but also our nasal passages. Viruses are able to spread more readily through the dry air and enter into our bodies when our nose is dry and has microscopic breaks.</p>", "<p><strong>I should not exercise in the cold\u2026MYTH!</strong><br>Let\u2019s not store away our running shoes with our summer wardrobe. Studies have shown that we burn more calories when exercising in the cold because we utilize fuel in order to warm ourselves. Additionally, exercising boosts endorphins\u2014our body\u2019s natural \u201cfeel good\u201d molecules\u2014which can help fight off those winter blues.</p>", "<p>But before taking a jog let\u2019s make sure that we do a warm up first. I once read that our muscles and joints are like rubber bands. If they sit around unused and in the cold, they are more likely to be tight and constricted and incur an injury; they are more likely to \u201csnap.\u201d</p>", "<p>And don\u2019t forget to dress the part, for the cold weather. Layering our clothing can help us peel them off as we get warm, and reapply as needed.</p>", "<p><strong>Allergies go away in the winter\u2014MYTH and TRUTH!!</strong><br>Those who suffer from indoor allergens, may see their symptoms get worse. The cold weather makes it more likely that our pets will stay indoors, that we will shut those windows and not get fresh air, and that certain molds will thrive. However, those who suffer from pollen allergies may see their symptoms improve.</p>", "<p><strong>I can skip the sunscreen in the winter\u2014MYTH!</strong><br>Much like the U.S. Postal Service\u2019s motto, \u201cNeither snow nor rain nor heat\u201d stop the sun from delivering harmful ultraviolet rays. So let\u2019s not allow the freezing cold fool us. During the winter months, we are closer to the sun and, consequently, are exposed to more harmful rays. Additionally, ice and snow are great at reflecting harmful ultraviolet rays. This means we can get a double dose of exposure (from the sun and then again from the reflection off the ground). Let\u2019s not forget to apply broad-spectrum sunscreen at a minimal SPF of 30.</p>", "<p><strong>Dry skin is just an annoyance\u2014MYTH!</strong><br>When skin becomes dry, it can result in small cracks that serve as passageways for germs to enter the body. To avoid this, experts recommend moisturizing at least twice a day\u2014after showering and before bedtime. Because our hands are more prone to drying and cracking, keep lotion in our bags or at our desks, in the car and next to the soap in the bathroom so we can moisturize throughout the day.</p>", "<p><strong>Eating chicken soup helps you fight off that cold\u2014TRUTH!</strong><br>Chicken soup may not only be good for our soul, but also our colds. However, it is important that we use real chicken broth that has been made from chicken bones because the marrow contains B vitamins, and the bone\u2019s other components contain calcium, magnesium, and zinc. These vitamins and minerals stimulate our immune system, in particular our white blood cells to fight off those pesky germs. Additionally, the warmth of the soup can help reduce sinus and throat pain.</p>", "<p><strong>Cold temps cause hair loss\u2014MYTH!</strong><br>Mother nature gave us hair to keep us warm. Thus, it makes sense that we moult depending on the temperature: hold onto our hair more tightly during the winter months and lose it in the summer. Not convinced? Look at our dogs and cats to see how thick their fur gets in the winter.</p>", "<p>\u201cSunshine is delicious, rain is refreshing, wind braces us up, snow is exhilarating; there is really no such thing as bad weather, only different kinds of good weather,\u201d shared John Ruskin. So, as temperatures dip, let\u2019s warm our hearts and homes by snuggling and cuddling with loved ones, roasting marshmallows in front of the fireplace, and feasting with family and loved ones.</p>"], "article_author": ["Dr. Nina Radcliff"]}

I think you should expect them to be mature and to behave, and I think that\u2019s what it means to treat someone like a grown-up, among other things, although the phrase to treat someone like a grown-up is ambiguous.</p>", "<p>It\u2019s not about the abdication of authority.</p>", "<p>For example, it\u2019s common now in this country to find parents who are chauffeuring their 8-year-old or 12-year-old around to various schools, among families that are choosing a school, and the parent functions as educational consultant. The parent makes a recommendation, but the child makes the final decision. I know of cases where the kid was clearly making the wrong decision and the parents knew it but nevertheless felt completely powerless to overrule their child. The child is the one who suffers.</p>", "<p><a href=\"/topics/american-academy-of-pediatrics/\">AP</a>: What are some other examples?</p>", "<p><a href=\"/topics/leonard-sax/\">Sax</a>: The same is true with regard to a cellphone in the bedroom.

You take the device at night and you put it in the charger, which stays in the parents\u2019 bedroom.

In earlier centuries, generations of monks tucked candles in the niches and prayed in the cool chapel. The Greek letters chi and rho, representing the first two letters of Christ\u2019s name, were carved near the entrance.</p>", "<p>Now satellite photos obtained exclusively by The Associated Press confirm the worst fears of church authorities and preservationists - St. Elijah\u2019s Monastery of Mosul has been completely wiped out.</p>", "<p><strong><a href=\"/multimedia/collection/only-on-ap-oldest-christian-monastery-2016-01-20/\" target=\"_blank\">PHOTOS: Only On AP: Oldest Christian monastery in Iraq is razed</a></strong></p>", "<p>In his office in exile in Irbil, Iraq, the Rev. Paul Thabit Habib, 39, stared quietly at before- and after-images of the monastery that once perched on a hillside above his hometown of Mosul. Shaken, he flipped back to his own photos for comparison.</p>", "<p>\u201cI can\u2019t describe my sadness,\u201d he said in Arabic. \u201cOur Christian history in Mosul is being barbarically leveled. We see it as an attempt to expel us from Iraq, eliminating and finishing our existence in this land.\u201d</p>", "<p>The Islamic State group, which broke from al-Qaida and now controls large parts of Iraq and Syria, has killed thousands of civilians and forced out hundreds of thousands of Christians, threatening a religion that has endured in the region for 2,000 years.  Along the way, its fighters have destroyed buildings and ruins historical and culturally significant structures they consider contrary to their interpretation of Islam.</p>", "<p>Those who knew the monastery wondered about its fate after the extremists swept through in June 2014 and largely cut communications to the area.</p>", "<p>Now, St. Elijah\u2019s has joined a growing list of more than 100 demolished religious and historic sites, including mosques, tombs, shrines and churches in Syria and Iraq. The extremists have defaced or ruined ancient monuments in Nineveh, Palmyra and Hatra. Museums and libraries have been looted, books burned, artwork crushed - or trafficked.</p>", "<p>\u201cA big part of tangible history has been destroyed,\u201d said Rev. Manuel Yousif Boji.

He is part of the Detroit area\u2019s Chaldean community, which became the largest outside Iraq after the sectarian bloodshed that followed the U.S. invasion in 2003. Iraq\u2019s Christian population has dropped from 1.3 million then to 300,000 now, church authorities say.</p>", "<p>The destruction of the monastery is a blow for U.S. troops and advisers who served in Iraq and had tried to protect and honor the site, a hopeful endeavor in a violent place and time.</p>", "<p>Suzanne Bott, who spent more than two years restoring St. Elijah\u2019s Monastery as a U.S. State Department cultural adviser in Iraq, teared up when the AP showed her the images.</p>", "<p>\u201cOh no way.

Imagery analyst Stephen Wood, CEO of Allsource Analysis, reviewed the pictures for AP and identified the date of destruction between Aug. 27 and Sept. 28, 2014. Before it was razed, images show a partially restored, 27,000-square-foot religious building. Although the roof was largely missing, it had 26 distinctive rooms including a sanctuary and chapel. One month later, \u201cthe stone walls have been literally pulverized,\u201d said Wood.</p>", "<p>\u201cBulldozers, heavy equipment, sledgehammers, possibly explosives turned those stone walls into this field of gray-white dust. They destroyed it completely,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to rebuild.\u201d</p>", "<p>The monastery, called Dair Mar Elia, is named for the Assyrian Christian monk \u2014 St. Elijah \u2014 who built it between 582 and 590 A.C. It was a holy site for Iraqi Christians for centuries, part of the Mideast\u2019s Chaldean Catholic community.</p>", "<p>In 1743, tragedy struck when as many as 150 monks who refused to convert to Islam were massacred under orders of a Persian general, and the monastery was damaged. For the next two centuries it remained a place of pilgrimage, even after it was incorporated into an Iraqi military training base and later a U.S. base.</p>", "<p>Then in 2003 St. Elijah\u2019s shuddered again - this time a wall was smashed by a tank turret blown off in battle. Iraqi troops had already moved in, dumping garbage in the ancient cistern. The U.S. Army\u2019s 101st Airborne Division took control, with troops painting over ancient murals and scrawling their division\u2019s \u201cScreaming Eagle,\u201d along with \u201cChad wuz here\u201d and \u201cI love Debbie,\u201d on the walls.</p>", "<p>A U.S. military chaplain, recognizing St. Elijah\u2019s significance, kicked the troops out and the Army\u2019s subsequent preservation initiative became a pet project for a series of chaplains who toured thousands of soldiers through the ruin.</p>", "<p>\u201cIt was a sacred place. We literally bent down physically to enter, an acquiescence to the reality that there was something greater going on inside,\u201d remembered military chaplain Jeffrey Whorton.  A Catholic priest who now works at Ft. Bragg, he had to collect himself after viewing the damage. \u201cI don\u2019t know why this is affecting me so much,\u201d he said.</p>", "<p>The U.S. military\u2019s efforts drew attention from international media outlets including the AP in 2008.

Ted Cruz for the lead in polling in Iowa, while in South Carolina <a href=\"/topics/donald-trump/\">Mr. Trump</a> holds a comfortable lead over Mr. Cruz, according to an Opinion Savvy/Augusta Chronicle poll released Monday that found him ahead by 15 percentage points.</p>", "<p>Christian voters make up the lion\u2019s share of voters in both states, according to exit polls from 2012, which found that nearly 60 percent of Iowa caucusgoers and South Carolina primary voters identified as evangelical or born-again Christian.</p>", "<p>Political handicappers say that winning those voters is key to Mr. Cruz\u2019s chances of winning the nomination.</p>", "<p><a href=\"/topics/donald-trump/\">Mr. Trump</a>, though, is trying to make inroads. The Christian Broadcasting Network reported last week that the businessman will sit down with televangelist Pat Robertson next month and speak to students at the school he founded, Regent University.

Marco Rubio appear at some point too.</p>", "<p><a href=\"/topics/donald-trump/\">Mr. Trump</a> has managed to overcome hiccups with evangelicals before.

In fact, forecasts say more than 38 million of us will board U.S. carriers this season. Today, I am addressing information from studies and research on airplane travel, having already addressed <a href=\"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/dec/9/nina-radcliff-holiday-road-trip-tips-no-1-your-own/\" target=\"_blank\">driving in passenger vehicles</a>.</p>", "<p>Airlines function as an ideal breeding ground for unwanted virus, bacteria, and other unmentionables. But not to fear. Knowing the danger zones can help us battle these critters and avoid pitfalls.</p>", "<p><strong>Dr. Nina\u2019s What You Need To Know About Keeping Clean During Airline Travel</strong></p>", "<p><strong>Why are germs an issue on airplanes?</strong><br>Between the restricted space and scores of people flying in the same cabin for long periods of time, it\u2019s not surprising that airplanes are an uber-successful breeding-zone for germs. Additionally, the air is re-circulated throughout the cabin, thereby decreasing ventilation.</p>", "<p><strong>What do germs like?</strong><br>In general, porous surfaces, such as leather and cloth, are especially inviting. Additionally, low humidity, as is often the case in an airplane cabin, can decrease our body\u2019s infection-fighting capability. Normally, our airways remain moist allowing the lining to trap germs so they cannot enter into our body. Dry air dries up mucus in our airways, and this permits germs to enter more easily.</p>", "<p><strong>What are areas of significant concern?</strong><br>\u2022 <strong> Armrests</strong>: in addition to being porous, it boasts plenty of passenger contact.<br>\u2022    <strong>Plastic tray table</strong>: while they may be intended for eating our food, they also double up as a great diaper changing station, opportunity to stash chewed gum or discarded boogers. In addition, 60 percent of tray tables have been shown to test positive for MRSA, a deadly superbug. This is in comparison to only 11 percent of surfaces in New York subways.<br>\u2022    <strong>Seat pockets</strong>: one too many passengers use this area to discard their trash (fingernail clippings, dirty diapers). In fact, it has been likened to \u201creaching into someone\u2019s purse and rummaging through their dirty tissues, and gum wrappers.\u201d Yikes!<br>\u2022    <strong>Blankets and pillows</strong>: most airlines provide fresh, washed ones each morning. However, later in the day, it is likely they have been used\u2026or drooled on.<br>\u2022 <strong> Seat belts</strong>: Porous material that is not typically cleaned, and everyone must handle and wear.<br>\u2022    <strong>Bathrooms</strong>: Swoosh! Studies have shown that the powerful flush sprays germs everywhere. And when you consider that there is one toilet available for 50-75 people, it is no surprise that it can be a danger zone.<br>\u2022 <strong> Water</strong>: Drinking from the sink or tank may be problematic. Opt for bottled water.</p>", "<p><strong>What are the airlines doing to keep airplanes clean?</strong><br>In general, airlines have gone on record that they set their own standards without regulators and give instructions to their contractors. They use chemicals approved by aircraft manufacturers and conduct their own quality-control inspections. Further reports state that crews clean the plane during the overnight stay at an airport, replacing all pillows and blankets, daily. Every 30 days or between long distance international flights, a deep cleaning occurs; and every 18-24 months, an ultra-cleaning takes place.</p>", "<p><strong>What we can do to stay a little cleaner?</strong><br>\u2022    Visit your doctor and get your flu shot. Holidays coincide with the flu season and that\u2019s why the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), recommends a yearly flu vaccine for everyone six months of age and older as the most important step you can take to stay healthy. If you\u2019re traveling abroad, find out what vaccinations you need and if any special health notices are posted on the CDC destination list.<br>\u2022    Do not travel while sick or immune-compromised (chemotherapy, bone marrow transplants, illness).<br>\u2022    Use disinfectant wipes to wipe down tray tables and bathroom surfaces. Look for ones that are effective against MRSA. Because tray tables are in close contact with our food, which we will be ingesting, dirty surfaces can provide a direct and fast track into our bodies.<br>\u2022    Spritz spray sanitizer onto seatbelts and armrests<br>\u2022    Do not use seat pockets to store items such as water bottles, personal magazines, or smart phones. Instead, use your carry-on bag.<br>\u2022    Carry 60 percent alcohol hand sanitizer and apply prior to eating, after using the restroom and intermittently.<br>\u2022    Do not walk barefoot inside the cabin<br>\u2022    In general, it is wise to avoid touching our mouths, nose or eyes with our fingers. These body parts are lined with a specialized \u201cmucus membranes\u201d that can serve as \u201cportals of entry\u201d into our body.<br>\u2022    Staying hydrated keeps our airways moist, allowing germs to get caught in mucus and prevent it from entering into our bodies.<br>\u2022    Nasal sprays hydrate our nostrils in an otherwise dry environment. When mucus membranes are moist, they can trap bacteria.<br>\u2022    Bring our own blankets<br>\u2022    Wipe down luggage</p>", "<p>Identifying pitfalls and danger zones can facilitate proper preparation and precautions that can help us combat germs and illness. As we make plans to fly \u201cover the river and woods\u201d there is plenty we can do to avoid airline germs and stay healthy during this season.  There is a great saying that \u201ctravel is the only thing you buy, that makes you richer\u201d and I agree. Enjoy!</p>"], "article_author": ["Dr. Nina Radcliff"]}

However, while we may not have 1-2 hours to dedicate to daily gym workouts, we have 24 hours in each and every day where we can incorporate more physical activity into our daily routines. And studies have shown that even short bursts of physical activity throughout the day can have a cumulative benefit, at any age.</p>", "<p><strong>Dr. Nina\u2019s What You Need To Know: To Incorporate Physical Activity Into Our Daily</strong></p>", "<p><strong>Why is physical activity important?</strong> Our bodies were meant to move. Staying active has been shown to increase our lifespan; strengthen our muscles and bones; stay at a healthy weight; sleep better; and improve our mood. And, if we do not make time for exercise we will likely have to find time for illness. A sedentary lifestyle increases our risk for obesity, heart disease, diabetes, depression, and stroke.</p>", "<p><strong>What is a sedentary lifestyle?</strong> A sedentary lifestyle is a type of lifestyle with no or irregular physical activity.</p>", "<p><strong>How can I turn sit time into fit time?</strong><br>\u2022    While watching television, pedal on a stationary bike or walk on a treadmill. Alternatively, consider doing push ups, sit ups, lifting weights (or water bottles), or doing jumping jacks during commercial breaks. One mother told me that it was a family rule to dance around when there was a commercial. If anyone was caught sitting on the couch, they were assigned an additional chore, so everyone made sure to cha-cha-cha. Another trick is to side-line the remote control and get up to change the channel.<br>\u2022    During our kid\u2019s sports games, instead of sitting, pace the sidelines.<br>\u2022    While making and returning phone calls, walk on the treadmill, stand up, move around, stretch, or practice our balance by standing on one foot at a time.</p>", "<p><strong>How can I move more at home \u2026 and save money?</strong><br>\u2022    Gardening can burn lots of calories: raking, mowing, pulling weeds, digging, and planting.<br>\u2022    Housework is no sedentary matter. Between vacuuming, sweeping, picking up things, doing laundry, or making our beds, calories are sure to be burnt.</p>", "<p><strong>What can I do when I go shopping?</strong><br>\u2022    Instead of spending 5-10 minutes looking for the closest parking spot near the front door of the store, park as far away as possible, and walk briskly to the door.<br>\u2022    While at the mall, take laps. In addition to being perfectly climate controlled (not too hot, not too cold), there is lots to see and discover.<br>\u2022    At the grocery or drug store, walk through every aisle. And if we are carrying a basket, do biceps curls and make sure to alternate arms.</p>", "<p><strong>What can I do while I am sitting in traffic or at a stoplight?</strong><br>\u2022    Core workout. Consider placing our hands against the roof of our car, pushing up with our arms, and squeezing our abs at the same time for 10 seconds. This technique can strengthen the arms, shoulders, back, and core.<br>\u2022    Crush the steering wheel. While stopped at a red light, grip the wheel at opposite ends, and try to push our hands toward each other for 3 seconds. Then try to pull your hands away from each other for 3 seconds.<br>\u2022    Stretching. Slowly rotate our neck in a circle; place our ear to our shoulder and alternate; move our chin to our chest and then straighten. Shoulder shrugs can also be performed in both the forward and backward direction.</p>", "<p><strong>What can we do to increase our physical activity during the workday?</strong><br>\u2022    Walk around or stand while brainstorming project ideas with coworkers, giving presentations, or making phone calls. And, instead of shooting an email or calling someone within the building, go visit them in person.<br>\u2022    Take the stairs instead of the elevator, whenever possible.<br>\u2022    During breaks, personify the Madagascar song \u201cI Like to Move It.\u201d Walk around or within the building, stretch, or do leg lifts or lunges. Look for creative ways to avoid spending the entire break sitting.<br>\u2022    If possible, get a stand-up desk, or a treadmill where a laptop can be secured.<br>\u2022    Measure up with a pedometer. This can help keep track of how active we are.

Research shows that more than 25 percent of resolutions are abandoned within 7 days \u2026 and within six months more than 50 percent are given up with more trailing off in the following months. So what about the small percentage that succeed with their resolution?  What helped them reach their resolve? One major reason cited is that it is vital to learn how to balance the new resolutions with our prior commitments.</p>", "<p>Resolutions involve new commitments. So along with setting realistic goals \u2013 we must sharpen our focus and make adjustments with time (or other commitments) in order to do the important \u201cactions\u201d we have resolved to do.

Let\u2019s put this \u201cto do\u201d plan in motion today, tomorrow and everyday \u2013 it will make a world of difference in our good health and well-being.</p>", "<p><strong>Dr. Nina\u2019s What You Need To Know: Realistic, Healthy \u201cTo Do\u201d Resolutions</strong></p>", "<p><strong>Food as Fuel</strong><br>Our bodies are exquisite, finely-tuned machines that will last us a lifetime. In order to support its incredible feats of walking, running, talking, thinking and more, we must provide to it the highest octane fuel. The foods we eat provide energy along with essential nutrients and vitamins that allow our body to function, grow, and regenerate. Making wise choices about what we put in our mouths\u2014everyday, every meal\u2014is a commitment to keeping our bodies in optimal condition. Let\u2019s make and keep that commitment.</p>", "<p><strong>Physical Activity</strong><br>The reasons in favor of maintaining an active lifestyle are powerful: weight control, mood booster, energizer, slayer of diseases, and enemy of insomnia. However, with our long list of things-to-do, exercising is often pushed down to the bottom of the list and, in some instances, dropped altogether. Let\u2019s aim for at least 30 minutes of physical activity, every day, and whenever possible interject movement during the day. Instead of getting on an elevator, take the stairs. While making phone calls, move around. During commercial breaks, stretch or do push-ups. The key is to move it!</p>", "<p><strong>Manage Stress</strong><br>Our body\u2019s stress response was designed to help us fight or flee from predators. Today, acute stress, when managed properly, can push us to peak performance during test taking, presentations, or playing a sport. However, when our body\u2019s stress response becomes chronic, it can be dangerous to our physical and mental health. Achieving our best overall health requires that we eliminate stress whenever possible and develop coping mechanisms to effectively recover from it. The next time we are feeling \u201cstressed out,\u201d take a deep breath (or several), laugh, listen to music, or engage in physical activity.</p>", "<p><strong>Sleep</strong><br>Quality sleep, of the right duration, is imperative to health and happiness.  It can benefit our memory and stave off dementia, as well as decrease the risk for heart disease, weight gain, diabetes, and depression. On average, the sleep duration recommendations for elementary school children is 10 hours a day, teens 9 hours a day, adults 8 hours a day, and seniors 7.5 hours a day. The general notion that older adults need less sleep is simply not true.</p>", "<p><strong>Thankfulness</strong><br>Having an attitude of gratitude is powerful.  This quality, this source, trait and state of mind\u2026 is a force that has the immense power to bring hope, heal, recognize simple pleasures, transform, and bestow bounty to our health and well-being.<br>Additionally, it has been shown that there are a number of health benefits: better sleep and eating, increased energy and lifespan, and decreased overall illness and depression. Let\u2019s reflect on how we can harness this powerful tool and lift our spirit\u2014and those we love-\u2013with daily doses and a year-round gift of appreciation, thankfulness and gratitude.</p>", "<p><strong>Giving, Kindness and Generosity</strong><br>These acts not only allow us to contribute to the lives of others and find meaning in our own lives, but science shows that it enhances our physical and mental health. Those that do for others have improved heart and mental health and are able to more effectively fight off germs. It can even add years to our lives. Whether it is holding the door open for someone, donating time, money, or belongings, or expressing gratitude to them, our actions have a ripple effect.</p>", "<p><strong>Mindfulness</strong><br>This concept or way of living means maintaining a moment-by-moment awareness of our thoughts, feelings, bodily sensations, and surrounding environment. Practicing mindfulness helps us let go of negative thoughts \u2014 past wrongs or worry about the future \u2014 while connecting to life in the present. And in doing so, we can become more aware of ourselves and our actions. Living in the moment, is living.</p>", "<p>So as we begin to ponder resolutions, let\u2019s review this healthy list and my hope is you will place these on your \u201cto do.\u201d Start today and keep it up \u2013 let\u2019s not be one of the 25 percent who gives up this first week! The choices we make today makes all the difference for the life we will lead tomorrow.

And so we\u2019re not going to do that under our state constitutional provision.\u2019\u201d</p>", "<p>The church said in its appeal to the <a href=\"/topics/8th-circuit-court-of-appeals/\">high court</a> that though the preschool itself may be part of its ministry, the grant \u2014 and the playground \u2014 were meant for purely secular purposes.</p>", "<p>\u201cSeeking to protect children from harm while they play tag and go down the slide is about as far from an \u2018essentially religious endeavor\u2019 as one can get,\u201d the church argued.</p>", "<p>That the <a href=\"/topics/us-supreme-court/\">Supreme Court</a> has agreed to hear the case has groups that promote a strict separation of church and state on high alert. The fear is that the <a href=\"/topics/8th-circuit-court-of-appeals/\">court</a> could loosen a 2004 decision that held that Washington state could exclude a college student seeking a divinity degree from its tuition-aid program.</p>", "<p>\u201cWe were surprised that the <a href=\"/topics/us-supreme-court/\">Supreme Court</a> took this case, and we are definitely concerned that the <a href=\"/topics/us-supreme-court/\">Supreme Court</a> has taken this case,\u201d said Alex Luchenitser, associate legal director for Americans United for Separation of Church and State. \u201cIt is possible that this case could erode state constitutional restrictions on the public funding of religious institutions.\u201d</p>", "<p>The case is also being watched by constitutional scholars.</p>", "<p>\u201cRegardless of outcome, the case will be one for the history books,\u201d said Noah Feldman, Harvard professor of constitutional and international law, in a column for Bloomberg View.</p>", "<p>When states began passing their own Blaine amendments in the late 1800s, a key issue was whether Catholic schools could receive public funds. More recently, courts have wrestled with whether the amendments forbid state tax dollars from being used for everything from church-run halfway houses to soup kitchens.</p>", "<p><strong>Blaine amendments</strong></p>", "<p>It\u2019s possible that the <a href=\"/topics/8th-circuit-court-of-appeals/\">high court</a> could examine the constitutionality of Blaine amendments, which go beyond the U.S. Constitution\u2019s prohibition against the establishment of a state religion. Critics contend the provisions, named after James Blaine, a House speaker and senator from Maine who ran unsuccessfully for president in 1884, are rooted in anti-Catholic animus.</p>", "<p><a href=\"?page=2\" onclick=\"_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'Pagination', 'StoryContinues', '/news/2016/jan/20/trinity-lutheran-church-v-pauley-looms-as-key-chur/']);trackclick(this);\"><em>Story Continues \u2192</em></a></p>"], "article_author": ["Valerie Richardson"]}

And interestingly, the vast majority, 91 percent, of long-distance trips are made with a personal vehicle, as compared to 5 percent to 6 percent by air, and 2 percent to 3 percent by bus, train or ship.</p>", "<p>As millions will be getting into their vehicles and behind the steering wheel, a number of organizations are embarking in high visibility campaigns to help Americans get to their holiday location safely. Motor vehicle accidents are a leading cause of injury and death in our nation. In fact, in 2013 there were an estimated 2.31 million Americans injured in motor vehicle traffic crashes and 33,782 who died. Safe driving is paramount to reaching our destinations safely and creating the wonderful memories this holiday season, and, too, all year round.</p>", "<p><strong>Dr. Nina\u2019s What You Need To Know:  Holiday Driving Safety</strong></p>", "<p><strong>Buckling up:</strong> Experts agree that this is one of the single most effective measures to protect ourselves and our passengers in a crash. In fact, it is estimated that seat belts save over 13,000 lives in motor vehicle accidents every single year!</p>", "<p>However, if the seat belt is not properly fastened, it is not effective. Make sure to place the lap belt across the hips and below the stomach. And ensure that the shoulder belt is secured across the shoulder bone, down the middle of the chest, and away from the neck. Never place the shoulder belt behind the back or under the arm. Similarly, pregnant women can place the lap belt below their belly, and the shoulder belt across their chest (between the breasts).</p>", "<p><strong>Children:</strong> The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that motor vehicle injuries are a leading cause of death among children in the United States. As parents, grandparents, and adults, there are a number of precautions we can take to decrease this tragic occurrence.</p>", "<p>Experts recommend that children should remain in the backseat at least until they are 12 years of age. Additionally, correctly used child car seats can reduce the risk of death by as much as 71 percent. However, research shows that a shocking 73 percent of car seats are not used or installed correctly! Car seats should be based on the child\u2019s age and size. Make sure to read the manufacturer\u2019s instructions as well as vehicle owner\u2019s manual to ensure that the car seat is properly installed and that the belts are appropriately positioned over the child\u2019s body.</p>", "<p>It is recommended that children should be kept in their car seat for as long as possible, meaning based on the manufacturer\u2019s height and weight requirements.  And as children get older, booster seats should be used. Research shows that they reduce the risk for serious injury by 45 percent for children 4 to 8 years of age, compared to seat belts alone.</p>", "<p><strong>Caution when changing lanes:</strong> It is important to keep lane changes to a minimum. Experts agree that cutting in front of other drivers, changing lanes too fast or not using our signals may cause an accident. And always remember to check the rearview and side mirrors, as well as do an over-the-shoulder visual check to ensure that there are no vehicles in the blind spot. Remember, studies have shown that lane changing in heavy traffic seldom saves time, but can cause accidents.</p>", "<p><strong>Distracted driving:</strong> According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), this term describes \u201cany time a driver takes their eyes off the road, hands off the wheel and mind off the primary task \u2014 driving safely.\u201d Despite the warnings, it is estimated that motorists are engaging in secondary behavior more than half of their time spent driving!</p>", "<p>Common vehicle activities that can result in distractions include texting, using a cell phone or hands-free device, eating, drinking, talking to passengers, grooming, reading (including maps), using a navigation system, watching a video and adjusting a radio or MP3 player. In fact, distracted driving is responsible for more than a million car crashes and 16 percent of fatal accidents every year. As drivers, we are carrying precious cargo. Make sure to pull over to text, eat, groom, or use a map or navigation system.</p>", "<p><strong>Driving while drowsy (sleepy, asleep, or fatigued):</strong> The National Sleep Foundation\u2019s 2005 Sleep in America poll found that 60 percent of adult drivers (168 million people) have driven a vehicle while feeling drowsy. Even more shocking is that 37 percent (103 million) stated they have actually fallen asleep at the wheel!</p>", "<p>While there is no test to confirm that you are drowsy, some signs include: difficulty focusing; frequent blinking; daydreaming; yawning; drifting from your lane; or feeling restless or irritable.</p>", "<p>To prevent driving while drowsy, drivers should ensure that they get a good night of sleep; schedule regular stops; avoid medications that can sedate you; or drive with an adult companion. If you experience drowsiness, pull over into a safe location and take a 15-20 minute nap and consider drinking a cup or two of coffee or other caffeinated beverage.</p>", "<p><strong>Drunk driving:</strong> Every year there are more than 10,000 preventable, unnecessary, tragic deaths due to drunk driving. And during the holiday season the number increases. Approximately 1,200 people die during the holiday season; this equates to nearly 45 people each day. And another 25,000 people will suffer from injuries due to drunk driving.</p>", "<p><a href=\"?page=2\" onclick=\"_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'Pagination', 'StoryContinues', '/news/2015/dec/9/nina-radcliff-holiday-road-trip-tips-no-1-your-own/']);trackclick(this);\"><em>Story Continues \u2192</em></a></p>"], "article_author": ["Dr. Nina Radcliff"]}

Before it was razed, images show a partially restored, 27,000-square-foot religious building. Although the roof was largely missing, it had 26 distinctive rooms including a sanctuary and chapel. One month later, \u201cthe stone walls have been literally pulverized,\u201d said Wood.</p>", "<p>\u201cBulldozers, heavy equipment, sledgehammers, possibly explosives turned those stone walls into this field of gray-white dust.

For the next two centuries it remained a place of pilgrimage, even after it was incorporated into an Iraqi military training base and later a U.S. base.</p>", "<p>Then in 2003 St. Elijah\u2019s shuddered again - this time a wall was smashed by a tank turret blown off in battle.

At L\u2019Enfant, for example, riders on five different lines can transfer. At Gallery Place-Chinatown handles three rail lines. Those stations, like all stations, also offer connecting Metrobus service.</p>", "<p>Yet there is a perhaps noticeable difference between L\u2019Enfant Plaza\u2019s commercial surroundings and those at Gallery Place-Chinatown.

And interestingly, the vast majority, 91 percent, of long-distance trips are made with a personal vehicle, as compared to 5 percent to 6 percent by air, and 2 percent to 3 percent by bus, train or ship.</p>", "<p>As millions will be getting into their vehicles and behind the steering wheel, a number of organizations are embarking in high visibility campaigns to help Americans get to their holiday location safely. Motor vehicle accidents are a leading cause of injury and death in our nation. In fact, in 2013 there were an estimated 2.31 million Americans injured in motor vehicle traffic crashes and 33,782 who died. Safe driving is paramount to reaching our destinations safely and creating the wonderful memories this holiday season, and, too, all year round.</p>", "<p><strong>Dr. Nina\u2019s What You Need To Know:  Holiday Driving Safety</strong></p>", "<p><strong>Buckling up:</strong> Experts agree that this is one of the single most effective measures to protect ourselves and our passengers in a crash. In fact, it is estimated that seat belts save over 13,000 lives in motor vehicle accidents every single year!</p>", "<p>However, if the seat belt is not properly fastened, it is not effective. Make sure to place the lap belt across the hips and below the stomach. And ensure that the shoulder belt is secured across the shoulder bone, down the middle of the chest, and away from the neck. Never place the shoulder belt behind the back or under the arm. Similarly, pregnant women can place the lap belt below their belly, and the shoulder belt across their chest (between the breasts).</p>", "<p><strong>Children:</strong> The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that motor vehicle injuries are a leading cause of death among children in the United States. As parents, grandparents, and adults, there are a number of precautions we can take to decrease this tragic occurrence.</p>", "<p>Experts recommend that children should remain in the backseat at least until they are 12 years of age. Additionally, correctly used child car seats can reduce the risk of death by as much as 71 percent. However, research shows that a shocking 73 percent of car seats are not used or installed correctly! Car seats should be based on the child\u2019s age and size. Make sure to read the manufacturer\u2019s instructions as well as vehicle owner\u2019s manual to ensure that the car seat is properly installed and that the belts are appropriately positioned over the child\u2019s body.</p>", "<p>It is recommended that children should be kept in their car seat for as long as possible, meaning based on the manufacturer\u2019s height and weight requirements.  And as children get older, booster seats should be used. Research shows that they reduce the risk for serious injury by 45 percent for children 4 to 8 years of age, compared to seat belts alone.</p>", "<p><strong>Caution when changing lanes:</strong> It is important to keep lane changes to a minimum. Experts agree that cutting in front of other drivers, changing lanes too fast or not using our signals may cause an accident. And always remember to check the rearview and side mirrors, as well as do an over-the-shoulder visual check to ensure that there are no vehicles in the blind spot. Remember, studies have shown that lane changing in heavy traffic seldom saves time, but can cause accidents.</p>", "<p><strong>Distracted driving:</strong> According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), this term describes \u201cany time a driver takes their eyes off the road, hands off the wheel and mind off the primary task \u2014 driving safely.\u201d Despite the warnings, it is estimated that motorists are engaging in secondary behavior more than half of their time spent driving!</p>", "<p>Common vehicle activities that can result in distractions include texting, using a cell phone or hands-free device, eating, drinking, talking to passengers, grooming, reading (including maps), using a navigation system, watching a video and adjusting a radio or MP3 player. In fact, distracted driving is responsible for more than a million car crashes and 16 percent of fatal accidents every year. As drivers, we are carrying precious cargo. Make sure to pull over to text, eat, groom, or use a map or navigation system.</p>", "<p><strong>Driving while drowsy (sleepy, asleep, or fatigued):</strong> The National Sleep Foundation\u2019s 2005 Sleep in America poll found that 60 percent of adult drivers (168 million people) have driven a vehicle while feeling drowsy. Even more shocking is that 37 percent (103 million) stated they have actually fallen asleep at the wheel!</p>", "<p>While there is no test to confirm that you are drowsy, some signs include: difficulty focusing; frequent blinking; daydreaming; yawning; drifting from your lane; or feeling restless or irritable.</p>", "<p>To prevent driving while drowsy, drivers should ensure that they get a good night of sleep; schedule regular stops; avoid medications that can sedate you; or drive with an adult companion. If you experience drowsiness, pull over into a safe location and take a 15-20 minute nap and consider drinking a cup or two of coffee or other caffeinated beverage.</p>", "<p><strong>Drunk driving:</strong> Every year there are more than 10,000 preventable, unnecessary, tragic deaths due to drunk driving. And during the holiday season the number increases. Approximately 1,200 people die during the holiday season; this equates to nearly 45 people each day. And another 25,000 people will suffer from injuries due to drunk driving.</p>", "<p>Unfortunately, many drivers incorrectly believe that they can calculate their own blood alcohol concentration (BAC). If you are going to have a drink, designate a driver. Period.</p>", "<p>Add to these to also be sure that your vehicle is properly serviced for road conditions (anticipate weather conditions) during the holidays.  Double check that  you have your trip mapped out in advance and if possible schedule travel times before or after heaviest traffic times.  If you encounter a driver that is tailgating, honking, flashing their headlights, talking on their cell phones, you can avoid a potentially dangerous situation by backing off. <a href=\"/topics/us-department-of-transportation/\">Department</a> of motor vehicles authorities remind us: You can\u2019t control another driver\u2019s behavior, but you can control your own.</p>", "<p>It is a very special time to go \u201cover the river and through the woods.\u201d Whether going shopping or to a loved one\u2019s home, with prep and wise road navigating you can leave the road-trip stress at home and enjoy your holiday travels with family and friends.</p>"], "article_author": ["Dr. Nina Radcliff"]}

Indeed, roadways and neighborhood streets remain bogged down. Still, there\u2019s another worrisome and certainly more prevailing issue that lurks among us: Roving, flash mob-like bands of teens attacking Metro riders.</p>", "<p>Much of the violence is occurring in Metrorail\u2019s central core, where stations such as L\u2019Enfant Plaza and Gallery Place-Chinatown are designated transfer points for various lines. At L\u2019Enfant, for example, riders on five different lines can transfer. At Gallery Place-Chinatown handles three rail lines. Those stations, like all stations, also offer connecting Metrobus service.</p>", "<p>Yet there is a perhaps noticeable difference between L\u2019Enfant Plaza\u2019s commercial surroundings and those at Gallery Place-Chinatown. Commuters can easily walk to the National Mall, Capitol Hill and other D.C. attractions within minutes of the L\u2019Enfant station, and tourists and other visitors can jet from the L\u2019Enfant Plaza Hotel to Reagan National Airport or cruise into the western parts of Northern Virginia on the new Silver Line. The Metro station is also enticing for quick bites, a cup of Joe or catching up on email.</p>", "<p>Gallery Place-Chinatown offers far different imagery, though. The three rail lines that converge there regularly carry schoolchildren, young and old people trekking to various judicial authorities, fast-food seekers, moviegoers, bowling enthusiasts,  museum-goers, commuters, book lovers to the main branch of the D.C. Public Library System, happy hour-goers, a plethora of sit-down restaurants, federal and D.C. office workers,  shoppers to Urban Outfitters, Bed Bath and Beyond, and other retail establishments, bicyclists, nightclub venues, and crowds drawn to sporting and entertainment events at the Verizon Center.</p>", "<p>Oh, the area is also a big draw for the panhandlers, drunks and homeless, and groups of members in the LGBT community. And drugs and other illicit goings-on.</p>", "<p>Gallery Place-Chinatown is also one of two rail stations closest to Metro\u2019s headquarters.</p>", "<p>That\u2019s a powerful mix of folks in a two-block area. And it\u2019s like that day and night \u2014 24-7-365.</p>", "<p>Recent Metro attacks include one during morning rush on Thursday, when as many as two dozen teens ganged up and brutally beat a 35-year-old man. On New Year\u2019s Day, eight teens reportedly beat three other youths. A 19-year-old was pushed around.</p>", "<p>Authorities and lawmakers are concerned. Said D.C. Council member Jack Evans to Channel 5/Fox News: \u201cIf we have roaming groups of youths attacking people, that\u2019s unacceptable and something we have to put to a stop.\u201d</p>", "<p>Well, Mr. Evans is now the head chairman in charge of Metro, having been unanimously elected this week to the board. A father of triplets, Jack is probably well-acquainted with a lasso and he\u2019ll soon learn it\u2019s needed at Metro, too.</p>", "<p>Metro is a bureaucratic boondoggle, and it needs to be fixed, because its wish list includes expansion and funding, its to-do list includes maintenance and personnel, and its must-do list includes public safety following some tragic rail incidents.</p>", "<p>Passenger safety falls onto the latter list.</p>", "<p>Metro cannot issue a blanket prohibition against people entering Metro stations or riding the rails or buses. However, its board and new general manager, Paul Wiedefeld, can become more creative regarding passenger safety.</p>", "<p>Mr. Evans should put on his \u201cdaddy jeans,\u201d get out of his sporty-orty car, and ride the buses and the rails to see the who, how and when of Metro service. The Metro reports he already has seen and those he will see don\u2019t drill deep enough. He needs to see with his own eyes who\u2019s moving in and out.</p>", "<p>He\u2019ll need that firsthand insight when the time comes to seek fare increases.

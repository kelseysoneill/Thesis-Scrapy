Will he be able to turn the anger he has whipped up against GOP elites into votes? Or will Trump's lashing of Muslims, Mexicans and his rivals turn off voters eager to select a nominee who can beat a Democrat in the fall and who fits a more traditional mold as commander in chief?</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Driving home his advantage Sunday, Trump laid into Cruz, taking exception to claims by the Texas senator that he would save President Barack Obama's signature health care law if he made it to the White House.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"Look, Ted Cruz is a total liar. I am so against Obamacare. I've been saying it for two years in my speeches, I'm going to repeal and replace Obamacare,\" Trump said on ABC's \"This Week.\" \"I don't even know where he gets this.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Trump, hoping to influence religious voters who play a key role in Iowa, went to church with his wife Melania on Sunday. The billionaire swayed in time to the hymns at First Christian Church in Council Bluffs and took communion. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">And seeking to peel away any wavering evangelicals from Cruz, Trump also linked up with Jerry Falwell, a hero of the Christian right, who endorsed him despite skepticism among some believers about the depth of Trump's faith.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">With just hours to go before the caucusing begins, Trump told TV shows Monday that he was \"a little bit nervous.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"You have to be a little bit nervous and you know I like to win and I want to win for the country I don't want to win for myself,\" Trump told ABC's \"Good Morning America.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Cruz is under intense pressure to deliver a victory on Monday night since Iowa is a state perhaps most receptive to his appeal to ideological conservatives and evangelicals. A defeat would cast doubt on his wider appeal in the delegate-rich southern states he hopes could pave the way to the nomination.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">With that in mind, Cruz on Sunday drew a firm contrast between his ideology and that of Trump.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"I do think policy differences are fair game,\" Cruz told CNN's Jake Tapper on \"State of the Union.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"He and I have very, very different views on questions like life and marriage and religious liberty. He and I have very, very different views and records on questions like health care and Obamacare and amnesty.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Making his closing argument to voters in Iowa City where he campaigned with conservative broadcaster Glenn Beck and Robertson of A&amp;E's \"Duck Dynasty,\" Cruz urged voters to ignore the media surrounding the presidential race and get out to caucus on Monday night. Evidence of his ground game was in full effect outside where volunteers spread out at long tables collecting information from voters willing to caucus tomorrow. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">He sought to differentiate himself from Trump by telling voters that if they were looking for someone who could \"maybe make some deals, I ain't your guy.\" </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Honing his argument that he is the true conservative in the race, he also implied that a vote for Trump was a risk.  </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"This is your time to make the decision for the men and women of Iowa to say we can't get fooled again,\" he said to a crowd of several hundred people who crammed into one of the exhibition halls at the state fairgrounds in Iowa City. \"The stakes are too high. We can't roll the dice.\" </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Cruz also drew fire from his other flank, as Rubio seeks at least a good third-place finish to make the case that he is a stronger alternative to Cruz and Trump than ex-Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Ohio Gov. John Kasich.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"This whole notion Ted has that he's the only conservative, I think as people learn more about his record, they'll realize what he really (is) is very calculating,\" Rubio told Tapper.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"He's always looking to take whatever position it takes to win votes or raise money, and we're not going to beat Hillary Clinton with someone that will say or do anything to get elected,\" Rubio said.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Clinton on Sunday geared up for an anxious wait to see whether the turnout machine she built while learning lessons of her 2008 caucus defeat to Obama will counter the wave of increasing enthusiasm for Sanders.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">But she was dogged by questions about the private email server she used while secretary of state, which is under investigation by the FBI to see whether any classified information was illegally compromised.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"It was not the best choice,\" Clinton said, admitting on \"This Week\" that using a government email account would have spared her political pain.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"I wouldn't be here talking to you about it,\" she said. \"I'd be talking about what people in Iowa are talking to me about, about affordable health care and jobs and rising wages and all of the concerns that are on their minds.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Sanders stuck to his vow not to use the email issue against Clinton but did accuse her campaign of turning negative against him.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"I can't keep up with what the Clinton campaign does, to be honest with you,\" Sanders said on \"State of the Union.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Still, inside Clinton's campaign, there was quiet optimism that her get-out-the-vote effort would yield victory on Monday night.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"We've had an amazing grass-roots organizing effort,\" Clinton told CNN on Saturday. \"I'm so proud of all the people who have put it together and the, literally, tens of thousands of volunteers that they've enlisted.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The Clinton campaign has 4,200 precinct captains and other precinct leaders prepared for Monday night. By Sunday, according to aides, campaign volunteers will have knocked on 125,000 doors this weekend alone.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Former President Bill Clinton, meanwhile, took aim at politicians who he implied did little more than voice the frustration of voters. It appeared to be a jab at Sanders, who has inspired legions of rank-and-file Democrats with his broadsides against Wall Street and an economy he says is skewed toward the wealthy.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"When you're angry and frustrated, the typical thing to do -- and it's so emotionally satisfying for about 30 seconds -- is to label and blame, label and blame, label and blame,\" Clinton told a historic black congregation in Des Moines.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"This church was not built on label and blame,\" he said. \"This church was built on people taking responsibility.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Obama's former political guru David Plouffe, who has endorsed Clinton, meanwhile warned on Twitter that Sanders was embracing the concept of buyer's remorse over the president.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"Sanders closing with Cornel West and embracing idea of Buyer's Remorse with @POTUS.

It was here after months of slogging across the state with little to show for it, he suddenly began to gain traction just before the 2012 caucuses. Against the odds, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/01/19/politics/iowa-caucus/\">he defeated Mitt Romney by just a handful of votes</a>. But by a twist of cruel fate, the caucus ballots were counted incorrectly and he <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/01/19/politics/iowa-caucus/\">wasn't declared winner</a> until long after it mattered to give him the bump he sorely needed. He still went on to become Romney's chief rival in the 2012 primaries, and lasted until April, long enough to give put himself in respectable second place. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\"><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/interactive/2016/politics/election-candidate-matchmaker/\">Related: 2016 Candidate Matchmaker</a></p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Santorum had thought his runner-up status would have earned him respect with voters and with the party in 2016, but the country had changed. He would be like Ronald Reagan, a man who also won 11 states and returned the next election cycle in victory and transformed the conservative movement, he suggested to audiences across the country.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">But Santorum again struggled. This cycle was even more difficult for him, as he had to share attention with Donald Trump and was always relegated to the media ghetto of humiliating \"undercard debates,\" which were never held in prime time. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">But he slogged on, hoping that lightning would strike twice.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">On Sunday, while much of the evening was focused on the positive, Santorum used the opportunity to vent his frustration with a process that he contends kept him down. For months he, and other candidates, have complained about the debate process, and the media's relentless wall-to-wall Trump coverage.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"It's very frustrating for a lot of us. But I can't really blame a lot of the media for focusing attention on somebody who's going to make them money,\" he said.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Santorum, however, didn't train his anger on the media, as other candidates so often do. For him, the real responsibility for the state of the race lay at the feet of the Republican National Committee. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"It's one thing if you're a profit-making company...it's another thing to be sanctioned by the Republican National Committee,\" Santorum said, his voice suddenly sounding louder and angrier. \"And because of that sanction, you have a responsibility beyond just making money. The RNC did not hold these new channels to the standard that should be required, which is that everybody one of our presidential candidates will be treated with dignity and respect. Period. Everyone. There is no under-card! There is no kids' table! Everybody is treated with respect. Why? Because they are running for the nomination of our party, and we demand it. But they never did.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">In the corner of the room stood Foster Friess, Santorum's billionaire super PAC financier from Wyoming, wearing a beige wide brim hat and cowboy jacket that looks more Sundance than Sioux City. Over the past few years, Friess has funded Santorum's efforts by writing multi-million dollar checks to his super PAC, the Red, White and Blue Fund. He has remained fiercely loyal to the Pennsylvania senator the entire time in both good times and bad. And on this final night, he was here to see it through the end. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"Think of the witness that he gives,\" Friess told CNN. \"I don't care if he doesn't make it to dog catcher. I'm willing to pay for this guy's example of being a bridge builder, of being civil, of having politics work like it should.

Mike Huckabee and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, the last two winners of the Iowa GOP caucuses, can't escape the low single digits, they could conclude they have no path to the nomination and drop out -- a move that would likely help Cruz, who appeals to a similar set of voters. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The three governors looking to win the \"establishment lane,\" meanwhile -- Jeb Bush, Chris Christie and John Kasich -- are all looking ahead to New Hampshire. While a stronger-than-expected result in Iowa could help, a poor showing is unlikely to hurt enough for any to drop out. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">On the Democratic side, Sanders would likely benefit most if former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley drops out. But he'd have preferred that it happen before Iowa, the state where O'Malley's support might matter most. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The final days in Iowa have been packed with surprises -- starting with Trump's decision to skip the final debate on Fox News. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Clinton was the subject of tough headlines headed into the weekend as the State Department refused to release 22 of her emails, retroactively classifying them -- and raising the specter, once again, of a lengthy, damaging federal investigation into her private email use during her tenure as secretary of state. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">O'Malley's backers also <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/31/politics/martin-omalley-important-iowa/\">have a choice to make</a>. Democratic Iowa caucus rules say that to reach \"viability,\" a candidate must have support of 15% of the caucus-goers in that precinct. If too few voters support a candidate, those individuals are freed to support another candidate of their choosing.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The former Maryland governor, however, isn't close to 15%. He's <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/31/politics/martin-omalley-important-iowa/\">sitting at 3%</a> in Saturday's Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics poll. His supporters could make the difference for Clinton or Sanders.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">There's also the great unknown that Nature can deliver: A snowstorm is due in Iowa, and while it appears it will hold off until Tuesday, bad weather on caucus night would likely mean more people stay home. </p>"], "article_highlights": [], "article_author": ["Eric Bradner"]}

And that is something that I see in him, he might have the ability to just -- 'Boom' -- take care of things very quickly.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Retired schoolteacher Paul Thompson, 75, ranks Cruz at the top of his list because \"he is an evangelical Christian, as I am,\" he said. But he too is feeling the gravitational pull to Trump's candidacy. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Thompson had a simple answer when asked to explain why Trump, a Presbyterian, is leading among evangelicals in some polls given his personal history and changing stances over the years. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"We want to see a winner, and I think we perceive him as a winner,\" he said.  </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Cruz has worked diligently for months to court evangelical voters, who often show up in droves every four years to caucus for Republicans. That decision for many evangelicals between head and heart could very well decide who wins Iowa on Monday night after a tight race between the Texas senator and the real estate magnate. <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/30/politics/des-moines-register-poll-donald-trump-ted-cruz-hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders/index.html\">The Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics Iowa Poll </a>released Saturday evening found Trump leading Cruz 28% to 23%.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\"><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/28/politics/donald-trump-ted-cruz-anti-establishment/\">How Trump and Cruz went from Ivy League to anti-establishment</a></p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">While many had assumed that Cruz would have a lock on white evangelical voters, particularly as support for retired pediatric neurosurgeon Ben Carson has waned, Trump has shown surprising strength within that voter group. In a Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist poll released Thursday, Trump notched the support of 31% of evangelical Christians to Cruz's 28%. But in a poll of likely Iowa caucus participants released earlier by Quinnipiac University, Cruz led Trump among white born-again evangelicals 34% to 27%.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Nationally, Trump was leading Cruz among GOP evangelicals 39% to 25%, according to a CNN/ORC poll released Tuesday. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Florida Sen. Marco Rubio's efforts to reach evangelicals also appear to be paying dividends after a month in which he has emphasized his faith. Though Rubio is far behind Trump and Cruz in Iowa polls, a number of evangelicals mentioned him as their third choice in interviews over the past week and he is rising in the polls. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Evangelical voters are the most reliable bloc of caucus-goers on the Republican side and they have had outsized influence in past election cycles. In 2012, some 57% of voters entering the Iowa caucuses in 2012 described themselves as evangelical Christians, according to polling by the Pew Research Center\u2014and they helped Rick Santorum narrowly edge out Mitt Romney in Iowa, just as they helped former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee four years earlier.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\"><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/31/politics/ted-cruz-marco-rubio-immigration/index.html\">READ: Cruz targets Rubio ahead of Iowa caucuses</a></p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">With that history in mind, Cruz allies have pummeled Trump over the past week as a political opportunist who cannot be trusted, given his past positions on issues like partial birth abortion.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">One blistering ad from a super PAC supporting Cruz described Trump as \"extreme\" on abortion and used a video clip from a 1999 interview where \"Meet the Press\" host Tim Russert asked whether a \"President Trump\" would ban \"partial birth abortion.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The ad shows part of Trump's answer -- \"I am pro-choice in every respect.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">It is not just Trump's past statements that are at issue. When asked about his faith, voters here sometimes bring up Trump's embarrassing gaffe at Liberty University where he quoted from \"Two Corinthians\" instead of \"Second Corinthians,\" or the event in Ames last year where he said he didn't think he'd ever sought forgiveness from God.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Trump went a long way to buttressing his credibility by winning an endorsement from evangelical leader Jerry Falwell Jr. of Liberty University, though Falwell's decision caused an uproar within the Liberty University alumni community.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Falwell <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/30/politics/donald-trump-jerry-falwell-iowa-2016/index.html\">doubled down on his endorsement Saturday </a>night as he appeared with Trump on the campaign trail. His praise was effusive -- at times almost fawning -- as he essentially told the Davenport crowd that he was willing to take the heat over his decision. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Trump, he said at least twice, reminded him of his father, the famed televangelist and Southern Baptist pastor Jerry Falwell Sr. He cited private acts of generosity that he said Trump does not typically boast about -- from financial assistance that he said the mogul offered to a couple who helped him with his broken-down limousine to his aid for an inner city basketball team. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">By way of explaining his endorsement of Trump, Falwell noted that any parent who had a sick child would seek the best doctor they could find.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"It may not be a doctor who goes to your church, but it's the one who has the most experience with that particular illness,\" he said.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">His father, he added, \"was criticized in the late 1970s, early '80s, because he supported Ronald Reagan, a Hollywood actor who had been divorced and remarried, over Jimmy Carter, who was a Sunday school teacher -- a southern Baptist Sunday school teacher,\" Falwell said.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"You know, I think he made the right decision. He explained that when he went into the voting booth, he wasn't trying to elect a Sunday school teacher, or pastor, or even somebody who shared his theological beliefs,\" Falwell said. \"He was trying to elect the most qualified person to be the president of the United States. We know Jimmy Carter was a great Sunday school teacher; but look how he did as President.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\"><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/29/politics/iowa-caucuses-donald-trump-ted-cruz-marco-rubio-jeb-bush/index.html\">READ: Campaigns lower expectations in Iowa, brace for Trump win</a></p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Trump went a step further on Saturday by releasing a closing message to evangelicals on Facebook, showing the Bible that his mother had given him and thanking conservative Christians for supporting him.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"My mother gave me this Bible, this very Bible, many years ago. In fact it's her writing right here. She wrote the name and my address, and it's just very special to me,\" Trump said in the Facebook video. \"And again, I want to thank the evangelicals. I will never let you down.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">But that's still an open question for some evangelicals here. Seventeen-year-old David Blom said he went to a Trump event last week, in part, to try to get a better sense of the authenticity of his faith. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"Just listening to the language from Trump tonight, he said 'terminated' instead of 'killed' when he was talking about life,\" said Blom, who has trained other students at his school to caucus (many, he said, are leaning toward Trump or Cruz). \"He makes fun of the media, but then he uses the pro-choice, and pro-abortion term instead of what an Iowa evangelical would see as being a person of life and value.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"Life is super important and we can't have a new convert leading the pro-life movement as the Republican nominee,\" the high school senior said.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Surrogates for Cruz have traveled the state emphasizing Cruz's consistency on social issues like marriage, abortion and religious liberty.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\"><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/30/politics/ted-cruz-keep-the-promise-super-pac/index.html\">READ: Main Cruz super PACs struggled to raise money in fall and winter</a></p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"Ted Cruz is going to be the same today as he was yesterday, as he will be tomorrow,\" former Texas Gov. Rick Perry told voters at a Cruz event in Albia.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">On Saturday, the head of the Cruz campaign's \"99 Pastors\" group, Pastor Joseph Brown, penned an email to more than 150 pastors across Iowa encouraging them to \"prepare to challenge and equip your people for the Iowa Caucus taking place on Monday.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The message was heeded at Lutheran Church of Hope in West Des Moines Sunday morning, where Cruz attended services with his family. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Iowa congressman Steve King, who traveled the state on Cruz's behalf last week, predicted that some evangelical voters enamored by Trump will ultimately flip back to Cruz.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"Two thirds of the people who will come to caucus are full spectrum constitutional Christian conservatives. They are pro-life, they are pro-marriage, they are pro-religious liberty, they're pro-Second Amendment, they are pro-free enterprise and for a strong national defense,\" King said. \"They know what they believe in and they've been for three generations bringing their children up to caucus because it's part of their tradition.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Those voters, he argued, \"are very uneasy about Trump.... They don't know what he's going to do next.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">That is one reason that VanWeelden, a 73-year-old pastor from rural Albia, decided on Cruz. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"He speaks from his heart. He is not an act,\" he said.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">While Trump's taunting jabs at other candidates have amused some GOP voters, they are not in keeping with the language of a man who lives by his Christian faith.\" </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"I like Donald Trump in the way that he's not a politician,\" VanWeelden went on. \"We need somebody that's strong and stands by what he says, but I do believe you don't need to slander people to get there.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Christians, he noted, are \"taught to love our fellow man, not to run him into the ground or condemn him....

If turnout looks like 2004's 124,000, Hillary Clinton almost certainly wins. If it's closer to 2008's 239,000, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is the likely victor. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\"><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/29/politics/iowa-caucuses-explainer/index.html\">The Iowa caucuses, explained</a></p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Clinton's Iowa operation has long focused on committed Democrats -- those who reliably caucus, many of whom supported her 2008 campaign. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Sanders, meanwhile, has focused his energy on college towns and has pushed hard to bring new participants into the caucus process. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Two counties where Sanders must run up a huge delegate advantage are Johnson, where the University of Iowa is located, and Story, the home of Iowa State University. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">If he loses either -- or Clinton even comes particularly close -- Sanders won't win Iowa. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Polk County, the home of Des Moines and the state's most delegate-rich area, looks more like Clinton's territory: It's the state's largest urban area, and she has campaigned heavily both in its downtown and suburban regions. African-Americans and Latinos, small in number as they are in Iowa, could be the key to a Clinton victory.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">There's another candidate hoping for an expanded electorate: Donald Trump. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The Republican front-runner's appeal to disaffected conservatives -- and some independents and \"Reagan Democrats,\" too -- will be tested immediately. If he succeeds in drawing a huge turnout, it's a positive sign for Trump long past Iowa.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\"><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/29/politics/new-hampshire-primary-voters-republicans-2016/index.html\">Pulse of New Hampshire Republican voters: We are tired of losing</a></p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Texas Sen. Ted Cruz needs to win -- and win with a sizeable margin -- in the 44 counties west of Des Moines, which are more rural and more socially conservative than much of the state. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The establishment-leaning portion of the state could be Polk County and its more heavily-populated neighbors like Story and Dallas. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Northeastern and Southeastern Iowa were Ron Paul territory in 2012. Those areas are more libertarian than conservative, and could be the difference between Trump and Cruz. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Cruz turned Iowa into a boom-or-bust state when he predicted that Trump might run the table if he wins the Hawkeye State and told voters that caucusing for anyone else amounts to supporting Trump. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">That strategy might push him over the top and into first place. But it also means anything else is a bust -- and could leave him limping out of the Hawkeye State into New Hampshire, where Trump is also in the lead.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Monday is also Trump's first time on the ballot. He has consistently boasted about his poll numbers while on the stump. How will he react should he lose, even if only by a couple of points?</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Then there's what Twitter users are calling #Marcomentum: The sense that Florida Sen. Marco Rubio is surging late. Polls show him consistently running third behind Trump and Cruz, and if he manages to come close to those two, it would be a boon among establishment Republicans who are still searching for a candidate with a real path to the nomination. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Early-state results won't just identify front-runners -- they'll winnow what's an especially packed field of contenders on the Republican side. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">If former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, the last two winners of the Iowa GOP caucuses, can't escape the low single digits, they could conclude they have no path to the nomination and drop out -- a move that would likely help Cruz, who appeals to a similar set of voters. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The three governors looking to win the \"establishment lane,\" meanwhile -- Jeb Bush, Chris Christie and John Kasich -- are all looking ahead to New Hampshire. While a stronger-than-expected result in Iowa could help, a poor showing is unlikely to hurt enough for any to drop out. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">On the Democratic side, Sanders would likely benefit most if former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley drops out. But he'd have preferred that it happen before Iowa, the state where O'Malley's support might matter most. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The final days in Iowa have been packed with surprises -- starting with Trump's decision to skip the final debate on Fox News. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Clinton was the subject of tough headlines headed into the weekend as the State Department refused to release 22 of her emails, retroactively classifying them -- and raising the specter, once again, of a lengthy, damaging federal investigation into her private email use during her tenure as secretary of state. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">O'Malley's backers also <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/31/politics/martin-omalley-important-iowa/\">have a choice to make</a>. Democratic Iowa caucus rules say that to reach \"viability,\" a candidate must have support of 15% of the caucus-goers in that precinct. If too few voters support a candidate, those individuals are freed to support another candidate of their choosing.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The former Maryland governor, however, isn't close to 15%. He's <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/31/politics/martin-omalley-important-iowa/\">sitting at 3%</a> in Saturday's Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics poll. His supporters could make the difference for Clinton or Sanders.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">There's also the great unknown that Nature can deliver: A snowstorm is due in Iowa, and while it appears it will hold off until Tuesday, bad weather on caucus night would likely mean more people stay home. </p>"], "article_highlights": [], "article_author": ["Eric Bradner"]}

They've harnessed despair at the failure of establishment GOP leaders to subvert what they see as Obama-era power grabs, condescension from the \"liberal media\" and loathing for political correctness on race, gender and sexuality.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">This success poses a question that gets to the heart of the 2016 race as Trump and Cruz, one and two in national polls, seem poised to share the spoils in early voting states: Just how did two men so familiar with the inside become avatars for the outside?</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\"><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/27/politics/donald-trump-leads-ted-cruz-iowa-poll/index.html\">Iowa poll: Donald Trump builds on lead over Ted Cruz</a></p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Their methods differ, and perhaps to some degree they are simply benefiting from being in the right place at the right time. But it's indisputable that both Trump and Cruz spotted and then exploited an opportunity thrown up by a singular moment in U.S. political history that in retrospect both seem to have been working toward for years.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"The establishment believes the goal of politics is simply to control the levers of power,\" said Michael Needham, CEO of the conservative advocacy group Heritage Action for America. \"Right now, there are two candidates in the GOP race vying to be the most anti-establishment: Donald Trump based on personality and words, and Ted Cruz based on conservative principles and an unwillingness to be co-opted in Washington.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\"><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/26/politics/donald-trump-ted-cruz-lie/\">Trump rips Cruz: 'Lie after lie'</a></p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The concept of the establishment -- the idea of a group of influential power brokers running government and politics, the media and the law, big business and finance -- has become a dominant theme in the 2016 White House race so far.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Trump and Cruz have used it to devalue the resumes of traditional \"governing\" candidates like former Florida Gov. <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/interactive/2015/05/politics/2016-election-candidates/#Bush\">Jeb Bush</a> and current Ohio Gov. <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/interactive/2015/05/politics/2016-election-candidates/#Kasich\">John Kasich</a>, who were once the conservative radicals of their day. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Candidates with a foot in the insider and outsider camp have meanwhile struggled.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Florida Sen.<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/interactive/2015/05/politics/2016-election-candidates/#Rubio\"> Marco Rubio</a>, for example, was a rabble-rouser himself just six years ago when he rode the tea party wave to usurp establishment favorite Charlie Crist in the GOP primary for their state's open Senate seat. Yet now, after dabbling in immigration reform, Rubio has been branded by his foes as just another turncoat Washington politician.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Trump has effectively leveraged a persona refined on reality television; a mastery of direct, simple language; and an uncanny ear for the economic and philosophical grievances of Americans a million metaphorical miles removed from his Manhattan penthouse.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">He might have made his billions in the boardroom, but there has been no more forceful spokesman for many Americans disaffected with the political system, and who, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/27/politics/donald-trump-voters-2016-election/index.html\">a major new CNN investigation shows,</a> feel he speaks for them in a way no seasoned politician can.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">His scrappy, bullying, back-alley schtick is the antidote to the political correctness that people in his base so disdain. He might be loaded and rarely seen in business hours without a suit and tie, but he doesn't hang with the CEO crowd that flocked to Davos for the World Economic Forum last week.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">From the gold-plated seat belts in his personal airliner to his helicopters to his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach to his beautiful wives, Trump is hardly old money and revels in his wealth and fine things like someone who has won the lottery. It's an image that can resonate more with Main Street than the studied indifference of a Wall Street tycoon who hobnobs comfortably with other members of the 1%.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">And by being so direct about his riches, Trump has taken the issue of wealth off the table as a political weapon. He's avoided the fate of 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney, a former private equity executive who was vilified by the Obama campaign as apathetic about the sufferings of everyday Americans while he installed car elevators in his house.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">And in a neat trick, Trump has actually made the case that his wealth solidifies his outsider appeal by giving him immunity to pressure from establishment donors.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">In retrospect, Trump's long<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/20/politics/donald-trump-ben-carson-obama-muslim/\"> \"birther\" </a>crusade, seeking to prove that <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/12/26/us/barack-obama---fast-facts/\">Barack Obama</a> was born abroad and therefore constitutionally disqualified from being president, was more than the \"carnival barker\" distraction of the lunatic political fringe that the Hawaii-born President dismissed it as.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">It was a shrewd political base-building strategy that connected Trump with a seething community of Americans susceptible to a populist, even demagogic, message based on race and class that he would later mobilize for his presidential campaign.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">To connect with his \"silent majority,\" Trump avoids the soaring campaign poetry of Obama, the eye-glazing wonkery of a Jeb Bush or Democratic national front-runner Hillary Clinton, or the gassy lingo of a candidate baked in the conventions of Capitol Hill.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Instead, he holds forth spontaneously, unfurling outrage-laden streams of consciousness from his podium. He seems to have no filter between his brain and his mouth.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">It's an intimate and effective form of communication, even when delivered in a stadium, and has much in common with the confiding monologue of another wealthy spokesman for the common man, conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh. This blunt, outspoken style also happens to be tailor-made for Twitter, Trump's conduit direct to his faithful flock.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">While GOP elites cringe at Trump's rants against <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/24/politics/donald-trump-birthright-citizenship-undocumented-immigrants/\">Mexicans</a>, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/07/politics/donald-trump-muslim-ban-immigration/\">Muslims</a>, women and others, his supporters simply see further affirmation that he's just like them.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\"><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/23/opinions/brazile-trump-women-voters/\">Opinion: Time to call Trump out on degrading views</a></p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"He speaks like a guy down at the loading dock,\" said Dave Shiflett, who ghost wrote one of the billionaire's first political manifestos, \"Trump: The America We Deserve,\" published in 2000.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"He comes across as a man of the people because he is voicing their anger with the political class and all of the elites,\" he continued. \"He is always a hydrogen bomb going off and there is no subtlety to what he says.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Trump hinted at his magic political formula in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on January 20, in a speech torching Republican aristocrats. He said George Will, a veteran conservative Washington Post columnist, looked \"stupid\" without his glasses and mocked Karl Rove, a former George W. Bush White House political director, as a \"boiler waiting to explode.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">But he also indulged in a rare moment of self-reflection, explaining how, despite coming from a different universe than audience members, he had become their champion.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"They always say, 'He is so plain spoken,'\" Trump said of the political commentariat. \"Plain spoken? I know more than any of these guys. Plain spoken? I went to (an) Ivy League school, the whole thing,\" Trump said.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"I can come up with extremely nice words, except there is no better word to describe our leader and our administration than the word ... what? ... stupid. Stupid.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">He went on to use the word several times: \"These are stupid people. These are stupid people. What is going on in Washington is purely stupid. Give me a better word than that and I will use it.\" </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">He concluded, \"All the Ivy League I have, the Wharton School of Finance, somehow they have never come up with a better word to describe what we are going through.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">For Shiflett, such language is the root of Trump's appeal.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"All these politicians are people who everybody thinks are just double-talk and they won't say what they mean,\" he said. \"Trump says, 'To hell with that. I am a regular guy.'\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Few people would refer to Rafael Edward \"Ted\" Cruz as a regular guy.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">But it's his good fortune, or perhaps a sign of how he's molded his political persona to his times, that he finds himself on the rise in a turbulent political season.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Whereas Trump's anti-elite persona is based on performance art, Cruz relies mainly on ideological positioning.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Superficially, Cruz's life seems one long parable about the value of insider connections.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">His intellect and ambition greased his path from Princeton to Harvard Law and to a clerkship in Chief Justice William Rehnquist's chambers. He worked on the Florida recount operation for GOP candidate George W. Bush in 2000, which the Bush dynasty packed with establishment titans like James Baker III.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">As solicitor general of Texas, Cruz became a star advocate at the bar of the Supreme Court, then made his way to the U.S. Senate.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">But a closer look at his past reveals a man who always gravitated to the outside and offers clues to the bond he has established with voters over suspicion of elites.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">He was a constitutional conservative even when surrounded by liberal academia.

The establishment has now picked Donald Trump,\" Cruz spokesman Rick Tyler told CNN last week, after former Republican presidential nominee and Senate leader Bob Dole said Cruz would be worse for the GOP than Trump.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"Why? Because the establishment in Washington, the dealmakers, they know that Donald Trump will make a deal. He will play ball with them. He will keep them all in power.

The hope is that by running up the score in Davenport, Cedar Rapids and Des Moines -- more urban areas in a primarily rural state -- Clinton will be able to pad her delegate total. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">By Monday, Clinton will have held 40 open press events in Iowa in 2016. The counties she will have visited have an average of 68 delegates up for grabs. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"As we come in to the final days, we are focused on turning our people out ... focused on increasing and maximizing support and ... making sure we are in the right places,\" said Matt Paul, Clinton's Iowa campaign manager.  </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Sanders, on the other hand, has spent much of January focused on smaller counties with fewer delegates. He has visited Jackson County (9 delegates), Hardin County (7 delegates) and Buchanan County (10 delegates) and has spent considerable time turning out big crowds of supporters at colleges in these small delegate counties. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\"><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/28/politics/obama-phony-tough-talk-gop/index.html\">Barack Obama calls out GOP's 'phony tough talk and bluster'</a></p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Sanders will have held 44 Iowa events in 2016 by Monday. But his average delegate total -- at 58 -- is 10 less than Clinton. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">This is by design, says Pete D'Alessandro, the head of Sanders' Iowa campaign. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"This is different than an election. This isn't one person, one vote,\" D'Alessandro said. \"The difference in a caucus situation is you can actually saturate to the point, even if you have a huge lead or you are very popular, in one area.\" </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Sanders' Iowa campaign is well aware of this. Earlier this week, the Vermont senator held a rally with over 2,000 people at Luther College in Decorah. The size of the crowd was impressive to Sanders' aides. But those watching knew that Winneshiek County, where the event was held, has only 11 delegates up for grabs.  </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"It is the same number of delegates going to the state convention if you got 200 or 2,000 people,\" said Rep. Dave Loebsack, a Clinton supporter, about Sanders' event at Luther College. \"I think it's good for Hillary because I think her support is clearly spread out throughout the state and they have been working on it for a longer amount of time.\" </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">So why would Sanders go to Luther? His approach is \"surgical,\" said D'Alessandro. \"Even though it is smaller, hey, if we can get 14 more people to that caucus, we actually win another delegate.\" </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">But there is a problem with this plan. There is a ceiling on how many delegates Sanders can win in these small counties, even if his campaign turns out thousands of people. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">To counteract that problem, Sanders' campaign is urging college students - who are able to caucus in their hometowns or where their college is located - to go home to caucus. This will spread out the Sanders support, his aides hope, and allow him to use his support among young people to help him in more urban counties. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\"><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/28/politics/bernie-sanders-medical-records/index.html\">Sanders releases doctor's note</a></p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">D'Alessandro said the campaign has also had to deal with the fact that Clinton has run in Iowa before, even if she lost badly in 2008. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"One of the myths of the Iowa caucuses is that Hillary Clinton didn't run a good campaign in 2008,\" he said, noting she still started the 2016 race with a list of hundreds of people who backed her previously able to step in this time around. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Sanders' strategy reflects these comments. In the last month, Sanders is only making four stops in counties Clinton won in 2008, including none in the final weekend before the caucuses. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">On the other hand, Clinton has focused most of her time in counties she lost in 2008. From January 1 to February 1, Clinton will have made only six stops in counties she won eight years ago. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The strategy positions Clinton to over-perform in areas that Barack Obama and John Edwards won in 2008, her aides hope, leading to decisive wins in Iowa's handful of cities. Clinton's campaign has also deployed a fleet of surrogates to rally supporters in areas she will not visit. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"It is critically important in the caucuses that you respect that these caucuses are about relationships and you build those relationships with your organizers and your volunteers overtime,\" Paul said. \"We have built, since April, (an operation) to do this on a statewide level so that we are engaged with, talking to and listening to Iowans no matter where they are in a number of different ways.\" </p>"], "article_highlights": ["Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are going into into caucus night with different delegate-winning strategies", "The secret to the Iowa caucuses is this: Not all caucus sites are created equal"], "article_author": ["Dan Merica"]}

Where this hatred comes from and why we will have to determine,\" Trump said in a statement. \"Until we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses, our country cannot be the victims of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in Jihad, and have no sense of reason or respect for human life.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Trump's campaign added in the release that such a ban should remain in effect \"until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The release pointed to an online poll from the controversial Center for Security Policy, which claimed that a quarter of Muslims living in the U.S. believe violence against Americans  is justified as part of a global jihadist campaign. Critics have questioned the reliability of the organization's information.<strong> </strong>It also pointed to a Pew Research poll, which the campaign declined to identify, which the campaign claimed points to \"great hatred towards Americans by large segments of the Muslim population.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski told CNN on Monday that the ban would apply not just to Muslim foreigners looking to immigrate to the U.S., but also to Muslims looking to visit the U.S. as tourists.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"Everyone,\" Lewandowski said when asked if the ban would also apply to Muslim tourists.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"Great surveillance and vigilance must be adhered to,\" said Trump in an additional statement Lewandowski provided to CNN. \"We want to be very fair but too many bad things are happening and the percentage of true hatred is too great.

I think they're great people,\" Trump told CNN in September.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">And when he became tied to the idea of creating a database of all Muslims living in the U.S., Trump sought to distance himself from that proposal -- insisting that the idea was a reporter's and he was not committed to it.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, speaking to members of the Muslim community earlier in the afternoon, echoed the President's sentiment on Sunday warning against divisiveness.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"Bitterness grows out of hopelessness, and there is no hopelessness in this situation, however uncomfortable and menacing it may be at times,\" he said. \"Faith in the ultimate strength of the democratic philosophy and code of the Nation as a whole has always been stronger than the impulse to despair\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">It didn't take long for the rest of the Republican presidential primary field to repudiate Trump's call.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">New Jersey Gov.

We have to start a process where we take back our country. Our country is going to hell,\" the Republican presidential front-runner told Fox News on Tuesday night. Trump said he would \"test it out\" in the courts.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Trump has called for the deportation of all undocumented immigrants living in the United States, about 11 million people, and then allowing the \"good ones\" to return through an expedited legal process.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">On Wednesday morning, he was questioned by CNN's \"New Day\" co-host Chris Cuomo about his call to end birthright citizenship as granted under the 14th Amendment, which states that \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and the state wherein they reside.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"The 14th Amendment is very questionable as to whether or not somebody can come over, have a baby and immediately that baby is a citizen,\" Trump told Cuomo.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Trump didn't answer Cuomo's question about the retroactive application of his proposed policy, which if carried out, would mean Judith's two brothers, who were born to undocumented parents, could be stripped of their citizenship.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Judith said she doesn't feel safe, either, even though by the time she was born, her parents had obtained legal residency through a granting of amnesty in the 1980s.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Eladio and his family obtained legal residency in the 1980s through the amnesty, too, but he also thinks he could be affected if Trump's policy was imposed retroactively.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Eladio said he was 6 years old when his mother crossed him and three of his siblings illegally from Mexico's northern state of Sonora into Arizona. He was the youngest of the group, but remembers the details of the voyage very well.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"We crossed a fence that was broken. The person who was taking us, he guided us to the entrance and we just crossed,\" said Eladio, who remembers his mom maintaining a tight grip on his hand, because \"she was scared.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"We had nothing in Mexico,\" recalled Eladio, explaining that they had left for better opportunity. \"We lived on a small ranch. There were 11 houses in that ranch.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">He said he and his family boarded a plane to Chicago shortly after crossing the broken fence and arrived in the city's Little Village, a neighborhood that today is predominantly Latino.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Eladio wondered how Trump's suggestion of allowing the \"good ones\" back after deportation would work.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"I consider myself good,\" said Eladio, but he pointed out that no one really knows what constitutes a \"good\" immigrant.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"Where does it stop?\" Judith asked. \"He said he's not going to separate families, that he's just going to send them back together, but where does it stop?\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Trump's focus on immigration is forcing his Republican competitors to take a stand.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker have sided with Trump on the issue of birthright citizenship, though they acknowledge that changing it would be difficult.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Still, they and other detractors argue that the country must enforce immigration laws and not unfairly reward those who break them by granting citizenship to their children -- and then potentially to the undocumented immigrants themselves who can then claim status through their children.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">In addition, they contend that the birthright citizenship clause, an outlier in the developed world, encourages more people to take the risk of entering the United States without permission in order to secure citizenship for their children.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Not all Republicans want to rescind the practice. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush oppose the repeal of the 14th Amendment.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">But for the present time, Trump is gaining momentum and continues to lead the Republican race. Should his immigration policy come to pass, it could be life-changing for the Montoyas and their extended family.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"Our life is here. Our homes are here,\" Judith said.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"What is going to happen to our business? What's going to happen with our kids? What's going to happen to our employees?\" Eladio asked, contemplating the prospect of losing his citizenship. \"I would be forced to shut down our business that's creating jobs and feeding families.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">But the Montoyas say they are willing to put Trump's comments about Mexicans being \"rapists\" and \"killers\" aside and invite the real estate mogul to any one of their Los Mangos locations, where everyone, they say, is welcomed with a smile.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"I want him to come here to my business and see that we are not criminals. We didn't come here to rob anybody,\" Eladio said. \"We are not taking anybody's job.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">If Trump were to come, Eladio has a message for him: \"We are making America great.\"</p>"], "article_highlights": ["Donald Trump said he doesn't think people born in the U.S. to undocumented immigrants are citizens", "Trump's focus on immigration is forcing his Republican competitors to take a stand."], "article_author": ["Rosa Flores"]}

Wong Kim Ark.</em> In that case, a man born to two Chinese parents who were living in the U.S. traveled to China for a brief visit before returning to the States, where he had spent his entire childhood, but he was denied entry. The high court held that he was a U.S. citizen, as were all children born to immigrants living in the U.S. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">According to <a href=\"http://cis.org/birthright-citizenship\" target=\"_blank\">an analysis</a> by the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for reducing immigration, 30 countries of the world's 194 have a policy of birthright citizenship, with the U.S. and Canada the only advanced economies to do so.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Republicans say that birthright citizenship needs to be changed to stem illegal immigration. They argue that having children become U.S. citizens is a motivating factor for immigrants to come into the country illegally, and that when the child reaches adulthood he or she can try to sponsor their parents for citizenship. The U.S. also rarely moves to deport parents of U.S. citizens, they say.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Critics of birthright citizenship also claim \"birth tourism\" is a troubling and growing concern. The Center for Immigration Studies this spring compared CDC data on children born to foreign mothers with Census data on foreign-born women reporting having a child, and <a href=\"http://www.cis.org/camarota/there-are-possibly-36000-birth-tourists-annually\" target=\"_blank\">concluded</a> there are about 36,000 birth tourists having children in the U.S. a year. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">In 2010, the <a href=\"http://www.pewhispanic.org/2010/08/11/unauthorized-immigrants-and-their-us-born-children/\" target=\"_blank\">Pew Hispanic Center</a> estimated that 340,000 out of 4.3 million babies born in the U.S. in 2008 were the children of unauthorized immigrants, about 8 percent.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"There's no doubt that it's a growing phenomenon,\" CIS legal policy analyst Jon Feere said. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">In 2010, though, PolitiFact found there <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/aug/06/lindsey-graham/illegal-immigrants-anchor-babies-birthright/\" target=\"_blank\">wasn't much credence</a> to claims that there is a rampant \"drop and leave\" phenomenon of mothers having their child in the U.S. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">There is a dispute over whether ending birthright citizenship is possible without a constitutional amendment. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Some critics of birthright citizenship say it could be changed by law, by defining what \"subject to the jurisdiction thereof\" means in the 14th Amendment. The provision thus far has only been interpreted to rule out children of diplomats, invading armies and, when the amendment was enacted, Native Americans, who would have had to give up their place on a reservation if they were automatically conferred U.S. citizenship.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">One of the biggest political proponents of this position is Iowa Rep. Steve King, a Republican who has introduced legislation to restrict birthright citizenship to legal residents. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"If the Constitution required them to be citizens, anyone born on the United States, it would just say all persons born in the United States are American citizens,\" King told CNN in Iowa on Monday. \"But the clause, 'and subject to the jurisdiction thereof', is the subject of a significant amount of legal scholarship ... Someone who comes in here illegally are not fully subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, they're not subject to being drafted, for example, so you can change it statutorily.\" </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Immigration supporters say there's a reason the issue hasn't come up before the Supreme Court since 1898 -- and it's because it's settled. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"I feel like this is some kind of bad legal Groundhog's Day,\" said Karen Tumlin, managing attorney at the National Immigration Law Center. \"These proposals come up perennially, but there is no gray area here: This is very clear language in a constitutional amendment...We don't alter the constitution lightly in this country.\" </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Which side is right, ultimately would have to be determined by the Supreme Court, Feere said. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Lawmakers have been introducing constitutional amendments and legal clarifications like King's for decades. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">In 1993, Nevada Sen. Harry Reid -- now the Senate Minority Leader -- espoused ending birthright citizenship, introducing <a href=\"http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-103s1351is/pdf/BILLS-103s1351is.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">legislation</a> to do so. Though his past position is often cited by Republicans supporting the move, including by Trump in his policy paper, Reid later disavowed his actions. In a 2006 speech, he <a href=\"http://lasvegassun.com/news/2010/jul/21/immigration-push-reid-regrets/\" target=\"_blank\">called</a> it \"the biggest mistake I ever made.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">In the current Congress, King has introduced his legislation in the House, and Louisiana Republican Sen. David Vitter has done the same in the Senate. Neither bill has gone anywhere beyond introduction, as is true of virtually all past legislative attempts to end birthright citizenship.</p>"], "article_highlights": ["Birthright has come up in the nation's highest court -- but the biggest cases were decided in the 19th century.

You know, compared to that, repealing Obamacare and abolishing the IRS ain't all that tough.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Liberty offered Cruz a ready-made crowd: young evangelicals in a vast auditorium who had little choice but to pack the stands, because the announcement came during their compulsory weekly convocation. This is exactly the kind of coalition of youthful Christian idealists Cruz must win over and get to work in early voting states if his presidential hopes are to catch fire.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">But Cruz won't have this political territory all to himself. Several students sat in the audience within view of the cameras wearing red T-shirts emblazoned with \"Rand,\" referring to Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who is also likely to make a play for young conservatives.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Meanwhile, Walker, with his governing record and history of facing down a recall and trade unions, seems to have eclipsed Cruz in the minds of many conservatives who are desperate to take back the White House.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"When the grass roots look at a guy like Scott Walker -- he can not only bridge the divide, we believe, in the Republican Party, but he might be the one who can bridge the divide like he did in Wisconsin,\" said Jennifer Stefano, a Pennsylvania tea party activist. \"That's what I think is dominating Ted Cruz -- he has not made as many headlines as in 2013, as when he tried to stop and defund Obamacare.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Cruz must also face off against Paul, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum and Dr. Ben Carson to win evangelicals -- a tough task. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"It's a crowded field to begin with and it's almost as if, within the Republican contest, there are some early sub-primaries: Who is going to be the establishment candidate? Who is going to be the social conservative candidate?\" said David Yepsen, who was for years the dean of Iowa caucus reporters from his perch at the Des Moines Register.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\"><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/03/23/politics/ted-cruz-goldman-sachs-health-care/index.html\">READ: Cruz to lose Goldman Sachs health benefits</a></p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Meanwhile, a CNN/ORC International Poll last week put Cruz as the choice of 4% of likely Republican voters.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">So if he seems unlikely to win, why would Cruz get in -- and so early?</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Paradoxically, the size of the task facing Cruz and the tempered expectations for his bid may also mean that the risks that often weigh against a presidential candidacy -- the potential damage to a political career that can be caused by a poorly run campaign --  may not apply.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Perkins said he had been assured by Cruz personally that he believes he can create a path to the nomination -- and ultimately the presidency -- despite the fact that he would be taking aim at the White House with the almost unanimous disapproval of the Republican establishment.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Announcing now could give Cruz more time to test messages beyond those tailored for evangelicals. He used his speech Monday to also slam Common Core education standards and immigration reform, areas where establishment GOP favorite Jeb Bush is perceived to be vulnerable. He also joined the hawkish Republican barrage on foreign policy, slamming President Barack Obama over his row with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his record on Iran and combating \"radical Islamic terrorism.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">But should he fall short in his 2016 bid, a successful campaign that positions Cruz as the leader of the evangelical right would certainly boost his political brand and position him for a future presidential run. And at only age 44, there's plenty of time for that. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">His Texas Senate seat, meanwhile, seems to be his as long as he wants it. He doesn't have to run for re-election until 2018, so a presidential bid wouldn't get in the way of the day job.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">So in a sense, Cruz may not have that much to lose. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Another reason to get in early is Iowa. The state is going to be crucial for Cruz's hopes because it is the most fertile early voting territory for his chosen campaign path. A win in the first-in-the-nation caucus could crown Cruz as the undisputed champion of the social and evangelical conservative wing of the party.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">But he is going to be facing proven Iowa campaigners. Huckabee won the state in 2008 and Santorum won a recount over the eventual GOP nominee, Mitt Romney, in 2012. Both have substantial networks of support and, crucially, know many caucus voters personally in a state where the personal touch counts for everything. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"I think Cruz has generated some excitement in Iowa, and he is a new face,\" said Yepsen. \"But it is going to be a while before he closes the sale with a lot of activists.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">An added bonus for Cruz getting in now: The early bird gets the best coverage.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">In a matter of weeks, Republican presidential announcements from the massive GOP field will draw little more than a shrug, so getting out ahead of expected announcements from Paul and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio could be a good idea. When Democrat Hillary Clinton makes her official plunge into the 2016 race, any Republican candidate may struggle to dominate media coverage for several weeks.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Monday also happened to be the fifth anniversary of the day Obamacare was signed into law. Because Cruz has spent endless hours trying to overturn it -- winning the appreciation of conservative activists in the process -- Monday was a good moment to highlight the point.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Then there is money. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Cruz, unlike some other potential Republican candidates, may have to work extra hard to raise the campaign funds he needs to mount a viable campaign. His early announcement gives him time for a post-announcement spurt before the next quarterly fundraising figures close at the end of the month, and a full three months to put up an impressive number in the next quarter.</p>"], "article_highlights": ["Ted Cruz's decision to jump-start the 2016 election season is an implicit admission of the challenges he faces", "Cruz will fight a bevy of other candidates for the votes of the Christian right"], "article_author": ["Stephen Collinson"]}

Instead, it calls for deporting all \"criminal aliens.\" It does not address the deportation of otherwise law-abiding undocumented immigrants.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Trump also explained how he would force the Mexican government to bankroll a wall along the southern border.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">If Mexico refuses to pay for the wall, a Trump administration would begin charging additional fees to Mexicans who come into the U.S. on visas or with border crossing cars -- particularly for visas to \"Mexican CEOs and diplomats,\" which Trump would cancel \"if necessary.\" Trump's plan also calls for possible tariffs and foreign aid cuts and would seize \"all remittance payments derived from illegal wages.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"The Mexican government has taken the United States to the cleaners. They are responsible for this problem, and they must help pay to clean it up,\" Trump wrote. \"We will not be taken advantage of anymore.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Immigration advocates quickly slammed Trump's proposal Sunday.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"The extremism is stunning, and the direction is dangerous,\" said Frank Sharry, the executive director of pro-immigration group America's Voice. \"Trump's 'plan' would create a police state capable of rounding up and deporting all 11 million hardworking immigrant families settled in America.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Sharry also criticized Trump's move to change the birthright citizenship rules and put further limits on legal immigration.  </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"Fortunately, these marginalized ideas are as unpopular as they are unworkable, and thus will never happen,\" he said.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Trump's policy plan drew praise, though, from the<a href=\"http://www.fairus.org/\" target=\"_blank\"> Federation for American Immigration Reform</a>, a group that supports reducing the number of both legal and undocumented immigrants in the U.S. and has been <a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2007/12/11/fair-crossing-rubicon-hate\" target=\"_blank\">labeled a hate group in 2007</a> by the Southern Poverty Law Center.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"In much the same way that we enforce most civil laws in this country, the plan aims at deterring most violations of the law, and provides meaningful penalties for those who are not deterred,\" spokesman Ira Mehlman said in an email.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">But Trump's immigration plan would surely draw stiff opposition from Democrats in Congress, but it's also likely to raise alarm with the big business, a major proponent of high-skilled visas.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The price tag for his plan could draw the ire of Republicans, too.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">A 2013 bipartisan immigration bill that cleared the Senate called for doubling the number of border patrol agents and completing some 700 miles of fence along the border. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office pegged the cost of the bill around $23 billion, mainly because of the security measures included.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Ultimately, the CBO said the Senate bill would have reduced the federal deficit by legalizing millions of immigrants living in the country illegally and, in turn, boosting tax revenues. The CBO also said that legislation would spur economic growth.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Trump's plan, however, does not include those revenue-generating provisions.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">To prevent additional undocumented immigrants for entering and staying in the United States, Trump pledged to \"defund sanctuary cities\" -- stripping cities of federal dollars if they do not fully cooperate with federal immigration officials -- establish a nationwide employment \"e-verify\" system, and end the \"catch-and-release\" policy of detaining illegal immigrants without deporting them.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">While most of Trump's brash rhetoric has focused on ending illegal immigration peppered with charges that immigrants coming from Mexico are \"killers\" and \"rapists,\" Trump has also advocated for streamlining the legal U.S. immigration system.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">There was little mention of that in his latest policy proposal. Instead, it relied heavily on plans designed to protect American jobs from foreign workers and called for tighter rules on visas for high-skilled workers. In crafting his plan, Trump sought advice from Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, a longtime supporter of curbing both legal and illegal immigration.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"The influx of foreign workers holds down salaries, keeps unemployment high, and makes it difficult for poor and working class Americans -- including immigrants themselves and their children -- to earn a middle class wage,\" Trump wrote in his proposal.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Trump's first policy paper comes somewhat begrudgingly. In a press conference Saturday, he downplayed voters' interest in such policy specifics, calling them a preoccupation of the press. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"I think the press is more eager to see it than the voters, to be honest,\" Trump told reporters in Iowa Sunday. \"I don't think the people care.

He argued that both parties are to blame for the rising debt, saying it doubled under a Republican administration and tripled under Obama. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"Government should be restrained and freedom should be maximized,\" he said. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The line-up of speakers who introduced Paul sought to paint the senator as a nontraditional candidate with diverse appeal, and by the time he got on stage, he was the first white man to address the crowd.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The speakers included J.C. Watts, a former congressman who's African-American; state Sen. Ralph Alvarado, who's Hispanic; local pastor Jerry Stephenson, who's African American and a former Democrat; and University of Kentucky student Lauren Bosler. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"He goes everywhere. It doesn't matter what color you are. Rand Paul will be there,\" Stephenson said, firing up the crowd. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">So far, Paul joins only Texas Sen. Ted Cruz as a declared candidate for the GOP presidential nomination. \"His entry into the race will no doubt raise the bar of competition,\" Cruz said in a statement welcoming Paul into the race. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">But the field is certain to grow in the months ahead with Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, Scott Walker, Lindsey Graham and others eyeing a campaign. Marco Rubio, a Florida GOP senator, is expected to launch his campaign next week.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Bush, who said his 2016 decision is a \"while off,\" told reporters in Colorado Springs on Tuesday that \"libertarianism definitely has a place in the GOP\" but stressed that he differs with Paul on foreign policy.  </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">For now, the nomination is up for grabs with no clear front-runner. Paul came in third place at 12% in a CNN/ORC International Poll of Republicans. Bush led the pack at 16% while Walker came in second at 13%. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Paul, the son of former Texas congressman and three-time presidential hopeful Ron Paul, will build on his father's legacy as a candidate eager to bring civil liberties to the forefront of the national dialogue. He's already used his perch on Capitol Hill to draw attention to those issues, including a 13-hour<a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2013/03/06/rand-pauls-filiblizzard-filibuster/\"> filibuster</a> two years ago blasting the Obama administration's drone policies and a <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2014/02/12/rand-paul-announces-suit-against-obama-administration-over-nsa/\">lawsuit </a>against the National Security Agency's phone metadata collection effort. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">But Paul, 52, will split from his father in one important way: his approach to the campaign. Where Ron Paul often focused on creating a libertarian movement, Rand Paul is planning a more strategic, less purist operation that could have a hope of competing in a general election. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The elder Paul sat on stage at the rally on Tuesday with his wife, though he's not expected to be a public face for his son's campaign. He merely attended the event as a \"proud papa,\" a source close to the senator said. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Elected in 2010 with strong tea-party support, Rand Paul quickly rose to national fame in part due to his father's back-to-back White House runs in 2008 and 2012, but also because of Rand Paul's willingness to fight fellow Republicans. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">He engaged in a war of words with Chris Christie two years ago over national security and federal spending and, more recently, he's taken swipes at Bush over issues like Common Core and medical marijuana.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Still, Paul has carefully worked to form inroads with establishment Republicans and other factions of the party's base. He's done so by becoming close political allies with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/02/politics/rand-paul-chamber-ad/\">backing mainstream candidates</a> who competed against libertarian opponents during last year's midterms.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">He's also tried to make peace with national security Republicans, taking nuanced positions that try to shed an isolationist label while still showing his apprehension toward foreign intervention. Last year, for example, he supported limited airstrikes against ISIS but vigorously <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/videos/bestoftv/2014/10/10/tsr-sot-rand-paul-wolf-blitzer-isis-weapons.cnn\">fought against arming Syrian rebels</a>.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">While he bills himself as a conservative realist, Paul still tries to wear the mantle as the Republican most reluctant to take the country into war.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"I can tell you there will be one loud voice in our party saying, think of the unintended consequence,\" <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/02/07/politics/rand-paul-iowa-wrap/\">Paul said in Iowa two months ago</a>. \"Think about what we're going to accomplish and whether it will work before we go to war.' I promise you that will always be something I take very, very seriously.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The cautious foreign policy dance has drawn criticism from his father's supporters, who say Paul has become too moderate, and from hawkish Republicans who fear he wouldn't go far enough as commander in chief to tackle problems overseas. Democrats and some Republicans, meanwhile, have accused him of flip-flopping and pandering to donors.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\"><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/18/politics/rand-paul-mccain-senate-isis/\">READ: Rand Paul: Washington's 'barnacled enablers' push for constant war</a></p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">On Tuesday,  the Foundation for a Secure &amp; Prosperous America -- a hawkish group from the right -- released a $1 million television ad buy against Paul's foreign policy, which hits the airwaves nationally on cable, as well as in the key early states that Paul will visit this week. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"Rand Paul is wrong and dangerous,\" says the narrator in the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYSMN9X_5pY&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=sp&amp;utm_campaign=20150406_22429675_&amp;utm_content=www_youtube_com_watch_v_sYSMN9&amp;action=email_click&amp;ha1=\" target=\"_blank\">30-second spot</a>, arguing that Paul doesn't understand the threat of Iran's nuclear program. The ad ends with an image of a nuclear bomb detonating. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Paul had been silent on the Iran deal until his speech on Tuesday, when he vowed to oppose any deal that doesn't guarantee Iran gives up its nuclear ambition.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">He also sought to sound aggressive on terrorism. \"The enemy is radical Islam and not only will I name the enemy, I will do what ever it takes to defend America from these haters of mankind,\" he said. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">In an interview later Tuesday, Paul argued that the ad was \"crazy\" and represented what he called the \"the naivety of the neocons.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"These loud, sort of juvenile voices putting pictures of bombs on ads, these are the people who are so reckless that it would be a grave danger to our country to ever have these people in charge of our country,\" he said in an interview with Sean Hannity on Fox News. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">In the same interview, Paul also weighed in for the first time on the religious freedom debate that took center stage last week after an Indiana law -- which has since been changed-- came under fire for what critics said was discrimination against gay and lesbian couples getting married. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The 2016 Republican field largely came out in defense of the law, standing by the rights of small business owners such as florists and bakers to decline participating in same-sex weddings. Paul said he felt the law was \"unnecessary\" and that the country's founding fathers would be \"aghast\" that laws needed to be in place to protect religious rights. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"That being said,\" he added. \"I think the law ought to be neutral and we shouldn't treat people unfairly.\"  </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Asked which takes precedence, religious liberty or same-sex marriage rights, Paul said, \"freedom.\" </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"I don't think you can have coercion in a free society very well,\" he said. \"So I would think we ought to try freedom in most of these things.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Paul is actually running for two offices at the same time, trying to hold onto his Senate seat while also running for president. Kentucky's election laws say candidates can't appear on a ballot twice, but with reluctant support from McConnell, a Kentucky powerhouse, the state's GOP will likely change its presidential preference vote from a primary to a caucus. That would allow Paul to get around the rule.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">His interest in the Oval Office has never really been a secret. Shortly after the 2012 presidential election, he started crisscrossing the country to paint himself as a nontraditional Republican eager to court voters who don't typically live and vote in red areas.  </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">He spoke at historically black colleges and universities, as well as Democratic strongholds like inner city Detroit and the University of California, Berkeley, focusing on criminal justice reform and civil liberties, two issues he believes can bring more people into the Republican Party.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"Liberal policies have failed our inner cities,\" he said Tuesday. \"Our schools are not equal and the poverty gap continues to widen.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">But Democrats are eager to paint Paul as another member of the \"same old Republican Party.\" </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"On issue after issue his policies are the same as the rest of the GOP, but even more extreme, and will turn back the clock on the progress we have made,\" said Democratic National Committee chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz in a statement. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">As one of the few national politicians who went to Ferguson, Missouri, Paul frequently boasts that there is no \"bigger defender of minority rights in the Congress\" than himself.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\"><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2014/11/25/politics/paul-minority-outreach/\">READ: Rand Paul dives back into Ferguson debate</a></p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">But those efforts <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2014/07/02/politics/rand-paul-civil-rights-act/\">could prove futile</a> if he can't get beyond controversial comments he made in 2010, when he questioned parts of the Civil Rights Act, especially provisions that place restrictions on private property.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">He's steered clear of such hot-button issues more recently. Last week, for example, he was one of the few Republicans who didn't weigh in on religious freedom laws in Indiana and Arkansas that critics argued would allow businesses to discriminate against gays and lesbians. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Paul has also worked to maintain a following that includes a large swath of young voters who he partly inherited from his father. Heavy on tech and social media, his political team has opened an office in Austin, Texas, and will soon establish one in the heart of Silicon Valley. Like clockwork, Paul frequently holds up his phone during his stump speech and declares that what people do on their smartphones is \"none of the government's damn business.\" </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">His nontraditional style is complemented by Paul's wardrobe. The senator is known for wearing blue jeans with boots and a blazer when he's on the trail, and during the winter, he opts for a turtleneck and sport coat rather than a tie. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">But in his quest to become a national figure, Paul's comments have come under scrutiny and some of his statements have led critics to question whether he's ready for prime time. Earlier this year, Paul, an ophthalmologist, lent credibility to theories that <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/02/02/politics/rand-paul-vaccine-effects/\">vaccinations cause mental disorders</a>, and last fall he caused a stir when suggesting that people could catch Ebola at cocktail parties.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">And while he's not media shy\u2014he's given hundreds of interviews in the past year alone\u2014Paul can get short-tempered with reporters. He shushed a female interviewer in February, and last fall he blew up at a reporter who asked a question about foreign aid to Israel.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\"> </p>"], "article_highlights": [], "article_author": ["Ashley Killough"]}

The venue choice at this socially conservative campus aims to give Cruz an early boost among evangelical voters, who will be key to boosting presidential hopefuls in states like Iowa and South Carolina that have early nominating contests. It was a youthful crowd, as students are required to attend the University's tri-weekly convocation address.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Not all in the audience were guaranteed Cruz supporters: Several attendees sported red \"Stand with Rand\" shirts, repping Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul, who is slated to announce his candidacy early next month.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Jerry Falwell Jr., the university's president and son of its founder and evangelical icon, introduced Cruz as a senator who \"has gone against the tide\" and a \"man of great character,\" all while stressing that the university does not endorse candidates for office.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Falwell picked up on Cruz's assertion that millions of evangelical Christians did not vote in 2012, pointing out that \"if any candidate can energize that group, it will make a huge difference in any national race.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Asked after the speech how he prepared for the event, Cruz said he \"spent some time in prayer\" thinking about the message he wants to convey.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"At the end of the day it's listening to the people about the vision for turning the country around,\" Cruz told CNN, adding that he was \"incredibly\" encouraged and inspired by the support.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Cruz's announcement came on the five-year anniversary of the passage of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, which Cruz has fought in the Senate to repeal. Cruz marked the anniversary by pledging to repeal \"every word\" of the healthcare law as president.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Cruz also jabbed at Common Core education standards -- which Bush supports -- and repeated his pledge to abolish the IRS, instead suggesting Americans could file their taxes on a postcard.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">And Cruz drew the longest and loudest applause from the audience when he prompted the audience to \"imagine a President who stands unapologetically with the nation of Israel.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Cruz's advisers envision a three-pronged strategy that focuses on dominating the tea party faction and competing in the libertarian and Christian conservative circles. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">A constant and vocal critic of the Obama administration, Cruz is perhaps best known for his stalwart fight against Obamacare in 2013, which led to a tense standoff between Democrats and Republicans and ultimately resulted in a 17-day government shutdown. The showdown was punctuated by <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2013/09/25/politics/cruz-how-he-did-it/\" target=\"_blank\">Cruz's 21-hour speech on the Senate floor</a>. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">While popular in conservative and tea party circles, Cruz has a long way to go in terms of broader support in the GOP base, according to public opinion polls. <a href=\"http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2015/images/03/17/poll.2016.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">A CNN/ORC International survey conducted this month</a> on the hypothetical Republican primary showed Cruz came in with 4% support among Republicans and independents who lean Republican.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">But the field is still relatively open, with the top contender -- Bush -- coming in at 16% support, followed by Scott Walker at 13%.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">But Cruz has relatively strong favorability numbers.

Depending on the Senate schedule this week, he could possibly make more early-state trips, according to advisers. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">After his speech Monday, he'll head up to New York for media appearances and a fund-raiser.   </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Cruz developed a loyal following when he won his 2012 primary battle in Texas as a little-known candidate, forcing then-Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst into a surprise runoff and ultimately defeating the establishment Republican.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Along with two other first-term senators who are expected to run for president (Rand Paul and Marco Rubio), Cruz will likely face questions over experience, an issue that Republicans brought up in 2008 against Barack Obama, who was also a first-term senator at the time.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Before running for the Senate in 2012 -- his first campaign for public office -- Cruz was solicitor general of Texas and argued before the Supreme Court. He graduated from Princeton University and Harvard Law School. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Born in Canada to a Cuban father and American mother, Cruz was a dual citizen <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2014/06/11/politics/ted-cruz-canada-citizenship/\" target=\"_blank\">until he renounced Canadian citizenship in 2014</a>.

As O'Malley discussed the problem of income inequality and concentration of wealth, one protester angrily yelled out: \"You did that!

It is a sacred trust to be earned from the people of the United States, and exercised on behalf of the people of the United States.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Perhaps O'Malley's biggest challenge is finding a way to dent the Clinton political machine while also proving that he's a competitive candidate in his own right -- not just a backup for progressives who would rather see Sen.

Under his leadership, the state tightened gun laws, implemented a progressive tax code and legalized same-sex marriage. He also expanded the state's health care rolls, championed Obamacare and signed a bill raising the state's minimum wage to $10.10 an hour.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Yet O'Malley found himself defending that Maryland record recently when riots broke out in Baltimore over the death of a 25-year-old African-American man under police custody.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The treatment of Freddie Gray, which sparked a national dialogue about police conduct toward racial minorities, drew renewed scrutiny to the controversial zero-tolerance policing strategy that O'Malley advocated for as mayor -- part of an aggressive strategy to crack down on crime.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">In an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper last month, O'Malley declared that Baltimore saw a \"record reduction in violent crime\" under his watch.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">There are \"probably now 1,000 mostly young, poor African-American men who did not die violent deaths in our city\" because of these policies, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/30/politics/martin-omalley-baltimore-freddie-gray-responsibility/\">O'Malley said</a>. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">O'Malley may also face questions about his popularity in his home state. His standing took a hit last year when Maryland voters rejected his handpicked successor in the governor's race, Democrat Anthony Brown. Brown lost the statehouse to Republican Larry Hogan.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"I can tell you my feelings were hurt,\" O'Malley said about the loss. \"We had done a lot of really good things in Maryland, and in the end you did not hear much about it during the campaign.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">But he added, \"I was not on the ballot.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">O'Malley is aiming to present himself as a fresh voice for the party -- one who speaks for a different generation than Washington heavy hitters such as the 67-year-old Clinton.

Prior to that, he'll stop in New York City for fundraisers on Thursday, and will spent Tuesday and Wednesday back in Washington focused on Senate business.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Rubio now faces the challenge of maintaining establishment interest while growing his appeal among conservatives. The right remains wary of Rubio for partnering with Democrats on an ultimately failed immigration reform bill after riding into office on the 2010 tea party wave.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">But in the middle is just where Rubio wants to be.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">He's hoping to carve out a path in the crowded GOP field as the candidate who's not too far right to lack credibility nationally, and yet not too squishy on conservative priorities like guns and same-sex marriage to lose the GOP base.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Rubio has eschewed the bomb-throwing of conservatives like Cruz and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, and the head-spinning vacillations of some of the party's more establishment-minded candidates in favor of what supporters see as a candid pragmatism. His career in politics \u2014 which began with a stint as West Miami city commissioner and found him ascending to House speaker before his surprise U.S. Senate win in 2010 \u2014 has been centered on that pragmatism, supporters say.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">He was the first in the 2016 field to declare, without reservations, that parents \"absolutely\" should vaccinate their children. <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/01/07/politics/rubio-courts-overturn-gay-marriage-ban/\" target=\"_blank\">On same-sex marriage</a>, he said if the Supreme Court rules it's constitutionally protected, \"we have to abide\" by that ruling. He repeatedly asserted that it was impossible to defund President Obama's immigration executive order by shutting down the Department of Homeland Security.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">That strategy means he may not win any of the early nominating states that typically winnow down the field, but the senator and his advisers are banking on top-three finishes that keep him in the game until the flaws in the rest of the field are apparent and voters are looking for another option.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">But it doesn't come without risks. One of Rubio's biggest obstacles to the nomination remains a persistent skepticism among conservatives who believe he sold out by taking a lead role in negotiating the 2013 immigration reform bill, which died in the House after Rubio helped secure its passage in the Senate.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">In doing so, he plummeted from Tea Party darling and GOP rising star to freshman has-been in a matter of months, facing hecklers at town hall meetings and declining approval ratings in his home state.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Still, he's made light of the controversy, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/02/20/politics/rubio-heckled-by-immigration-protesters/\" target=\"_blank\">joking at a February event</a> that he's the rare elected official to be heckled \"by both sides of the immigration debate.\" And the gambit won him enduring respect among many establishment Republicans, who admire his willingness to compromise and cut deals.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Where Rubio has seized the spotlight, however, he's made it count.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Rubio <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/02/03/politics/rubio-cuba-hearing/\" target=\"_blank\">led the charge</a> earlier this year against the Obama administration's move to thaw relations with Cuba, appearing on nearly every major news network to slam the policy shift as shortsighted and scheduling hearings as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Western Hemisphere Subcommittee on the issue.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The potential advantages for Rubio in the Cuba issue were varied. It allowed Rubio to introduce himself to an entirely new audience of Americans, as the historic policy shift drew front-page headlines nationwide. It gave him an opportunity to emphasize his compelling personal narrative as the son of Cuban immigrants who left the country due to many of the same hardships imposed by the Castro regime that Cubans continue to experience today.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">And it was yet another chance for Rubio to stake a claim as the GOP's strongest candidate on foreign policy, which Republicans believe will become a defining issue in the primary and general elections.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">While Rubio hopes to wind his way down the middle of the GOP, he and his advisers believe foreign policy will be his calling card in the 2016 election: The issue that piques voters' interest keeps them coming back.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The freshman senator has been working since his early days in office to build the experience to make that case. He's taken 12 trips abroad since 2010 and co-sponsored more than a dozen bills on issues ranging from Russia's aggression against Ukraine to humanitarian crises in Haiti. He is a frequent and prominent critic of Obama's plan to tackle ISIS, and has slammed the Iran deal as insufficient to prevent the nation from gaining nuclear weapons.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Rubio has weekly briefings on foreign policy issues with leading advisers in the party, and aides say he's a voracious reader of policy papers and international news.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">But first, he'll have to maneuver his way through the rocky and complicated primary terrain, and his launch puts him on a certain collision course with another Florida politician: former Gov. Jeb Bush.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Bush holds a slight lead over the field in early polling and remains the preferred pick for most of the GOP's establishment wing, and has already locked up a sizable chunk of the party's big donors, despite being still weeks away from announcing.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">With Florida moving to a winner-take-all primary system, the Sunshine State showdown on March 15 could prove to be a pivotal contest for both candidates, and Bush's team <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/us/politics/jeb-bushs-team-plots-vast-effort-to-win-florida.html?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\">is reportedly already strategizing</a> to lock up the state's primary vote.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">But Rubio's already shown that Bush will be less of an obstacle than many initially expected, as he's managed to post strong fundraising totals despite competing with Bush for hometown dollars.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Before Rubio makes it to Florida, however, he'll have to stay in the game for the party's early nominating contests. Though he's not yet the clear pick for voters in Iowa, New Hampshire or South Carolina, he's hired a top-notch team of strategists to steer him through the primaries there.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Those include Todd Harris, a Rubio campaign strategist, who advised Jeb Bush in the early 2000s before helping drive Rubio to an upset Senate victory in 2010; Terry Sullivan, who's running Rubio's PAC and previously ran former South Carolina Sen. Jim DeMint's campaign; and Jim Merrill, Mitt Romney's New Hampshire guru, who's serving in the same role for Rubio.</p>"], "article_highlights": [], "article_author": ["Alexandra Jaffe"]}

Or does it let it continue unimpeded?</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">No and no. The truth lies somewhere in the middle.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, as this deal is being called, states point blank that \"Iran reaffirms that under no circumstances will (it) ever seek, develop or acquire nuclear weapons.\" The distinction is between nuclear weaponry and nuclear power.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Iran's state-run Islamic Republic News Agency stresses that, under the deal, \"world powers have recognized Iran's peaceful nuclear program and are to respect the nuclear rights of (Iran) within international conventions.\" By this, it means a country's right -- including Iran's, since it signed the <a href=\"http://www.un.org/disarmament/WMD/Nuclear/NPT.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons</a> -- to enrich nuclear fuel for civilian purposes.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The IRNA report stresses no Iranian nuclear facilities or centrifuges will be dismantled, including the Arak heavy water reactor. It also states \"the policy of preventing enrichment uranium is now failed and Iran will go ahead with its enrichment program.\" And Iranian students now can be allowed to study in nuclear fields.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">But none of this means Iran's nuclear program won't change significantly.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\"><a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2015/07/14/middleeast/iran-deal-social-reaction/index.html\">World reacts to landmark deal</a></p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Iran's government didn't focus on what its government must do to diminish its nuclear program, but the U.S. State Department did, in its synopsis of the agreement. It says that Iran will:</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\u2022 Keep its uranium enrichment levels at no more than 3.67%, down from near 20%.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\u2022 Maintain a uranium stockpile (at the above prescribed level) under 300 kilograms, well below its current 10,000-kilogram stockpile. President Barack Obama says this works out to Iran reducing its nuclear stockpile by 98%.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\u2022 Phase out its IR-1 centrifuges within 10 years, keeping over 5,000 centrifuges running during this stretch at its Natanz facility. \"Excess centrifuges and enrichment-related infrastructure at Natanz will be stored under IAEA continuous monitoring.\" (The IAEA is the International Atomic Energey Agency, the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog.) Nationwide, Obama said that Iran will put away about two-thirds of its roughly 19,000 current centrifuges. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\u2022 Not have any nuclear material at its Fordow facility for 15 years, converting that site \"into a nuclear, physics and technology center.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\u2022 Limit certain research and development activities for the next eight years. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\u2022 \"Design and rebuild a modernized heavy water research reactor in Arak ... using fuel enrichment up to 3.67%\" after getting international authorities' OK on the final design. \"The reactor will support peaceful nuclear research and radioisotope production for medical and instructional purposes.\" Iran will not add any other heavy water reactors for the next 15 years.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\u2022 Ship spent fuel outside its borders.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Of course, it's not as simple as Iran signing a piece of paper, agreeing to a bunch of things, and this yearslong impasse being over. For the United States, European Union and others to believe Iran is living up to the bargain, they have to see it -- through the eyes of inspectors.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"This deal is not built on trust; it is built on verification,\" Obama said. \"Inspectors will have 24/7 access to Iran's key nuclear facilities.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The IAEA will take the lead. That group and Iran have already signed a \"road map\" outlining a process that <a href=\"https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/pressreleases/iaea-director-generals-statement-and-road-map-clarification-past-present-outstanding-issues-regarding-irans-nuclear-program\" target=\"_blank\">IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano said</a> aims \"to make an assessment of issues relating to possible military dimensions to Iran's nuclear program by the end of 2015.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"It sets out a clear sequence of activities over the coming months, including the provision by Iran of explanations regarding outstanding issues,\" Amano added. \"It provides for technical expert meetings, technical measures and discussions.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Inspectors look likely to spend the bulk of their time at Iran's established nuclear facilities like Natanz, Fordow and Arak. They'll have a number of tasks: </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\u2022 Monitor uranium levels \"from all uranium ore concentration plants for 25 years,\" according to the State Department.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\u2022 Keep an eye on all centrifuges (including those Iran will store, per the agreement) for 20 years to ensure Tehran is abiding by the agreement.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\u2022 Communicate back and forth with Iranian officials over the next few months to get explanations on key points and address \"any possible ambiguities.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\u2022 Maintain a \"long-term presence in Iran,\" beyond its specific objectives.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Iran doesn't have to grant permission for inspectors to go somewhere, said White House deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes, because Washington and its European allies have enough votes to make it so.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"If they don't grant access,\" Rhodes said, \"they violate the deal.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The big worry of U.S. and allied leaders wasn't that Iran might have nuclear energy, but that it would have nuclear missiles and bombs.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Thus, Iran's military -- which would have a role in weaponizing such technology -- has to be part of the discussion.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The IAEA chief noted his agency and Iran have reached \"a separate agreement regarding the issue of Parchin,\" a military site. This suggests international inspectors will get some access at least to that base southeast of Tehran, though it's not clear how much or if they'll be able to check on other military sites.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Because of the deal, Iran said it soon will no longer face the restrictions that have long affected its military. There will still be limits on ballistic missiles, IRNA pointed out, but only on \"missiles designed for nuclear weapons.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The same state news report added that \"Iran's arms embargo (will) be lifted or be replaced with some restrictions,\" some of which might be addressed on a case-by-case basis. \"These restrictions will be completely removed after five years.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">It's not clear to what extent all parties to the Vienna agreement, though, will loosen up on military matters. The United States, for instance, insists that it will continue to enforce sanctions tied to \"Iran's support for terrorism, human rights abuses and missile activities.\" </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">To what extent, though, remains to be seen.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Why did Iran make this deal? Yes, leaders in Tehran have claimed they never wanted nuclear weapons in the first place. But their main reason to act now is to lift various international sanctions that have hurt Iran's economy for years.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">President Hassan Rouhani has stressed since his 2013 election campaign that one of his priorities is to help his country financially by making it less isolated and more a part of, rather than a target of, the international community. Having a nuclear deal is pivotal to that plan, with IRNA saying it paves the way for \"broadening ... cooperation with other countries.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">No surprise, then, that Iranian state news reported prominently that \"all unfair sanctions imposed by the U.N. Security Council ... are to be lifted\" and similar punishments levied by the European Union and U.S. governments should be phased out as well.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">These moves should include ending a ban on Iran's purchase of passenger airplanes, dropping sanctions on the country's central bank and oil company, and unfreezing \"tens of billions of dollars of Iran's revenues,\" according to the Iranian state news report.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The United Nations' moves should come once \"the IAEA-verified implementation of agreed nuclear-related matters by Iran\" is complete, the State Department said. While the U.S. government will keep other sanctions, it has agreed to drop those tied to Tehran's nuclear program.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">There's a catch, though. <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/14/politics/iran-nuclear-deal-congress-obama-block/index.html\">Obama will submit the deal to Congress to review</a> for 60 days, opening the door for legislators to nullify the pact. The President doesn't seem inclined to budge, however.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\"><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/14/politics/iran-nuclear-deal-congress-obama-block/index.html\">Obama faces hard sell to Congress</a></p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"I will veto any legislation that prevents the successful implementation of this deal,\" Obama said.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Yet the U.S. President also emphasized that he is ready to abandon the agreement if Iran doesn't abide by it.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"If Iran violates the deal, all of these sanctions will snap back into place,\" he said. \"So there is a very clear incentive for Iran to follow through and there are very real consequences for a violation.\"</p>"], "article_highlights": ["Iran, the U.S. and others agree on a historic nuclear deal in Vienna", "It sets the stage for lifting sanctions on Iran, comprehensive inspections", "Obama: \"If Iran violates the deal, all of these sanctions will snap back into place\""], "article_author": ["Greg Botelho"]}

But Rubio has been working to position himself as a pragmatic conservative alternative to others in the field, and taking a hardline stance on immigration reform could undo those efforts.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">If he decides instead to run for re-election to the Senate, he's a heavy favorite in the primary.

The U.S.-Cuba relations remain a less-than-glamorous storyline, and an initially packed hearing room cleared out midway through when most of the senators left to vote. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">And with the threat from ISIS taking center stage in the debate over U.S. foreign policy, and others with considerable foreign policy chops, like South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, contemplating a run, it remains to be seen whether the Cuba issue will be a sufficient launching pad to keep Rubio in the national spotlight.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Rubio opened the initially full hearing with a series of assertive and pointed questions for a State Department official, seeking to pin her down on whether the U.S. would agree to limit its meetings with democracy activists as a condition for the U.S. government opening an embassy in Havana.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"Can you categorically say we will never accept that condition?\" he ultimately asked.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"It's not a real condition,\" the official replied.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">While the questions were incisive, they came in stark contrast to Sen. Rand Paul's <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/02/02/politics/rand-paul-vaccine-effects/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">prickly interview</a> with a CNBC host on Monday, during which he shushed her and yawned while she asked questions. The interview quickly went viral and drew him negative press.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">And Rubio's appeal as the son of Cuban immigrants for a party seeking to make inroads with Latinos was on display during the second panel, which featured witnesses delivering testimony almost entirely in Spanish, with the help of a translator.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">At one point, Rubio moved to ask a question after a witness had given her answer in Spanish, interrupting the interpreter. He apologized, adding, \"I could understand.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"I told Sen. Flake...not to worry about the translation. I'll let you know what they said later\" he joked, drawing laughter from the audience.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The senator's backers believe his experience on national security issues, and particularly his leadership on Cuba, could give him a leg up on the competition in the primary.

{"article_title": ["Now that he has a deal with Iran, Obama must face Congress"], "article_timestamp": ["Updated 1:42 PM ET, Tue July 14, 2015 "], "article_edsource": ["Washington (CNN)"], "article_url": ["http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/14/politics/iran-nuclear-deal-congress-obama-block/index.html"], "article_content": ["<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Because President Obama has already pledged to veto any bill to block the deal GOP leaders would need to convince enough Democrats to join with them to override his veto -- a heavy lift.  How the public views the deal will be critical, as Members of Congress will be back home for several weeks this summer before any vote. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\"><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/14/politics/iran-nuclear-deal/index.html\">RELATED: Landmark deal reached on Iran nuclear program</a></p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">While Obama on Tuesday said he welcomed a \"robust\" debate over the deal's merits, he issued a warning to lawmakers considering blocking the agreement, bluntly threatening to veto any measure that would prevent the deal from going into effect.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"Precisely because the stakes are so high, this is not the time for politics,\" he said in an address from the White House. \"Tough talk from Washington does not solve problems. Hard nosed diplomacy, leadership that has united the world's major powers, offers a more effective way of verifying Iran is not pursuing a nuclear weapon.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Like the completion earlier this month of a diplomatic renewal with Cuba, the deal with Iran provides Obama a tentative foreign policy achievement in the final year-and-a-half of his presidency. Both are built on the premise of engaging traditional U.S. foes, a vow Obama made at the very beginning of his presidency when he declared to hostile nations the United States would \"extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The deal -- which was finalized after almost two years of talks -- provides vindication for an administration that's sought to emphasize diplomacy over military force. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"This deal demonstrates that American diplomacy can bring about real and meaningful change,\" Obama said Tuesday, adding later that the deal \"offers an opportunity to move in a new direction.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">But even Obama himself has admitted there are risks inherent in striking an accord with a sworn U.S. enemy. Lawmakers, many deeply wary of those risks, now have 60 days to digest the provisions included in the deal with Iran, a two-month review period Congress insisted upon as the negotiations unfolded.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Obama was initially resistant to any congressional review of the Iran pact. But faced with overwhelming support among lawmakers for some kind of evaluation period, the White House ultimately conceded that Congress could be able to review the final deal before it takes full effect.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">It won't be easy for Congress to inflict damage on the agreement. They must act quickly -- and the two-month period in which they can scuttle the plan includes a month-long August recess, and only a handful of working days.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker told reporters Monday he expects to start hearings sometime shortly after the 60-day clock begins -- which will come sometime in the next five days, after the Director of National Intelligence completes a number of certifications to Congress about the deal, including that it meets U.S. non-proliferation objectives and does not jeopardize U.S. national security.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Corker said he wants first to ensure senators have ample time to read the agreement and its classified annexes so they are \"well versed\" before hearing from the administration and any outside experts he plans to call to testify. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Corker said he would like to complete hearings before the August recess -- which begins Aug. 7 -- so lawmakers have the recess to consider their positions. Under this scenario, up or down votes on the deal itself would not happen until mid-September, he said. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">In the House, a similar process and timeframe is also expected.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Within the 60-day span, opponents of the measure must rally votes to either enact new sanctions against Iran, or to disallow Obama from easing sanctions as part of the deal, measures the President would veto.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Overriding the veto in Congress would require a two-thirds majority -- meaning in the Senate, Obama must only secure a minimum of 34 votes in order for his deal to take effect. Additional time beyond the 60-day review period is included for Obama to veto any legislation, and for Congress to muster support for an override. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">If lawmakers fail to pass any new restrictions during the review period -- which ends in mid-September -- the deal will go into place, and sanctions will be lifted in Iran.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">But among deeply skeptical senators, who worry about Iran's support for terror groups and incarceration of Americans, even 34 Democratic votes in support of Obama aren't necessarily assured. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"Over this August recess there's going to be fast-and-furious lobbying, and we don't know whether there will be 34 votes,\" said former Democratic Rep. Jane Harman, who now heads the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">In the hours and days before the deal was announced, Republicans and Democrats alike expressed doubt the plan would be received warmly on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers have been voicing concern about Obama's desire to lift sanctions on Iran for the entirety of the nearly two-year negotiations. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">On Monday, the Obama administration claimed it was Republicans who would find themselves at a political disadvantage if they attempt a takedown of a deal that could end Iran's nuclear program.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"When it comes to a tough sell, I think the tough sell is going to be on the part of Republicans if they try to tank the deal,\" White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Monday.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">But in the aftermath of the deal's announcement, Republicans vowed a tough examination of the agreement.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"The comprehensive nuclear agreement announced today appears to further the flawed elements of April's interim agreement because the Obama administration approached these talks from a flawed perspective: reaching the best deal acceptable to Iran, rather than actually advancing our national goal of ending Iran's nuclear program,\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton, who, along with 46 Republican senators, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/03/16/politics/cotton-no-regrets-iran-letter/\">authored a controversial open letter</a> to Iranian leaders in March that warned them that a nuclear deal could be modified or abandoned by a future President, said the agreement was a \"grievous, dangerous mistake.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"It will give Iran tens of billions of dollars to finance (Iran's) sponsorship of terrorism against the United States and our allies,\" Cotton said in a statement. \"It will lift embargoes on conventional weapons and ballistic-missile sales to Iran. And, ultimately, it will pave the way for Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon. If this deal is approved, it will represent a historic defeat for the United States.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Corker, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman, said in a statement that he begins \"from a place of deep skepticism\" as he prepares to read the agreement, adding that his committee \"will conduct a rigorous review.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">New Jersey Sen. Robert Menendez, a senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has led Democratic opposition to the administration's Iran plans for months. On Tuesday, he told CNN's Joe Johns that he was disappointed in what he said was the deal's lack of \"anytime, anywhere inspections,\" which he \"thought was something that was one of our red lines.\" He added that the agreement still preserves Iran's nuclear infrastructure but held out hope that \"there can be an effort to get a better deal.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"The bottom line is: The deal doesn't end Iran's nuclear program -- it preserves it,\" he said later in a statement.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">But the potential for Iran to renege on its agreements isn't a concern only of the plan's opponents; Obama himself admitted there were risks to any deal in an interview earlier this year.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"Look, 20 years from now, I'm still going to be around, God willing. If Iran has a nuclear weapon, it's my name on this,\" he told The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg. \"I think it's fair to say that in addition to our profound national-security interests, I have a personal interest in locking this down.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Obama's stake in the Iran deal may only become more apparent after he leaves office; as in his diplomatic thaw with Cuba, the effects on ordinary citizens in those countries won't be seen for several years.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">He addressed the long-term prospects of success on Tuesday, saying the person who succeeds him in office -- and even the president after that -- will continue to enjoy the benefits of the deal.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"The same options available to me today will be available to any U.S. president in the future,\" Obama said. \"I have no doubt that 10 or 15 years from now, the person who holds this office will be in a far stronger position with Iran further away from a weapon.\"</p>"], "article_highlights": ["Republicans and Democrats alike have expressed doubt the plan would be received warmly on Capitol Hill", "The high bar for action on Capitol Hill will make it difficult for opponents to block the President"], "article_author": ["Kevin Liptak"]}

The senator is a longtime Bush protege and his bid is leaving activists and donors feeling divided over which camp to join. The looming push for the Latino vote could add another layer of complexity -- and personal animosity -- that might split allegiances of Republicans in this crucial swing state.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"Many of the older Cubans were with Jeb early on but for many of those exiles, Marco is the fulfillment of the American dream,\" said Nelson Diaz, the chairman of the Miami-Dade County Republican party. \"They will be torn between Jeb, who they adore, and Marco, who is almost like their grandchild.\"  </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The outcome of the Bush-Rubio tangle will be critical for Republicans as they look to reverse the party's declining fortunes among Latino voters, a growing demographic group that made up a record 10% of the electorate in 2012 and backed President Barack Obama over Mitt Romney 71% to 27%.  </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">A matchup of a Cuban senator against a white former governor from one of the nation's most prominent political families wouldn't normally be much of a contest.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">But the trappings of Rubio's speech suggest that the senator intends to compete aggressively for the Latino vote despite Bush's longstanding record of success with the Latino community.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">But Bush has some demographic advantages.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Less than 5% of Hispanics are Cuban, and Florida remains their epicenter. But outside of Florida, Mexicans dominate \u2014 roughly 75% of Latinos have roots in Mexico. Bush's wife, Columba, is among them.   </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"The difference with Bush is he has access to the Mexican American experience, which is really different than the Cuban experience,\" said Matt Barreto, who has extensively polled Latino voters and teaches at UCLA.  \"Rubio's biography is not unlike other immigrants, but Cubans had advantages that other immigrants don't. His experiences don't have the same resonance.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\"><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/13/politics/marco-rubio-2016-elections-polling/index.html\">READ: How does Marco Rubio stand in the polls?</a></p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">An October 2014 survey by Barreto's firm, Latino Decisions, found a national cross-section of Latinos splitting their support between Rubio, Bush and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. (Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who outpaced Obama among Latinos in 2008, was not included in the poll). </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The Bush family has successfully courted Latino voters in Florida and Texas, and in swing states across the country. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">George W. Bush grabbed over 40% of Latino votes in 2004. And in his 1998 race for Florida governor, Jeb Bush walloped his Democratic opponent, getting 61% of the Latino vote on the strength of Cubans. He approached that mark in 2002 when he won re-election.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Bush, who hasn't announced a run, is expected to make his appeal to Latino voters a central part of his electability argument. In speeches, he often lapses into Spanish. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"If Bill Clinton is the first black president, I'm definitely the first Cuban at least \u2014 or Latino \u2014 governor of the state Florida,\" he boasted at gathering of the Hispanic Leadership fund in 2012.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">(Florida's first Latino governor was Bob Martinez.)</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">And, at 62, Bush is almost two decades older than Rubio. That's a potential edge for Rubio since eligible Latino voters are younger than black and white eligible voters \u2014 nearly a third are between 18 and 29.  A candidate who can namedrop Jay-Z on the Senate floor like Rubio did during a drone filibuster, and is comfortable on social media and chatting it up on the Daily Show,  will likely resonate better with millennials than Bush, who can come across as a standard issue politician.  </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"Youth attracts youth,\" Diaz said.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Florida comes relatively late in the primary calendar, and before that, Rubio and Bush will compete in states with few Latino voters, where comprehensive reform is a nonstarter among conservatives.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">And even in early caucus states like Colorado and Nevada, Latino Republicans won't likely be decisive -- though laying a groundwork for the general election will be crucial for the GOP. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"About a quarter of Hispanics lean toward the Republican Party. Democrats have a large advantage and it's gotten bigger in the last years,\" said Mark Hugo Lopez, of the Pew Research Center. \"In Nevada, the population is largely Democratic-leaning and in Colorado, it's similar. In Florida, you can get biggest clustering (of Latinos) in a primary.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">In Florida, Bush and Rubio will battle over 471,000 Latinos who are registered Republicans. In the fall general election, the Republican and Democratic nominees will vie for 1.7 million Latino voters in Florida, and millions more in the heavily Latino swing states that will decide the election. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">With Bush, Rubio, and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who has been described as \"post-Hispanic,\" all in the race, Latino voters will see a level of visibility and outreach from Republicans not seen in previous primaries.  </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">But the trick will be navigating immigration reform, which is considered a gateway issue among many Latinos. Both Bush and Rubio have staked out moderate positions on immigration reform, with Cruz emerging as a hardliner.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Ultimately, for the GOP, having a presidential field that includes two Latinos and a \"Latino by association\" gives them a better chance at fixing their perception problems about Latino voters and closing the gap with Democrats that has cost them two national elections.  </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"Ted Cruz will do well among voters of Cuban background who are not supportive of immigration reform, which is a small group,\" said Bob Quasis, president of the national Latino group Caf\u00e9 Con Leche Republicans. \"I would slightly favor Jeb Bush, but Marco Rubio is a strong contender too. We have great prospects for winning the Latino vote.\"</p>"], "article_highlights": [], "article_author": ["Nia-Malika Henderson"]}

Among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, 74% called Clinton a candidate who represents the future, 61% said so of Warren and 51% of Biden.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Last month, Mitt Romney bowed out of the presidential race with a nod to his party's future, saying he hoped \"one of our next generation of Republican leaders, one who may not be as well-known as I am today\" would wind up better prepared to beat the eventual Democratic candidate.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">But Republicans don't see the field as particularly future-oriented. Of the four Republican candidates tested, a majority of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents rated two of them as more representative of the future than the past, Walker (55%) and Paul (53%). Fewer saw Christie (49%) or Bush (47%) that way.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Walker gained ground among Republicans in the race for the party's presidential nomination, the poll showed, while Christie and Bush both faltered. The shuffling field also saw a double-digit gain in support for former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, who now tops the field with 16%. The national survey found Huckabee closely followed by Bush at 14% (down 9 points), Walker at 11% (up 7 points) and Paul at 10%. Ben Carson lands in fifth with 8% and Chris Christie at sixth with 7% (down 6 points). No other candidate tops 5%.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Walker's gains are concentrated among older voters. He leads the field among those age 65 or up with 22%. Among Republicans under 50, Huckabee and Paul fare better than they do among their 65 and over counterparts.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Among conservative Republicans, it's a three-way tie: 15% each say they'd be most likely to support Bush, Huckabee and Walker, with 10% each behind Carson and Paul.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The poll finds less change on the Democratic side. Clinton still leads the field with 61%. Her next closest competitor, Biden, has gained six points since December and stands at 14%. Warren follows at 10%. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley all remain in the low single digits.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">As overseas turmoil riles President Barack Obama's approval ratings for handling foreign affairs, terrorism now joins the economy at the top of voters' priority lists as the 2016 contest kicks off. Forty-two percent called terrorism an extremely important issue in their presidential vote, on par with the 41% calling the economy that important. Education (40% extremely important) and health care (39% extremely important) also rank near the top.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Sharp partisan divides in priorities emerge outside the economy and health care. On terrorism, 87% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents say it's extremely or very important, compared with 78% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents. Republicans are more likely than Democrats to call illegal immigration an important issue (74% among Republicans vs. 55% among Democrats), while Democrats are more apt to prioritize the income gap (75% among Democrats vs. 45% among Republicans) and global warming (63% among Democrats vs. 23% of Republicans).</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The CNN/ORC International poll was conducted February 12-15, 2015, and interviewed 1,027 adult Americans, including 436 Republicans and independents who describe themselves as Republican, and 475 Democrats and independents who describe themselves as Democrats.

And where he could, he tied Hillary Clinton's name to Barack Obama's.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Walker also ventured into the world of foreign policy -- a place where he stumbled earlier this year -- with confidence.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">In one line, clearly made for campaign advertisements, Walker looked directly into the camera and said; \"Going forward the world must know, there is no greater friend and no greater enemy than the United States of America.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The line received huge cheers from the audience.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Walker laid in talk of his union battles and tax-cutting throughout the speech, but the lines which received the heartiest applause were about his support for Voter ID and </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Walker played up the hard-working fighter image Monday night, walking out on stage with no tie and his sleeves rolled up. Throughout the speech, the two-term governor sweated under the lights but delivered his key points smoothly.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Walker received general applause during his talk of taking on teacher's unions and making broad conservative education reforms similar to those former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush made about a decade ago. But he got his loudest applause  when he knocked the Common Core national education standards -- which he and other Republican governors largely supported before it became politically toxic for its association with Obama.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">In his first foray into a presidential campaign, Walker -- one of the most recognizable and polarizing governors in the country -- has emerged as a potentially formidable opponent to former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. Polling has consistently shown Walker leading the pack in Iowa, which borders southern Iowa, but he has fallen off in other national polling following a series of gaffes.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The biggest question for him now, as he becomes the 15th major-name Republican candidate, will be whether he can break out of the pack in other key states like New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Walker has been a torchbearer for top conservative priorities, showing again this that he had a few more presents for the party's rightwing base. Just a day before he was set to kick off his campaign, Walker was signing a $73 billion budget that only narrowly made it to his desk.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Included in there was the elimination of the \"prevailing wage\" -- a minimum wage for construction projects -- and a sizable cut to the state's university system. Walker was forced to backtrack, however, on an unannounced plan to curb government transparency by limiting access to public records.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Indeed, Walker has been a polarizing figure -- infuriating and mobilizing the left, in particular organized labor. By Monday afternoon, nearly 100 protesters had gathered outside his rally at the Waukesha Expo Center, though no protestors appeared to get into the rally itself. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Although Walker waited to launch his White House bid, he has been laying down the groundwork for a national campaign for months. The union-busting governor has been courting donors, traveling overseas and boosting his national profile by publicly tussling with President Barack Obama on issues like the nuclear deal with Iran.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The next several months will be a critical test for Walker. After his campaign announcement, the governor will crisscross the country, including a three-day RV tour through Iowa this coming weekend.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">A few months after taking office in 2011, Walker signed a measure to curb collective bargaining rights for most public employees in the state, framing it as an effort to take on the \"big government special interests\" and give power back to Wisconsin taxpayers.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The move triggered fierce backlash from labor unions and their progressive allies, sparking massive protests at the state capitol in Madison.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Conservatives in Wisconsin and around the country came to Walker's defense, helping the governor withstand a recall effort in 2012. Walker went on to win re-election by six points in 2014, his third statewide victory in four years.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">It is that recall experience, more than any other, that has helped lay the groundwork for Walker's presidential bid. At the time, Walker said his recall victory proved that \"voters really do want leaders who stand up and make the tough decisions.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">That is a message that Walker has promoted in recent months while exploring a presidential campaign, calling on the Republican Party to look for \"fresh leadership\" and someone with \"big, bold ideas and the courage to act on it.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Veteran GOP strategist Kevin Madden, who served as a senior adviser to Mitt Romney's presidential campaign in 2012, says Walker's union-busting efforts helped him to burnish his conservative credentials by demonstrating his ability to taken on \"the national [Democratic]establishment\" and beat them on three consecutive occasions.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Beyond his record as governor, Walker's Midwestern roots will be an invaluable asset in the GOP nominating fight -- Wisconsin voters haven't picked a Republican for president since 1984.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Walker is poised to make the case that his candidacy could put other Great Lakes states on the electoral map that have been out of reach for Republicans in recent cycles, including Michigan and Pennsylvania, which haven't voted for the GOP nominee since 1988.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"The path for a Republican to win the presidency comes through the Midwest,\" Walker told a crowd in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, in April. \"It comes from Iowa and Wisconsin and Michigan and Ohio and we're even going to include Pennsylvania because they're part of the Big Ten,\" he added.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Walker also has a personal narrative that could enable him to appeal to low-income voters, a group Republicans lost overwhelmingly in 2008 and 2012, with the struggles in the latter campaign fueled in part by Mitt Romney's \"47 percent\" comments.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Walker is the son of a Baptist minister and an Eagle Scout, who attended Marquette University for three years before dropping out to take a job with the Red Cross. Walker has taken to citing his humble beginnings during recent appearances, setting up a contrast between his background and that of one of his key 2016 rivals -- Bush.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"I realize unlike some out there I didn't inherit fame or fortune from my family,\" Walker said during a speech to a Christian broadcasters convention in February. \"I got a bunch of things that were a whole lot better than that. I got from my parents and my grandparents the belief that if you work hard and you play by the rules, here in America you can do and be anything you want.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Walker  has already experienced challenges that come with being thrust into the national spotlight in the months leading up to his campaign's official launch.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Unlike some of his peers in the Republican field like Bush, who lived through the White House campaigns of his father and brother, or former 2012 presidential candidates Rick Perry or Rick Santorum, Walker is facing head-on for the first time the reality of just how much scrutiny comes with a presidential campaign.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">And it's shown.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference in February, Walker raised eyebrows when <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/02/26/politics/scott-walker-2016-protestors-terrorists/\">he seemed to compare the task</a> of fighting ISIS to taking on thousands of protesters in his state.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Earlier that month, a trip to London resulted in a slew of unflattering headlines when Walker, despite his best efforts to avoid making news during the overseas trip, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/02/11/politics/scott-walker-london-visit/And\">punted on a question about the theory of evolution</a>.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">In March, several news outlets, including CNN, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/03/26/politics/election-2016-scott-walker-immigration/\">reported that at a private gathering</a> in New Hampshire, Walker had endorsed a pathway for citizenship for undocumented immigrants. This would have marked a notable reversal for Walker who had staked out a more conservative position on the divisive issue, and pundits were quick to suggest that the governor had flip flopped.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Joe McQuaid, publisher of the New Hampshire Union Leader whose office is a must-visit early state stop for presidential candidates, remarked at the time that the controversy surrounding Walker's reported immigration remarks showed that this is the governor's \"first time outside of Wisconsin.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"It is a guy in his first presidential campaign trying to get himself grounded and see where he needs to be nuanced,\" McQuaid said in a recent interview. \"He hasn't dealt with these issues on a regular basis.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Walker could give Bush a run for his money.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Over the past few months, the governor has made aggressive overtures to wealthy financiers and prominent Republican donors, presenting himself as a conservative alternative to others in the field.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Bush's extensive fundraising network, founded on decades-old family friendships, will be difficult to compete with. But in the earliest stages of the campaign, Walker's political action committee, Our American Revival, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/03/16/politics/scott-walker-pac-donors-bundlers/\">has boasted impressive commitments and donations </a>from prominent donors and bundlers in fundraising epicenters like New York, California and Texas.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">And it's not just deep-pocketed donors that Walker is banking on.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The recall fight that made the governor a national figure could be a boon for his fundraising efforts among small-dollar donors.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Walker raised more than $30 million for the recall campaign, which helped him grow his donor to list to some 300,000 supporters. Walker and his supporters say they're eager to win over a new generation of donors.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"Our donor is not the tried and true Republican donor in New York City that's given to everybody since Reagan, Anthony Scaramucci, the founder of the investment firm SkyBridge Capital who is raising money for Walker, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/07/politics/scott-walker-campaign-fundraising-strategy/index.html\">told CNN earlier this month</a>. \"We don't have the mercenary donor that's paying for past political favors.\"  </p>"], "article_highlights": ["Wisconsin Gov.

I'm not aware of all the details of the arrangement,\" Earnest said.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">But there's a problem with that advice: Clinton's office is not taking many calls these days, in what appears to be a concerted effort to allow the email storm to pass before she declares her expected intention to run for president.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\"><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/03/04/politics/election-2016-hillary-clinton-critics/\" target=\"_blank\">RELATED: Hillary Clinton's stumbles fuel Democratic critics</a></p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"I want the public to see my email. I asked State to release them. They said they will review them for release as soon as possible,\" Clinton tweeted late Wednesday night.  Beyond that, her aides have offered only a few brief on-the-record explanations.  </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"For government business, she emailed [State Department staff] on their Department accounts, with every expectation they would be retained,\" Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill said in a statement earlier this week. \"When the Department asked former Secretaries last year for help ensuring their emails were in fact retained, we immediately said yes.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">A handful of Clinton defenders have cautiously stepped forward to fill the void.  \"Hillary will at some point need to say why she didn't use an official address. People are curious. But I think that is all,\" said Hilary Rosen, a past Clinton surrogate and Democratic strategist.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"The media is driving the frenzy,\" another Democratic strategist, Donna Brazile, added.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Still, the sudden collision of Obama's and Clinton's worlds over the email controversy is steeped in irony. An Obama team that eight years ago would've used the flap for maximum political advantage is now providing cover for its former adversary.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">In part, that's due to the merging of key operatives from both orbits into Clinton's expected campaign team. A well-placed Democratic source said another key factor is Clinton's team is still taking shape. It would be a mistake, the source said, for Clinton to crank up her operation now, simply to respond to questions about her email practices.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The relative calm expressed publicly by the White House and other key parts of the Obama administration in response to the email questions is a departure from one recent flare-up that defined the complicated Obama-Clinton alliance.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">It was only last August when Clinton took aim at the White House foreign policy mantra \"<a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2014/08/12/david-axelrod-smack-tweets-hillary-clinton/\">don't do stupid stuff</a>.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"Great nations need organizing principles, and 'Don't do stupid stuff' is not an organizing principle,\" Clinton told the Atlantic magazine.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"Just to clarify: 'Don't do stupid stuff' means stuff like occupying Iraq in the first place, which was a tragically bad decision,\" David Axelrod, one of the president's top former aides, tweeted in response. </p>"], "article_highlights": [], "article_author": ["Jim Acosta"]}

There's already a Keystone pipeline?</strong></p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">That's right. Keystone XL represents just under a third of the entire Keystone project, and every other piece of pipe has been built and laid out. In fact, TransCanada's pipeline system is already shipping hundreds of thousands of barrels of crude oil from the Canadian oil sands across the U.S. border -- and into Illinois. The current Keystone XL proposal would run the pipeline through Montana, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\"><strong>Oil sands ...<strong></strong> <strong></strong>that sounds familiar.</strong></p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">That's because oil sands are one of environmentalists' biggest gripes over the proposed Keystone XL pipeline since extracting crude oil from the oil sands (oil + sand = oil sands) pumps about 17% more greenhouse gases into the air than standard crude oil extraction, according to a State Department review of the project.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">And either way, the State Department concluded the oil sands will be developed regardless of whether the pipeline goes through.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">But that's not all that's prompted environmentalists to protest Keystone XL and <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2014/11/17/politics/protesters-mary-landrieu-keystone/\">deploy an inflatable pipeline </a>on Sen. Mary Landrieu's front yard last November when she was leading the charge to pass the bill.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Environmentalists, local residents and indigenous tribes are also protesting the pipeline's planned route, which would cut across the Ogallala Aquifer, which is one of the world's largest.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\"><strong>Aqui-what?</strong></p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\"><a href=\"http://education.nationalgeographic.com/education/encyclopedia/aquifer/?ar_a=1\" target=\"_blank\">Aquifer</a> is just a fancy term for an underground layer of porous rock trapping large deposits of water that can often be accessed through wells -- there are about 2,500 within a mile of the would-be Keystone XL route. Aquifers are a key source of fresh water, and environmentalists are concerned the pipeline could pollute those reserves.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">But the State Department <a href=\"http://keystonepipeline-xl.state.gov/documents/organization/221135.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">concluded</a> in January -- amid continued objections from environmentalists -- that the impact on water quality \"would be limited.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\"><strong>You said indigenous tribes were also protesting the project?</strong></p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Yes. Native Americans are concerned about the societal impact of camps with thousands of construction workers living near their communities, which face a high rate of sexual assaults from non-indigenous men, representatives of the activist Wica Agli group said in an interview earlier this week.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\"><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2014/11/18/politics/angus-king-keystone-vote-no/index.html?hpt=po_c1\">Angus King a 'no' on Keystone XL vote</a></p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">And the pipeline would also run through the sovereign lands of some tribes. The Rosebud Sioux Tribe even declared that the House bill to approve Keystone XL last week amounted to a declaration of war.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\"><strong>War? Sounds serious. If it comes to that, will the economic benefits be worth it at least?</strong></p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Depends what you consider to be \"worth it.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The State Department concluded in January the project would create about 42,000 jobs directly and indirectly during the construction phase (indirect: think commercial benefits for restaurants, shops, etc.). That total includes 3,900 construction jobs to actually build the pipeline.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\"><a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2014/11/18/news/economy/keystone-jobs/index.html?iid=HP_LN&amp;hpt=hp_t1\" target=\"_blank\">Fact checking Keystone jobs claims</a></p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">All in all, the pipeline would inject $2 billion in total economic benefits, according to the State Department <a href=\"http://keystonepipeline-xl.state.gov/documents/organization/221135.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">review.</a></p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">But once the construction -- which would last no more than two years -- wraps up, Keystone XL will have created just 50 permanent jobs -- the number needed to maintain the pipeline.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Either way, the State Department's conclusions seriously undercut TransCanada's<a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2011/11/10/news/economy/keystone_pipeline/index.htm?iid=EL\"> claims</a> in 2011 that the project would create about 140,000 direct and indirect jobs.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\"><strong>So if this pipeline goes through, what are the risks of an oil spill?</strong></p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Not too high. The State Department concluded the Keystone XL proposal \"would include processes, procedures, and systems to prevent, detect, and mitigate potential oil spills.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\"><strong>And will the pipeline help lower gas prices in the U.S.?</strong></p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Not really. The State Department said Keystone XL would have \"little impact\" on domestic gas prices.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\"><strong>Alright, so the State Department released its findings on Keystone XL's impact in January. What's the hold up?</strong></p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The State Department concluded its review of the pipeline's impact in January, but was waiting on a Nebraska Supreme Court case over the pipeline's route to determine whether the pipeline project is in the U.S. national interest.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">That supreme court approved the pipeline's route through the state earlier this month, and the State Department has been reviewing that decision as it makes its final determinations.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The State Department said the pipeline was not in the U.S. national interest in 2011, but TransCanada renewed its <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/11/13/us-usa-keystone-chronology-timeline-idUSKCN0IX2JX20141113\" target=\"_blank\">application</a> in May 2012 after making changes to the proposed route.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The State Department concluded in January 2014 that the Keystone XL pipeline would have a negligible impact on the environment</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The White House has insisted it will let the State Department's process play it before Obama makes a final decision on whether or not to approve the pipeline.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The State Department is expected to conclude its final review soon, once it finishes reviewing comments from various federal agencies including the Environmental Protection Agency, which urged the State Department in a February letter to reconsider the negative environmental impact the pipeline would have. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Obama has said his top concern in making a decision will be \"does it contribute to the greenhouse gases that are causing climate change.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">For now at least, Obama will veto the Congressional legislation and Keystone XL is facing a dim future.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\"><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2014/11/18/politics/senate-keystone-vote/index.html?hpt=po_c1\">Why Keystone XL matters</a></p>"], "article_highlights": ["The State Department reported the project would have minimal environmental impacts", "Proponents have touted economic benefits, but the proposal would generate few permanent jobs", "The production of oil from oil sands emits more greenhouse gases "], "article_author": ["Jeremy Diamond"]}

The poll finds 21% approve of how Congress is handling its job, up from 13% before the election and the highest rating in CNN/ORC polling since January 2013.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">But the issue at the center of the standoff, immigration, divides the country. The poll finds a near even split on how the U.S. government should handle illegal immigration.

I think you let the process play out and if there is an opening, then coalesce. I think you try to do it, but I am not confident.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">This lack of certainty has some leaders in the social conservative movement already engaged in discussions about how to avoid diluting their power, especially in Iowa and South Carolina.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">For these leaders, the hope is to prevent a repeat of 2012 when Mitt Romney -- considered the more centrist, establishment candidate -- won the nomination in a crowded field of self-described social conservatives. Romney was initially declared the winner of the Iowa caucuses by a mere eight votes over Santorum, who made social conservatism a major part of his campaign.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Several weeks later, after all the caucus votes were certified, it was announced that Santorum, not Romney, had actually won Iowa. But it was too late. Romney had the wind at his back and eventually went on to win the nomination.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">A review of the 2012 Iowa caucus entrance poll shows that Santorum won the white evangelical and born Christian vote with 32%, while the remaining support split among five of his rivals: Ron Paul, 19%; Newt Gingrich, 14%; Perry, 14%; and Michele Bachmann, 5%.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\"><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2014/12/19/politics/michele-bachmann-exit-interview-with-dana-bash/\">WATCH: Michele Bachmann's not so quiet exit</a></p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">What if the white evangelical and born again voters had backed Santorum over one of the other five candidates? </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">It is not clear if a win in Iowa would have changed the ultimate outcome of Romney winning the nomination. After all, he had the money, infrastructure, and backing of the GOP establishment. But naming Romney the initial winner of the caucuses deprived Santorum the chance to fully seize on an important moment in the campaign.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"At the time, we thought it was ok,\" said Hogan Gidley, a senior aide on Santorum's presidential campaign. \"We got all of the publicity and we called it a win, because we were outspent by so much.

The most influential group is the Council for National Policy, whose membership includes leaders representing prominent social conservative organizations. GOP candidates are invited to address the CNP in private meetings.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"My goal will be to give conservative leaders every opportunity to see the candidates, to get to know them and to do an apples to apples comparison at the right time,\" said Perkins, who also serves as the CNP's president. \"If that time comes, encourage people to get behind a candidate.

As one activist noted, \"You bleed with them in battle. There are alliances, friendships ... people who worked hard for you. You don't want to burn them.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">But this lack of early unity in the Christian conservative ranks gives the candidates time to sell their vision of governing to this important Republican constituency.

And you need to have muscle, infrastructure, ground game and money to win. If you don't have one of these it will be very hard.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Over and over again, Christian conservative activists and leaders emphasized that they are not a single issue constituency group -- noting that candidates need to weave their personal position on social issues into their overall governing plan.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"Evangelical voters are concerned about other issues: the economy, immigration, foreign policy and the U.S. decline on the world stage,\" said Dr. Tony Beam, an ordained Southern Baptist minister who hosts a morning drive Christian talk radio program in Greenville, South Carolina.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Huckabee's decision to give up a lucrative television deal at Fox News Channel sends a powerful signal to religious leaders who may have questioned whether he was truly committed to running for President.

Meanwhile, the feminism label doesn't seem as charged as it once was -- people from Beyonce to actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt are identifying as feminist.  </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"As far as the political culture and culture in general, this is as good a time as any for a women to run for the highest office. There is a willingness now to promote pro-women messages,\" said Jennifer Lawless, who runs the Women &amp; Politics Institute at American University.  \"People are ready for a woman president.  The question is this: Are they ready for Hillary as that woman?\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">According to a recent Pew poll, nearly three quarters of Americans expect to see a woman president in their lifetime. But that hope splits along partisan -- not gender -- lines. Only 20% of Republican women hope to see a woman president and nearly 70% of Democratic women do. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\"><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/interactive/2015/04/politics/hillary-clinton-2016-election-announcement/\">INTERACTIVE: Hillary Clinton tries again</a></p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">In the run-up to her announcement and at women-centered events, Clinton sometimes strode on stage to the song \"I'm Every Woman,\" and recalled how she juggled work and motherhood as a young lawyer. She has acknowledged a double standard for women and advised women to be tough.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">She has also frequently mentioned her granddaughter, Charlotte, as the reason she wants to remain in public life, a theme that will no doubt be heard on the campaign trail as she kicks off a tour in Iowa this week with small events. She made pushing for the expansion of the rights of women and girls part of her diplomatic work as secretary of state, as detailed in her book \"Hard Choices.\" </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Her new campaign website is plastered with pictures of women, with Clinton, in a blue cloth coat, holding a cup of coffee listening intently to another woman as a man looks on.  </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The emphasis on women -- and the progress of women -- as a possible underlying campaign theme is a reversal of her 2008 strategy, which stressed experience and competence over history.

An email exchange between Beck and a law firm representing Trump shows a lunch order was made and set to arrive around noon.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Garten disputed that, insisting the only pre-scheduled break was one set for 3 p.m. for Beck to pump breast milk privately in a separate room.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">And Trump was intent on proceeding through the deposition without any additional breaks, according to a transcript of the deposition CNN obtained through public records.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">He even refused to take a break when one of his attorneys requested to go to the bathroom, instead insisting another lawyer could take over and allow the deposition to continue.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\"><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/28/politics/donald-trump-michael-cohen-disagree-debate/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Trump on debate preparation: 'I am what I am'</a></p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Trump's testimony stemmed from a lawsuit over a failed real estate project in Florida in which the Becks represented clients who claimed they lost tens of thousands of dollars each. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The breast-pumping incident wasn't the only time Trump insulted the attorney during the deposition, according to a transcript of the deposition obtained by CNN.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">After first calling Beck's questions \"very stupid,\" Trump then questioned Beck's competence.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"Do you even know what you're doing?\" he asked her at one point.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">In the end, the Becks lost one of their cases against Trump and are appealing.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">News of the \"disgusting\" remark came on the heels of another rhetorical controversy swirling around Trump.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Facing questions about a decades-old rape accusation against Trump, one of his top aides and attorneys Michael Cohen<a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/07/27/ex-wife-donald-trump-made-feel-violated-during-sex.html\" target=\"_blank\"> told the Daily Beast</a> that legally <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/28/politics/donald-trump-adviser-michael-cohen-rape/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">\"you cannot rape your spouse.\"</a> In fact, marital rape has been illegal in all 50 states for more than two decades.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\"><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/28/politics/donald-trump-adviser-michael-cohen-rape/index.html\">Trump distances himself from aide's rape comment</a></p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Cohen apologized Tuesday for the remark, calling his comments \"inarticulate\" but insisting that he had been enraged by the reporter's \"gall\" to ask a question about the accusation.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The rape claim stems from an accusation Trump's then-wife Ivana Trump leveled at her husband during divorce proceedings in the early 1990s, an allegation she walked back Tuesday.</p>"], "article_highlights": ["In a 2011 deposition, an opposing lawyer wanted to take a break to pump breast milk ", "\"You're disgusting,\" Trump responded, according to The New York Times", "Trump lawyer: It's not breast feeding or pumping that's gross, but rather the timing"], "article_author": ["Jeremy Diamond"]}

What is everyone upset about? </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">California Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer pointed out the potential health risks of laying the pipeline, including heart disease, increased hospitalization, and a higher prevalence of chemicals that \"penetrate deeply into the lungs.\"  </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"The facts are the facts are the facts,\" she said. \"If you're not a scientist than be humble and listen to the peer-reviewed scientists. They don't have a special interest. They have an interest in giving us information we should base our decisions upon. \"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Boxer also referred to the project as the \"Keystone Extra Lethal Pipeline.\" </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\"><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2014/11/17/politics/landrieu-pipeline-yard-protest-reelection-prospects/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Keystone protesters have message for Democrats</a></p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The GOP-led House on Friday approved a measure that will skip the conclusion of the six-year-old State Department review of the pipeline and authorize its construction. If the Senate ultimately approves the measure, Obama could be poised to issue what would be just the third veto of his nearly six year presidency.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">At a news conference last week, Obama made clear that he doesn't want Congress to interfere with the State Department's process. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"Understand what this project is: It is providing the ability of Canada to pump their oil, send it through our land, down to the Gulf, where it will be sold everywhere else. It doesn't have an impact on U.S. gas prices,\" Obama said at a Friday news conference in Myanmar.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The showdown comes as Obama and congressional Republicans appear to be on a collision course over immigration. Republicans are considering how to respond if Obama follows through with a pledge to revise immigration policies by the end of the year. Some GOP lawmakers have talked about potentially shutting down the government if Obama keeps that promise.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">On Keystone, Senate Democrats are moving toward a vote largely to help Landrieu, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources chairwoman. She is facing off in the December runoff against Republican Rep. Bill Cassidy, who sponsored the House's Keystone bill and has been promised a seat of his own on the energy panel. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The measure offers Landrieu a final chance to demonstrate her clout before voters return to the polls. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Already, Landrieu was joined by 10 Democratic co-sponsors: Alaska Sen. Mark Begich, Arkansas Sen. Mark Pryor, Indiana Sen. Joe Donnelly, Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill, Montana Sen. Jon Tester, Montana Sen. John Walsh, North Carolina Sen. Kay Hagan, North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, Virginia Sen. Mark Warner and West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Three more Democrats had pledged last week to support the measure: Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet, Delaware Sen. Tom Carper and Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The list of Landrieu's potential Democratic allies to provide the final vote is dwindling rapidly. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">One of Landrieu's top targets, West Virginia Sen. Jay Rockefeller, said he won't support the measure. Another potential backer, Maine Sen. Angus King, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, <a href=\"http://cnn.it/1t9hEws\" target=\"_blank\">told CNN Tuesday he will vote against the bill</a>. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Landrieu's entreaties to other Democrats have also been rejected in recent days. Outgoing Michigan Sen. Carl Levin won't support the pipeline, a spokeswoman said Monday. Nor will New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, who tweeted his opposition over the weekend. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Also confirming their opposition to the measure to various news outlets were Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Florida Sen. Bill Nelson, New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, Delaware Sen. Chris Coons, New Jersey Sen. Robert Menendez and Colorado Sen. Mark Udall. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Retiring Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa said he wouldn't be voting for the pipeline. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"I've come to this conclusion: every dollar that we spend on fossil fuel development and use is another dollar we spend digging the graves of our grandchildren,\" he told reporters Tuesday. \"And I'm not going to be a part of it anymore. I'm through. That's just how strong I feel. I know we can't solve it overnight, but we have to be on a steep glide path in getting rid of fossil fuels as a source of energy for our planet.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Even Landrieu's Democratic supporters were facing pressure. Anti-Keystone activists, including college students, were trying Tuesday to convince Carper and Bennet to change their minds, protesting at the senators' Capitol Hill offices. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"We've been playing politics for too long and this is not a political game ... this is affecting everyone,\" student Rachael Scheinman told CNN inside Bennet's office, holding a sign that read, \"Sen. Bennet, if you're not a climate denier, don't vote like one.\" </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"[Bennet] needs to vote his conscience on this one,\" added student Elli Bloomberg. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\"><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2014/11/18/politics/boehner-keystone-veto-is-equivalent-to-calling-americans-stupid/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Boehner: A Keystone veto is 'equivalent to calling American people stupid'</a></p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The peaceful scene in Bennet's office was in contrast to a more rambunctious protest in Carper's office, where protestors loudly chanted, \"You can't eat money, you can't drink oil,\"  \"Keep the tarsands in the soil, we don't want this dirty oil,\" and  \"What do we want?\" \"Climate justice,\" \"When do we want it?\" \"Now.\" </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Staffers attempted to speak to protesters in Carper's office and explain his vote. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"What I hear you saying is that the senator is politicizing an environmental crisis,\" one protester said. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"If he believes the science, there's no reason for him to be voting like this and mortgaging our future,\" said another. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Capitol police arrested four of the activists inside Carper's office. They were escorted outside to chants of \"climate heroes.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Despite their intentions to vote against the bill, both Boxer and Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) congratulated Landrieu for bringing the bill to the Senate floor in a move that Democrats hope will rally votes in her favor in her upcoming runoff. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Senate approval of the Keystone pipeline is all but guaranteed, with Republicans set to take control of the chamber in January. The only question appears to be timing. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">As Landrieu and her allies search for Democratic support, the pipeline is also becoming an issue in the 2016 campaign. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie announced Monday that he is planning a two-day swing through Canada in December. That trip is expected to included an energy speech that addresses the Keystone pipeline. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"My view is that we are missing an enormous opportunity when we delay development of the Keystone XL pipeline,\" Christie said in a speech during a recent trip to Mexico. \"Not only is Keystone a major job creator, delays in its approval sends an unfortunate signal on multiple fronts.\" </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\"><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2014/11/18/politics/keystone-pipeline-senate-vote-explainer/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Keystone XL pipeline debate: What do I need to know?</a></p>"], "article_highlights": ["The Senate is set to vote Tuesday on a bill that would authorize construction of the Keystone XL pipeline", "The bill is being championed by Democratic Sen.

On Tuesday night the former secretary of state delivered a much-watched speech in Washington, but did not mention her emails, instead focusing on politics and teasing her likely presidential run.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">After the State Department requested all secretaries of state send in their documents in 2014, Clinton and her team turned over 55,000 pages of emails to the State Department in December 2014. It is those emails that the former secretary of state wants released to the public.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">But because the emails were housed on her private account, the process was overseen by Clinton and her aides, not archivists like it would have been if the email was housed on government servers.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">A Clinton aide said that \"anything that pertained to her work there\" was given to State.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"So if she emailed with her daughter about flower arrangements for her wedding, that didn't go in,\" the aide said, \"but if she emailed one of the 100 State Department officials she regularly corresponded with, State had it in their servers already and HRC's office replicated that to ensure it was all there.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The fact, though, that Clinton was in control of her own archives has concerned some archive and cybersecurity experts.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The issue has grown from one focused on Clinton to something the White House has had to answer to, as well. Josh Earnest, White House press secretary, said on Tuesday that the administration's policy \"allows individuals to use their personal e-mail address as long as those e-mails are maintained and sent to the State Department, which if you ask Secretary Clinton's team, that's what they completed in the last month or two.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">A senior White House official told CNN on Thursday that aides to the President have been in touch with Clinton's staff \"to confirm facts and let them know what we planned to say.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Most Democrats don't want to talk about Clinton's email controversy. She is the party's prohibitive presidential favorite in 2016 and she leads every poll about the race, making it hard for other Democrats to draw her ire or knock her and risk hurting their party's best chance at keeping the White House.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">When CNN's Ted Barrett tried to ask congressional Democrats about the controversy,<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/03/04/politics/hillary-clinton-email-congressional-democrat-reaction/\"> the responses were far from eager</a>.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"I'm not up to speed on it. I'm really not,\" said Sen. Jon Tester of Montana, who runs the Senate Democrats' campaign committee. \"Check back.\" </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"I don't know enough about what those rules are, honestly, to comment,\" said North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">When CNN tried to ask Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who some liberals are hoping will challenge Clinton for the 2016 nomination, a staffer shielded her and deliberately blocked the senator from answering. Warren climbed into an elevator without looking up.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Clinton supporters have vocally supported her. New York Rep. Steve Israel said, \"Pretty soon we'll have a special investigative committee for every action that Hillary Clinton takes. There will be a special select committee on her breakfast, her lunch and her dinner and what she had in between.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">But the email controversy has emboldened the wing of the Democratic party looking for a Clinton alternative in 2016.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Some early primary state Democrats told CNN's Peter Hamby that the controversy shows the need for a competitive primary that will help vet Clinton for the general election.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"The Democratic base that isn't wedded to her is nervous about it,\" said Deborah Arnie Arnesen, a progressive radio host in Concord, New Hampshire. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"These are problems that raise real leadership and transparency concerns, concerns that can be addressed in caucuses and primaries, but would go ignored in a coronation process,\" said<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/03/04/politics/election-2016-hillary-clinton-critics/\"> Boyd Brown, a Democratic National Committee member and former state legislator from South Carolina.</a></p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The National Archives and Records Administration, the government agency that regulates the Federal Records Act, issued guidance in 2009 -- the same year Clinton took over at State -- that did not outlaw use of personal email accounts.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"Agencies that allow employees to send and receive official electronic mail messages using a system not operated by the agency must ensure that federal records sent or received on such systems are preserved in the appropriate agency recordkeeping system,\" the regulations said. It is unclear if there was a time requirement for the preservation of the emails.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Before 2009, according to Miriam Kleiman, spokeswoman for the National Archives, the agency did not \"specifically address this issue.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"But agencies have always had the responsibility to manage federal records created or received outside of agency systems, including email on nonofficial systems,\" she added.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">It wasn't until August 2013 -- after Clinton left State -- that the records administration <a href=\"http://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/bulletins/2013/2013-03.html\" target=\"_blank\">issued a bulletin </a>that personal email can only be used in \"emergency situations,\" and when used, the emails \"are captured and managed in accordance with agency record-keeping practices.\" </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Late last year -- long after Clinton left the State Department -- President Barack Obama signed an update to the Federal Records Law to prohibit the use of private email accounts by government officials unless they copy or forward any such emails into their government account within 20 days.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Jason R. Baron, a lawyer at Drinker Biddle &amp; Reath and the former director of litigation at the National Archives and Records Administration, said on Tuesday that it doesn't appear Clinton violated the law because \"the Federal Records Act is amorphous enough.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Baron did say, however, that the exclusive use of a personal email system is out of the ordinary.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"I was in the government for 34 years and in my experience, as director of litigation, I cannot recall an instance where a high-level official -- or anyone -- solely used a private email account for the transaction of government business,\" he said.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The House select committee investigating the 2012 terrorist attack in Benghazi issued subpoenas for Clinton's email on Wednesday. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"The Select Committee on Benghazi today issued subpoenas for all communications of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton related to Libya and to the State Department for other individuals who have information pertinent to the investigation,\" said Jamal Ware, the committee's communications director, in a statement. \"The committee also has issued preservation letters to Internet firms informing them of their legal obligation to protect all relevant documents.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Rep. Trey Gowdy, chairman of the committee, told CNN on Wednesday, before the subpoenas were announced, that he was willing to do whatever it took to get the documents.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"We are going to use every bit of legal recourse at our disposal to make sure\" the committee gets all the documents, Gowdy said. If that requires \"sending legal resource to the secretary herself, that is what we are going to do.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Democrats on the committee said Wednesday that they received \"no notice\" from Gowdy that the committee was preparing subpoenas for Clinton's documents.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"I did not want to believe it, but everything I've seen so far has led me to believe that this is an effort to go after Hillary Clinton. Period.  And I think that's very very unfortunate,\" said Rep. Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the select committee. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">A spokesman for Clinton did not respond to CNN questions about the subpoenas, but Clinton's team has been in contact with the committee. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">After Gowdy said Clinton used multiple private email addresses at State, Clinton's lawyer David E. Kendall sent Republicans and Democrats on the House committee investigating Benghazi a statement on Wednesday morning refuting Gowdy's claim.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"Secretary Clinton used one email account when corresponding with anyone, from department officials to friends to family,\" Kendall wrote in an email that explained how after Clinton's email address was published in a 2013 Gawker story, \"she changed the address on her account.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"At the time the emails were provided to the department last year this new address appeared on the copies as the 'sender,' and not the address she used as secretary,\" Kendall continued. \"This address on the account did not exist until March 2013, after her tenure as secretary.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Committee Republicans stood by Gowdy's claim, however, and reacted to Clinton's tweet about releasing her emails on Thursday.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"The former secretary's tweet does not answer questions about why this was not done when she left office, the integrity of the emails while she controlled them, the scheme to conceal them, or the failure to provide them in logical course,\" said Jamal D. Ware, communications director for the Republicans on the committee. \"Legitimate investigations do not consider partial records. And that is the point of the subpoena issued yesterday by the Benghazi Committee.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">By using a private email system, Clinton and her aides had access to all emails that would have been backed up by the government if she had used an official account.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">While she is not the first secretary of state to use a private email address -- former Secretaries Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice both had private emails -- Clinton is the first to exclusively use a private account. As opposed to Clinton, both Rice and Powell had and used an official government email address.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">An aide to Rice told CNN on Thursday that the former secretary of state \"rarely used email during her tenure at State\" and \"on the very rare occasion she did, her State email was the vehicle for official communication. She did not use personal email for official communication as secretary.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Rice's aide said her office received the 2014 request from State to send in documents but \"had nothing to turn over\" to the department.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Powell, however, did use personal email to communicate with staff at State, but also had an official account.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">A senior aide from the State Department said \"Secretary Powell wrote in his book about his efforts to bring the State Department into the email age. He writes about how he installed a personal laptop in his State Department office to use his personal email to connect with his principal assistants, ambassadors and foreign ministers.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">State spokeswoman Harf said this week that \"Secretary Kerry is the first secretary of state to rely primarily on a state.gov email account.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Kerry responded to the Clinton controversy while traveling in Saudi Arabia on Thursday by sarcastically downplaying the importance of the story compared to his current mission abroad to deal with Iran's nuclear program.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"I believe we have all the emails, all the ones that are state.gov which are appropriately in purview of the department,\" he said. \"But let me check on that when I actually have time to pay attention to such an important issue when I get home.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Republicans wasted no time in jumping on an issue they see as a winning one. Their goal is to paint Clinton in the same way they painted her husband: A dishonest politician who pushes ethical boundaries and feels the rules don't apply to her.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The Republican National Committee sent the State Department Inspector General a letter on Thursday demanding an investigation into Clinton's use of private email. The letter, from John Phillippe, chief counsel at the RNC, questions whether Clinton violated \"the requirement to archive emails that are federal records under the Federal Records Act.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"The American public deserves to know whether one of its top-ranking public official's actions violated federal law,\" the letter said. \"With transparency and openness in government being one of President Obama's guiding principles, it is incumbent upon your office to determine the facts surrounding this issue.\"</p>"], "article_highlights": ["\"I want the public to see my email,\" Clinton tweeted", "AP: Server for her personal email address was housed at her home "], "article_author": ["Dan Merica", "Brianna Keilar"]}

Failure here would almost certainly doom his campaign. But if he manages to do better than expected -- or even stage an upset -- O'Malley could emerge as a real challenger for Clinton.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Given his reception here this past weekend, there could be a sliver of an opening.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">After O'Malley delivered a red meat political speech to a room packed with union workers, Keefer left with several O'Malley political signs tucked under her arms.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"He said a lot of things that I wanted to hear and got me all revved up to get out there and get the vote out for Democrats,\" said Keefer, who noted that O'Malley had given her second thoughts about who she might support in next year's Democratic caucus. \"He was wonderful tonight. Just wonderful and I never heard of him.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">A similar scene played out several times over O'Malley's two-day trip to Iowa this past weekend, as he criss-crossed the state, meeting with influential early Democratic voters. He entered many rooms as a blank slate and often walked out to favorable reviews.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">While O'Malley sees an opening in Iowa, 48 hours on the ground is just one step in his run for the White House. For now, national and Iowa polling consistently indicate Clinton is the prohibitive favorite to win the Democratic nomination.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Only 1% of Democratic voters picked O'Malley as the first choice to be their party's presidential nominee, according to a <a href=\"http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2015/images/03/17/poll.2016.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">March CNN/ORC</a> national poll. A <a href=\"http://images.businessweek.com/cms/2015-01-31/saturday-b-30496.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Bloomberg Politics/Des Moines Register poll </a>of Iowa Democrats offered similar results. Meanwhile, Clinton is lapping the potential field of candidates with a whopping 62% support among national Democrats in the CNN poll, while 56% of Iowa Democrats favored her.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\"><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/03/11/politics/martin-omalley-clinton-2016-campaign/index.html\">READ: O'Malley 'tired' of Clinton email talk</a></p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">O'Malley recognizes his current standing, but emphasized it is early in the process and that polling will not factor into whether he decides to run for the Democratic nomination.  </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"When you start off as potential candidate for president and your name recognition is low, you have to just go from county to county, from town to town and engage people in order to change that around,\" O'Malley said in an interview with CNN following a Democratic meeting in Tipton. \"I guess another way to say it is this: Look, it is not unusual for there to be an inevitable front-runner early in a contest who has fantastic name recognition, and is therefore inevitable right up until he or she is no longer inevitable.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">O'Malley said that's why he spent two days meeting with Democratic voters in both large and small settings in a state that can propel a candidate to the top of the leader board.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"It is also not unusual -- because of the intimate nature of the campaigns in these early states -- for someone the rest of the country has not yet come to know to suddenly become very well known if they are willing to do the hard work and deliver the needed message for our country in town after town after town across Iowa and New Hampshire,\" he said, before jumping in the car for his next event in Cedar Rapids.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The spark of interest by Iowa voters who saw O'Malley last weekend stems at least in part from his ability to connect with voters. But he's also benefiting from fear there won't be a competitive Democratic contest in Iowa, Clinton's absence from the stage here and apprehension that Clinton is not liberal enough.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\"><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/30/politics/hillary-clinton-iowa-alone/index.html\">READ: Hillary Clinton could end up alone in Iowa</a></p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"I think there is a little bit of hesitancy on the part of Democrats to jump on the Hillary bandwagon at this point because they are not convinced,\" said Larry Hodgden, chair of the Cedar County Democrats. \"For one thing she hasn't been out here talking to us, and we like to have people come out and see us, obviously. And we don't know exactly how strong she is going to be for the progressive ideas that most of your active Democrats in Iowa do have.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Iowa Democrats, even those who openly support Clinton, said they would like to see a contested race for the party presidential nomination. A candidate who is battle tested in the primary is inevitably stronger in the general election, Iowa Democrats said in numerous interviews with CNN. Coupled with this sentiment was a strong feeling that it was good for Iowa Democrats to have a competitive battle for the nomination. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">After all, Iowa Democrats have been sitting on the sideline since 2008 when there was a fierce battle between Clinton, then-Sen. Barack Obama and former Sen. John Edwards to win the caucus. In 2012, Obama faced no primary opposition in his successful bid to win a second term -- leaving all of the political oxygen to Republicans in that year's open contest for the GOP nomination.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"We are always looking for a second choice,\" said Clara Oleson, a retired lawyer from West Branch, who was staffing the 'Ready for Hillary' table at the Cedar County Democrats Off-Year Democratic Caucus. \"And we take our responsibility seriously to vet candidates.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Oleson cited Clinton's experience as secretary of state as one of the reasons why she is supporting Clinton's likely presidential bid. Yet Oleson warned it would be presumptuous to say a Clinton victory is a certainty in next year's caucus. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"There is no lock,\" she said. \"There is no inevitability. Not here.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Over his two-day campaign swing, O'Malley played to the left of the political center as he made his case to Iowa voters during this campaign swing. He railed against Wall Street, emphasized the need to rebuild the middle class, and highlighted his support for issues of particular import to women such as expanded childcare, paid leave, and equal pay. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"It is true that when women succeed, America succeeds,\" O'Malley said at the Davenport fundraiser, triggering a standing ovation.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">He also sought to highlight his work in office both as governor and as mayor of Baltimore -- an introduction of sorts to an audience that knew very little about him. And O'Malley repeated the need to cast aside triangulation -- a political strategy of centrism associated with former President Bill Clinton -- believed to be a veiled criticism of Hillary Clinton. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"Triangulation is not a strategy that will move America forward,\" O'Malley said in Davenport.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">The next morning, in the CNN interview, O'Malley would not say his criticism of triangulation was directed at Clinton. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"I am referencing a malady in our party that has allowed us to accept half solutions as full responsibility,\" he said.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">O'Malley was also careful in presenting his vision for the future, while not being critical of Obama, whose victory in the 2008 Iowa caucus helped him eventually win the Democratic nomination.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\"><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/03/03/politics/martin-omalley-not-running-senate-mikulski/index.html\">READ: O'Malley won't run for Mikulski's senate seat in 2016</a></p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"President Obama has done a lot of good and very difficult things to save us from a second Great Depression,\" O'Malley said in the CNN interview. \"The very fact that we have an economy creating jobs now for 60 months in a row is a really positive development. But with wages going down for 12 years, this work is not yet completed. ... We have to bring forward a different and better way of governing in order to get our economy to work for all of us again.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">At his final stop in Council Bluffs, O'Malley eyed a guitar in the corner of Dixie Quicks restaurant, where the Pottawattamie County Democrats were holding a fundraising dinner. He turned to his aide and asked, \"Can I play a song?\" The aide asked the band if that was OK and was given the thumbs up. O'Malley, who plays in a Celtic rock band that bears his name, had his closer.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Standing on a small, shaky chair so that the 70 or so people in the back could see him, O'Malley recited similar populist political themes that he had spoken about earlier in the day and the previous night. He then asked the confused audience if they wanted to hear a song and proceeded to play the guitar and sing Passenger's \"Scare Away the Dark.\" He even coaxed the audience to join him in singing the song's chorus.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">This was not O'Malley's first time visiting Iowa -- he was the keynote speaker at the Iowa Democratic Party's 2014 State Convention, donated more than $45,000 to Iowa Democrats in the last election cycle and paid the salaries of several Democratic staffers to work in Iowa. Early investments that may pay off if he decides to run for president.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">On this trip, O'Malley had a team of videographers chronicling his speeches and interactions with Iowa voters -- creating a library of fresh campaign footage if he decides to take the leap.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Asked to describe what his campaign would look like if he decides to run, O'Malley told CNN: \"It will be a campaign of ideas and a campaign of principle based on our national interests.\" </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Pressed if it would be a large operation or a run-gun grassroots campaign, O'Malley smiled and said, \"Well, first it will be a small campaign and then it will be a really large campaign.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">He reiterated that his timeline to make a decision to run for president would happen sometime this spring. Coincidentally, he returns to Iowa next month to headline a dinner for Polk County Democrats.</p>"], "article_highlights": [], "article_author": ["Mark Preston", "Alexander Rosen"]}

Parris Glendening said Gray's death \u2014 and the outrage surrounding it \u2014 calls for a \"national awakening\" on law enforcement and the treatment of racial minorities, and that O'Malley has \"tremendous credentials\" to lead a national dialogue on these issues. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"He understands what it is like to be the top elected official in a really challenging urban area, including the area of law enforcement,\" Glendening, a Democrat, said in an interview. \"What you've got here is a powder keg in the sense that the community doesn't trust the police and the police doesn't trust the community, amidst a growing sense of poverty and inequity and hopelessness.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">It's unclear just how prominent a public role O'Malley will seek in the coming days, as current Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake and Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan try to bring stability to a city in disarray. O'Malley spokeswoman Lis Smith said Tuesday that O'Malley has reached out to community leaders, including the mayor, to offer his help and that he's ready to participate in the \"healing process with the people of Baltimore.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">But the unrest in Baltimore could also hinder O'Malley's ability to talk about the city as a success story. Though he left the mayor's office in 2007, he has in some ways staked his reputation on the idea of Baltimore and Maryland as examples to the nation. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Former Maryland attorney general Doug Gansler said some of the anger and resentment over Gray's death might be traced back years to O'Malley's time as mayor. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Some believe that O'Malley's policing tactics, in particular, \"worsened the problem and that minorities were targeted and there was this friction and distrust that grew,\" said Gansler, a Democrat who ran unsuccessfully for governor in 2014.  </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">O'Malley rose to prominence as a tough-on-crime mayor who used data and analytics to tackle everything from drugs and murder to basic city services. And in recent public speeches, O'Malley has confronted head-on events that have reignited debates about racial discrimination and law enforcement tactics. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Speaking at the National Action Network summit in New York earlier this year, O'Malley discussed the killing of Walter Scott, an African-American man shot at eight times in the back by a South Carolina police officer. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"It's very, very hard, I think, for white people, any white people, to understand just what that loss of a precious life does to the constant state of random vulnerability that Americans of color feel,\" he said. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">O'Malley also said that his tenure as mayor was not simply about cracking down on crime or the prevalence of drugs in the city but addressing a broader issue of justice for racial minorities.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"We vowed together that we would not only improve policing, not only raise the standard of justice in a colorblind way that valued every life in our city and every neighborhood equally,\" he said, \"but we would also intervene earlier in the lives of young people, expand drug treatment, and do one other very, very important thing -- and that is to do a better job of policing the police.\" </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\"><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/28/politics/obama-baltimore-violent-protests/index.html\">READ: Obama: 'No excuse' for violence in Baltimore</a></p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">O'Malley has made his aggressive and data-focused management of city agencies a central part of his political story. But as mayor, his zero-tolerance policing strategy faced criticism from some activists even as the city saw a drop in crime.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Former Republican Maryland Gov. Robert Ehrlich, whom O'Malley defeated in 2006 and again in 2010, said he simply thought it was \"bad policy.\"</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"A lot of innocent people were arrested for nothing, for walking down the street, and that gets people angry,\" he said. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">O'Malley's allies insist, however, that the former governor's time as mayor will help distinguish him from the rest of the presidential field if he were to launch a White House campaign. </p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">Democratic strategist Doug Thornell, who has worked for the Congressional Black Caucus and as a top adviser to Maryland Rep. Chris Van Hollen, said O'Malley's background as a big city mayor would bring a valuable dimension to the dialogue within the Democratic Party about inequality.</p>", "<p class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"Hopefully it's a conversation that he can inject into the larger presidential conversation,\" Thornell said. \"You don't really hear a lot of people talking about urban America. You hear the conversation pop up when there's something like what's happened in Baltimore or Ferguson, but then the conversation stops.\"</p>"], "article_highlights": [], "article_author": ["MJ Lee"]}

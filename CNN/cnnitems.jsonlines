 "article_content": ["Marco Rubio finished third Monday night in Iowa, but he may have won the establishment credibility he needs to stay near the top of the Republican presidential race for the long-term.", "For the GOP establishment, Donald Trump's populist campaign is a non-starter. And Ted Cruz is loathed by the GOP party elite in Washington -- something he's happy to tout on the trail. ", "That leaves Rubio, and raises the stakes for New Hampshire, where he will aggressively argue he is the only viable alternative to Trump and Cruz and can unite the party unlike his more divisive rivals. ", "First, he needs to convince the party establishment to unite behind him. Campaign officials immediately began making the case that this is a three-person race and that the governors competing with him in New Hampshire -- John Kasich, Jeb Bush and Chris Christie -- cannot win.", "Rubio beat fairly low expectations for him in Iowa, while the other three governors barely showed any life in the Hawkeye State.  And he will pick up a major endorsement: ", "Rubio's team is expecting to become a big target after Monday night -- so much it has already decided to pare back on spending in South Carolina and put that money back on the air in New Hampshire. They will be up to $5.2 million in ad spending in New Hampshire to date after their new $100,000 investment.", "\"This is the moment they said would never happen,\" Rubio told supporters Monday evening. \"For months, they told us we had no chance.\" ", "Aides to both Trump and Ted Cruz now concede that Rubio will have some momentum in the state.", "\"Rubio is now going to be a play in New Hampshire. Trump is going to have to fend him off now,\" said one staffer for Trump, who leads most New Hampshire polls significantly.", "In some ways, Cruz's victory complicates Rubio's path to the nomination. The hope was for Cruz to end up in second place, something that would have been detrimental to his campaign and could have marked the beginning of the end for the Texas Republican. But with Cruz still in the race, it makes things a bit more challenging for Rubio. ", "That's because Rubio and Cruz compete for a lot of the same voters. And if Rubio ends up behind Cruz in New Hampshire, that could give Cruz even more life heading into South Carolina and then into SEC primary states. Increasingly, Rubio is looking at Nevada as his first state that could give him a victory. ", "Bush is already in New Hampshire, and the man who has viciously attacked his fellow Floridian is not ready to go down without a fight. Speaking of Rubio and Cruz Monday night, Bush said they don't have the experience to win. ", "\"And the two other candidates that are likely to emerge in Iowa are two people that are backbenchers that have never done anything of consequence in their life,\" Bush said. \"They're gifted beyond belief. They can give a great speech. But I think it's time for us to recognize that maybe what we need is someone who can lead.\"", "Sara Murray, Noah Gray and Ashley Killough contributed to this report"], "article_highlights": ["Marco Rubio finished third Monday night in Iowa, but he may have won the establishment credibility he needs to stay near the top of the Republican presidential race for the long-term", "Rubio will aggressively argue he is the only viable alternative to Trump and Cruz and can unite the party unlike his more divisive rivals"],

", "Ted Cruz's organizational strength, his well-funded super PAC and his retail politicking carried the day as the Texas senator bested the billionaire businessman, 28% to 24%, on the strength of evangelical voters. ", "Monday night's triumph also suggested there are limits to Trump's attacks, too -- showing that voters didn't penalize him for his Canadian birth and his relative lack of friends in Washington, as the real estate mogul had hoped. ", "But Cruz will find himself on shakier ground as the race shifts to New Hampshire, where Trump has a sizable lead in the polls and establishment candidates such as Rubio are likely to fare better with voters.", "For all of Cruz's success in Iowa, the results also underscored the threat posed by Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, another freshman of Cuban heritage, who finished a strong third with 23%.", "The winner of Iowa's Democratic caucuses might not be clear until every single one of the state's 1,681 precincts reports. ", "But for Hillary Clinton, a virtual tie -- in fact, a hairs-width lead, with 95% of precincts reporting -- was enough for her campaign to declare victory.", "The former secretary of state will slog overnight to New Hampshire, where victory looks much more difficult to pull off. But Clinton did something important: She blocked a scenario in which Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders left Iowa with not just a Granite State lead in the polls, but also huge momentum. ", "Going into the night, if you'd told Democratic strategists that 180,000 people would caucus, they'd have predicted a Sanders victory. ", "Instead, Clinton staved off a repeat of her disastrous 2008 loss in Iowa. Clinton told supporters she was \"breathing a big sigh of relief. Thank you, Iowa!\" ", "Had Sanders defeated Clinton by a clear margin in Iowa, she'd have been facing the prospect of losing both of the first two contests -- setting off major alarms among supporters and donors and risking a total loss of momentum, even as she looks to a firewall of minority support beyond those two states. ", "Sanders won a huge majority of younger caucus-goers. But Clinton's strong showing among older voters and women were enough to match the enthusiasm of Sanders' youthful supporters. ", "That cha-ching Marco Rubio is hearing is the Republican establishment reaching for its wallets.  ", "Rubio might have finished third in the real results, but he clearly won the expectations game -- which might matter most of all.  ", "Rubio finished a strong third place with 23% support -- very nearly nipping Trump for second place. He showed he can compete against Cruz for conservatives, and he actually won suburban Republicans, placing first in the population-dense Polk, Story and Dallas counties that are dominated by more moderate, establishment types. ", "Two good signs for Rubio: He got boosts from late deciders, about 3 in 10 of whom broke in his favor, and from those who value electability, winning 4 in 10 of those voters, according to early entrance polls. ", "He is also set to pick up the endorsement of South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, brightening Rubio's outlook in the state that follows New Hampshire. ", "Donald Trump might be the greatest show in politics -- but that didn't translate to a huge new pool of caucus-goers who could push him over the top. ", "Part of why Trump lost: Evangelical or born-again Christians made up two-thirds of the Republican electorate. Cruz won about one-third of those voters' support, according to entrance polls, while Trump -- despite campaigning with evangelical leader Jerry Falwell Jr. -- and Rubio netted about 20% each. ", "Cruz spokesman Rick Tyler taunted Trump's campaign, saying of the business mogul's supporters: \"They weren't real today, they won't be real next week and they won't be real the week after that.\"", "After stopping by several caucuses during the evening, Trump finished his night by giving a brief, polite speech thanking Iowans and suggesting he one day might buy a farm there even though he didn't win.

", "Rubio got 23%. The other three combined: 7%. ", "The trio have bet their campaigns on New Hampshire, hoping that the state would not only give them strong finishes but winnow the pack. ", "That strategy, though, was built in part on the idea that Trump and Cruz would break away from the pack in the Hawkeye State. It didn't account for the strength of Rubio's surge in the race's closing days. ", "Now, they'll have to contend with the reality that one member of the four-pack has already broken out, giving establishment Republicans still looking for their horse a clear leader. They might have to hope for a Rubio stumble to reshuffle their pecking order.

It's Bush's high-spending super PAC, Right to Rise, which has pummeled Rubio across the airwaves with tens of millions of dollars in attacks -- and officials say it will continue to do so long as the former Florida governor stays in the race.", "And if Bush continues his campaign beyond the Super Tuesday primary on March 1, as his confidantes promise he will, he could make it harder for Rubio to win what will be one of the biggest prizes in mid-March: Their home state of Florida, which awards all of its delegates to the winner rather than handing them out proportionally. The jockeying between Rubio and Bush -- one-time close political allies in the Sunshine State -- underscores what will soon become the dominant narrative after the Iowa caucuses: Who will become the choice of the party establishment?", "\"It will probably thin out to Jeb or Marco,\" said Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., a top Bush surrogate. \"You'll start to see some clarity in a couple weeks.\"", "The thinning-out process begins Monday night here in Iowa, and Rubio's team wants major separation between him and the governors in order to show that the senator is the only viable candidate who can take down Trump.", "According to a CNN average of the last five public polls in Iowa, Rubio is solidly in third place here, coming in at 15% -- well behind Cruz and Trump. But from the perspective of Rubio officials, a third-place is finish is fine with them -- as long as they are solidly ahead of the other establishment favorites, namely Bush, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who all will be competing for the No. 2 spot in New Hampshire.", "So far, Bush, Christie and Kasich have failed to gain much traction in Iowa, all registering in the low single digits in the polls -- something that could hurt their momentum going forward. But as they've struggled, all three have increasingly focused on New Hampshire, hoping the state's more moderate voters help propel them to finish right behind Trump, who is dominating so far in the state.", "A new CNN-WMUR poll released Sunday shows a muddled race for second and third place in New Hampshire. While Trump wins 30% of the vote, the next closest competitor is Cruz at 12%, followed by Rubio with 11% of the vote, Kasich at 9%, Christie at 8% and Bush at 6%. Just 39% of GOP voters say they've \"definitely\" decided on their candidate.", "From the Rubio perspective, they believe the senator can afford to finish behind Kasich in New Hampshire, who lacks much of an infrastructure beyond the Granite State and doesn't have deep support from the conservative base. While Christie does have greater support among conservatives, according to surveys, he too lacks much of an operation in states that vote after New Hampshire.", "Bush, on the other hand, has devoted ample time and resources traveling across the country, including last week where he went to the remote town of Elko, Nevada -- even though the state doesn't vote until Feb. 23. Bush and Rubio have traveled to states that vote in March in a much-faster clip than their rivals. Since mid-June, Bush has made 49 trips to March-voting states, compared to 31 to Rubio. Bush's campaign is investing heavily in Tennessee, a state that votes March 1, and has built coalitions in states as diverse as Colorado and Alabama.", "Even if they fall short in New Hampshire, they are increasingly banking on a big showing in South Carolina to turn around a campaign that has underperformed so far.", "\"South Carolina is a really natural fit for Jeb,\" said Kinzinger.", "Even if Bush struggles to break through in New Hampshire, his well-funded super PAC, Right to Rise, can keep him afloat -- and make Rubio's life difficult.", "The Bush super PAC has already spent $20 to $22 million attacking Rubio, according to the senator's campaign. Paul Lindsay, a spokesman for the super PAC, wouldn't confirm that number. But he signaled that it was just a start.", "\"It's less than the figure they quote, but we'll cut Marco some slack since we know he has a penchant for not being able to add up expenses very well,\" Lindsay said. \"We are very prepared for March and believe Jeb will be in a strong position at the end of February.\"", "The Rubio campaign has built an organization that the senator's team believes can sustain well beyond the first four states, even if he fails to win any of them. They've named campaign chairmen in all 50 states and have secured more state legislative endorsements than Bush since late December, totaling 228. The campaign has opened up three offices in South Carolina and two in Nevada, and now has 118 staff -- more than half are working on targeting voters on-the-ground.", "Rubio is spending money on TV in Nevada, unlike other campaigns, and is increasingly banking on a strong showing in the Silver State. Since December, Rubio also has traveled for events in Alabama, Florida, Michigan, Missouri, North Carolina, Texas and Minnesota. ", "And both Rubio and his campaign will likely have the resources to compete into March. His super PAC, Conservative Solutions PAC, reported $14 million in its bank account through the end of last year.", "Jeff Sadosky, a spokesman for the super PAC, said roughly 55 percent of all negative ads in Iowa were targeting Rubio -- and that the organization had the resources to respond in kind.", "\"That air cover has been incredibly important as Marco has found himself attacked by Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz and Hillary Clinton,\" Sadosky said of his organization's air war.", "The Rubio strategy comes down to this: They hope that they will continue to advance by staying in the top tier of candidates, while under-performing candidates -- namely the governors -- face growing pressure to drop out, allowing him to consolidate their support. They hope that will allow the party to unite behind his candidacy to take on the conservative favorite, potentially Trump.", "On Sunday, Rubio refused to say which state he could win when asked by CNN's Jake Tapper on \"State of the Union,\" saying he's \"not the campaign strategist.\" And while he said that he wouldn't call on anyone to drop out of the race, he added that unity behind an establishment favorite would happen at the \"appropriate time.\"", "\"Here's how we win: We win by having more delegates than anyone else, and more than half the delegates,\" Rubio said on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" signaling a long, grueling campaign. \"And I'm very comfortable and confident that we're going to achieve that.\"", "On Monday, the first task is seeing Cruz come in second to Trump in Iowa, something Rubio advisers believe will mean the beginning of the end for the Texas Republican's campaign. Yet if Cruz pulls off a victory Monday night, he will have upended the race, prompting Rubio and other campaigns to recalibrate.", "No matter what, Cruz said, he'll be in the game for the long run.", "\"We're running a national campaign,\" Cruz told Tapper Sunday."], "article_highlights": ["Jeb Bush is now viewed internally as Marco Rubio's biggest threat after the New Hampshire primary", "Bush is the only establishment candidate who has built a national organization"], "article_author": ["Manu Raju"]}

Adam Kinzinger had just introduced the former Florida governor at a town hall here Friday afternoon, and Bush explained that Kinzinger typically appears on news shows for him the mornings after debates. ", "\"Today was a little easier for him than the previous debates,\" Bush said. The audience, which was packed into a small, lodge-type venue, broke out into laughter and applause.", "Bush, who is polling in the low single digits just days before Monday's Iowa caucuses, seemed to ride post-debate high on Friday as he barnstormed the northwest corner of the state. It was the first Republican debate sans Donald Trump, and voters here felt that the absence of the larger-than-life frontrunner helped Bush break through.

Steve King's territory -- and King is heavily supporting Sen. Ted Cruz. ", "The former Florida governor, despite battling a cold, was in good spirits as he made his final pitch to caucus-goers. His aggressive schedule takes him from one end of the state to the other this weekend with shorter, more prolific town halls, thus giving him exposure to more voters.

Instead of staying in Iowa Monday night for the results, Bush -- like Ohio Gov. John Kasich and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie -- will hold an event in the Granite State that night.

His praise was effusive -- at times almost fawning -- as he essentially told the Davenport crowd that he was willing to take the heat over his decision. ", "Trump, he said at least twice, reminded him of his father, the famed televangelist and Southern Baptist pastor Jerry Falwell Sr. He cited private acts of generosity that he said Trump does not typically boast about -- from financial assistance that he said the mogul offered to a couple who helped him with his broken-down limousine to his aid for an inner city basketball team.

He explained that when he went into the voting booth, he wasn't trying to elect a Sunday school teacher, or pastor, or even somebody who shared his theological beliefs,\" Falwell said. \"He was trying to elect the most qualified person to be the president of the United States. We know Jimmy Carter was a great Sunday school teacher; but look how he did as President.\"", "Trump went a step further on Saturday by releasing a closing message to evangelicals on Facebook, showing the Bible that his mother had given him and thanking conservative Christians for supporting him.", "\"My mother gave me this Bible, this very Bible, many years ago. In fact it's her writing right here. She wrote the name and my address, and it's just very special to me,\" Trump said in the Facebook video. \"And again, I want to thank the evangelicals. I will never let you down.\"", "But that's still an open question for some evangelicals here. Seventeen-year-old David Blom said he went to a Trump event last week, in part, to try to get a better sense of the authenticity of his faith. ", "\"Just listening to the language from Trump tonight, he said 'terminated' instead of 'killed' when he was talking about life,\" said Blom, who has trained other students at his school to caucus (many, he said, are leaning toward Trump or Cruz). \"He makes fun of the media, but then he uses the pro-choice, and pro-abortion term instead of what an Iowa evangelical would see as being a person of life and value.\"", "\"Life is super important and we can't have a new convert leading the pro-life movement as the Republican nominee,\" the high school senior said.", "Surrogates for Cruz have traveled the state emphasizing Cruz's consistency on social issues like marriage, abortion and religious liberty.", "\"Ted Cruz is going to be the same today as he was yesterday, as he will be tomorrow,\" former Texas Gov.

If it's closer to 2008's 239,000, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is the likely victor.

", "Two counties where Sanders must run up a huge delegate advantage are Johnson, where the University of Iowa is located, and Story, the home of Iowa State University. ", "If he loses either -- or Clinton even comes particularly close -- Sanders won't win Iowa. ", "Polk County, the home of Des Moines and the state's most delegate-rich area, looks more like Clinton's territory: It's the state's largest urban area, and she has campaigned heavily both in its downtown and suburban regions. African-Americans and Latinos, small in number as they are in Iowa, could be the key to a Clinton victory.", "There's another candidate hoping for an expanded electorate: Donald Trump. ", "The Republican front-runner's appeal to disaffected conservatives -- and some independents and \"Reagan Democrats,\" too -- will be tested immediately. If he succeeds in drawing a huge turnout, it's a positive sign for Trump long past Iowa.", "Texas Sen. Ted Cruz needs to win -- and win with a sizeable margin -- in the 44 counties west of Des Moines, which are more rural and more socially conservative than much of the state. ", "The establishment-leaning portion of the state could be Polk County and its more heavily-populated neighbors like Story and Dallas.

", "That strategy might push him over the top and into first place. But it also means anything else is a bust -- and could leave him limping out of the Hawkeye State into New Hampshire, where Trump is also in the lead.", "Monday is also Trump's first time on the ballot. He has consistently boasted about his poll numbers while on the stump. How will he react should he lose, even if only by a couple of points?", "Then there's what Twitter users are calling #Marcomentum: The sense that Florida Sen. Marco Rubio is surging late. Polls show him consistently running third behind Trump and Cruz, and if he manages to come close to those two, it would be a boon among establishment Republicans who are still searching for a candidate with a real path to the nomination. ", "Early-state results won't just identify front-runners -- they'll winnow what's an especially packed field of contenders on the Republican side. ", "If former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and former Pennsylvania Sen.

The political establishment assumed he'd be a passing fad -- and that Republican voters would ultimately move on to more \"serious\" candidates. ", "None of that happened.

", "Many previous winners from Jimmy Carter to Rick Santorum pulled off their victories after going county to county, sometimes talking to groups of voters as small as a dozen, and inspiring their volunteers to make sure those people turn out on caucus night. Ted Cruz has followed that traditional model, even visiting Iowa's 99 counties (again) in the final days before the contest. ", "His aides boast that they have some 1,530 precinct captains in the 1,681 precincts across Iowa, as well as 12,000 volunteers fanned out across the state.

The other unknown factor is that many of Trump's supporters have never caucused before, so the campaign has a big task ahead in ensuring they turn out.", "And we can't underestimate the power of Trump's social media footprint. Some first-time caucus goers who attended his rallies this week told CNN they had already clicked on the link Trump tweeted for the \"caucus finder\" on his website, where supporters can enter their address and zip code to find their caucus. And Trump has been pounding the importance of boosting turnout. In Clinton, Iowa, on Saturday night, he told his supporters that even if they were on their deathbed, he expected them to turn out.  ", "Evangelicals are often viewed as the most important voting bloc in Iowa in the GOP caucuses, helping boost conservative candidates Rick Santorum and Mike Huckabee to victory in 2012 and 2008, respectively. ", "But this year, they are split between Trump and Cruz, and to a lesser extent Ben Carson and Marco Rubio. ", "To everyone's surprise, many ", " despite his three marriages, marital infidelities and his dramatic evolution on the issue of abortion. Many told CNN in interviews that they admired Cruz's principled and consistent stands on abortion, gay marriage and religious liberty, but simply believe that Trump would make a stronger president. ", "To assuage doubts about his faith during his final push, Trump has been campaigning with evangelical leader Jerry Falwell Jr., who has served as a critical character witness for Trump by praising his private generosity and stating that Trump reminds him of his father, famed televangelist Jerry Falwell. Though he's had some embarrassing gaffes when talking about faith -- quoting \"Two Corinthians\" at Liberty University, for example, Trump played up his faith in the final weekend. He went to church on Sunday with his wife. On Saturday, he released a Facebook video showing the Bible that his mother gave him and promising evangelicals that he would never let them down. ", "Cruz's allies have continued to try to raise doubts about the authenticity of Trump's faith. On Sunday afternoon, Cruz urged evangelicals to choose the candidate who they knew they could count on. \"This is your time to make the decision for the men and women of Iowa to say we can't get fooled again. The stakes are too high. We can't roll the dice.\" ", "Bernie Sanders mounted a fierce challenge to Hillary Clinton by drawing on key pieces from the Obama coalition: particularly young voters. Their enthusiasm for Sanders is undisputable as he has drawn enormous crowds at college campuses here in Iowa and across the country and continues to engage with them on social media. ", "But he faces one hurdle that Obama didn't have in the 2008 Iowa caucuses: the intersection of geography and the complex rules of the Democratic Caucus. In 2008, the caucuses occurred much earlier in the year on Jan. 3. That meant many Iowa students supporting Obama were dispersed across the state in different precincts because they were still at home on winter break. This year, they are back on campus. That could hurt Sanders because it means they are more concentrated in certain precincts, giving less geographic breadth to his support than Obama's. ", "The reason that's important is because the Democratic winner in Iowa won't be determined by the overall number of votes. The winner is determined by the number of 'delegate equivalents' marshaled by their supporters in each precinct caucus. It's complicated, but if Sanders' young supporters are concentrated in a certain precincts, he may end up with less state delegate equivalents -- and that could spell a win for Clinton. ", "Des Moines Register pollster Ann Selzer raised this issue earlier this month when she noted that Sanders has maintained wide leads over Clinton in the three counties that house Iowa State University, the University of Iowa and the University of Northern Iowa. She told the Register that while those counties make up a sizable amount of Sanders' supporter, they only account for 21% of likely caucus participants. So even if Sanders pulls off a big turnout, that caucus quirk could be a strike against him here.", "Candidates who campaign here every four years love to talk about the state's reputation for \"Iowa nice\" -- the phrase that comes from the polite, friendly Midwest tradition of Iowa's farmers and voters. ", "But this year on the GOP side, those voters seem most taken by a candidate who is known for his bullying taunts of other candidates, reporters and whoever is the target of his Twitter feed that day. ", "On Sunday, Trump got increasingly personal in his descriptions of his chief rival: calling Cruz \"a lying guy,\" \"a hated guy\" and \"terrible.\" ", "The Iowa Nice tradition seems at odds with the latest Des Moines Register poll, which told us that Trump has among the highest unfavorable ratings of any of the candidates running -- and yet he is at the top of the pack.

Before the Hawkeye State's hardy caucus-goers have their say, let's take a look at where things stand in the race for the presidency in Iowa and in New Hampshire -- the next state to get a turn in the primary spotlight.", "The contours of both parties' contests in Iowa have suggested a tight race in recent weeks, but the most recent polling of likely caucus-goers suggests trends that tilt in favor of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. ", "According to the most recent CNN Poll of Polls averages in Iowa, released today night, Trump continues to hold a lead over Ted Cruz, while recent polling of the Democratic race suggests Hillary Clinton now holds a slim 3-point edge over rival Bernie Sanders, a shift from a 1-point Sanders edge in a Poll of Polls released last month.", "The most eagerly awaited addition to the slate of Iowa polls, the final Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Poll, found Trump in the lead for the first time in that poll's trend line, and showed Clinton with a 3-point edge over Sanders.", "That poll also suggested that those Iowans likely to participate in the Democratic caucus would generally be happy with either Clinton or Sanders at the top of the Democratic ticket come November. Both merit deeply positive favorability ratings from the pool of likely participants, 81% had a favorable view of Clinton, 82% Sanders, and about 7 in 10 say they would be enthusiastic about either candidate should they become the party's nominee.", "On the Republican side, however, the Bloomberg/Register poll suggested a different story. Only about half had a positive impression of field-leader Trump, 65% had a positive take on Cruz, and less than half said they would enthusiastically back Trump should he become the party's nominee. Should Trump win the caucuses tonight, the nomination race's outcome seems to rest on whether an anti-Trump vote could coalesce around a single candidate.", "There is one common theme emerging in New Hampshire polling: Both sides appear to have a clear leader. Both Trump and Sanders have comfortable leads over their respective fields, but the results of Monday's caucuses could lead to a shake-up in what has seemed like a fairly stable contest.", "New CNN Poll of Polls averages in New Hampshire find Sanders well ahead of Clinton in the first primary state of the 2016 nomination race, 55% to 37%. Those figures are unchanged from the previous CNN Poll of Polls there, released Wednesday. On the Republican side, the new Poll of Polls finds Trump at 31%, Cruz 13%, Rubio 11%, Ohio Gov. John Kasich at 10%, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush at 8% and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie at 7%.", "Trump's lead in New Hampshire shows little sign of abating, but as in Iowa, recent polling there suggests a sizable chunk of the electorate has doubts about him as the party's standard bearer. The new CNN/WMUR Poll there, released Sunday night, found that among likely primary voters who consider themselves moderate or liberal, few have made up their minds about whom to support, and nearly half have ruled out the possibility of supporting Trump. Those two factors suggest a moderate candidate who posts a strong showing in Iowa could potentially gain support in New Hampshire from this less-committed moderate pool of voters, who typically make up nearly half of GOP primary voters there.", "New Hampshire voters frequently make up their minds in the final days of the contest -- according to exit polls there in 2012, 46% of Republican voters said they made their decision in the last few days, as did 38% of Democratic voters in 2008 - so the results in polls right now are by no means the final word on the race."], "article_highlights": [], "article_author": ["Jennifer Agiesta"]}

", "\"It has been a bit of a circus,\" he added.", "Faced with the Donald Trump Show, Cruz went with an old-school Iowa strategy: Visit early. Invest in retail. Organize pastors. Tend to homeschoolers. Win the two big nods. Get outside of Des Moines.", "Despite Trump's unconventional campaign, and attacks from the billionaire that included questioning Cruz's eligibility to be president due to his being born in Canada, unaligned operatives until the last moments here remained certain that the core of Iowa caucus politics had not changed, despite Trump's unconventional campaign. ", "\"Iowa has sent notice,\" Cruz said Monday night, \"that the Republican nominee of the next president of the United States will not be chosen by the media, will not be chosen by the Washington establishment, will not be chosen by the lobbyists but will be chosen by the most incredible powerful force, where all sovereignty resides in our nation, by we the people, the American people.\"", "Cruz's team, basking in victory, projected more confidence than ever before that a strong showing in New Hampshire was within reach. Spokesman Rick Tyler pointed to Cruz's cash on hand, lapping the field by a considerable margin, and said it would put Cruz in a far better position than Marco Rubio and others in the Granite State -- even as they conceded Rubio now entered with momentum.", "It was a victory set into motion two and a half years ago, when Cruz first touched down at the Des Moines Marriott -- only six months after he had been sworn into the Senate. ", "Cruz was known at the time for ideological purity -- not evangelical fervor -- but over the next few years, he would add to his Christian image, citing Scripture repeatedly in barns and convenience stores as he became more and more tailor-made for Iowa Republicans.", "On that first trip here in August 2013, he met with a network of influential Iowa pastors, the same group he returned to last Monday, just a week before clergymen like them would help decide his fate. And he built his own network of evangelical pastors, recruiting one chief in each county and integrating them into a state leadership team that dwarfed other candidates' in size. ", "For much of 2015, Cruz visited Iowa consistently, but not overwhelmingly. He thumbed his nose at GOP rivals who essentially moved to the state in search of lightning strike. But he invested in face time, lingering late on a baseball diamond the day of the gay marriage decision in June and at a high-profile evangelical forum in November on one particularly long Iowa day.", "And he deliberately and conscientiously identified, courted and landed the two major conservative endorsements behind past Iowa winners, Rep. Steve King and Family Leader president Bob Vander Plaats, who together have been a road show for Cruz during his visits here over the past two months. ", "Their endorsements coincided with Cruz's first major surge in Iowa surveys, culminating with Cruz taking the lead in a Des Moines Register poll in mid-December. With King, he had a provocative spokesperson and a validator in the intense boxing match with the ethanol lobby. With Vander Plaats, he had a networker who could stick around to win over the weary (\"It's not that we dislike Santorum,\" he told one voter on the way out the door Saturday.)", "Cruz, who had worked hard to tamper expectations, had inadvertently raised them.", "\"You see the poll?\" Jeff King, the congressman's son, who leads the Cruz super PAC operation here in Iowa, remembers saying to another group official then. \"We're going to have to do well in Iowa.\"", "Cruz's wager on Iowa stood in contrast to his closest rivals: Trump and Rubio, both of whom are expected to do better in New Hampshire than the Texas senator.", "\"When he started this thing, he was nowhere,\" said GOP pollster Frank Luntz, standing on a chair as an overflow Cruz crowd surrounded him in Ames. \"I would use this campaign to teach others how to run a race.\" ", "Monday morning, the Texan's campaign bus ambled to a basketball court in this Greene County town along the Raccoon River to pay heed to Iowa's most revered custom: the \"Full Grassley,\" or the pledge to visit all 99 counties, named for Sen. Chuck Grassley.", "\"Whatever campaign techniques were used by the campaign that has won, maybe this was the year for that,\" said Jeff Kaufmann, the state's GOP chair. \"But I don't think retail politics, building a political machine and doing all 99 counties is every going to be out of date in this state.\"", "Trump spent a total of two nights in Iowa hotels, jetting in and out on a private plane for a rally every few days. Rubio blanketed the state in television ads, seeing campaign events as not as efficient a use of time as a Fox News hit or a super PAC media buy. Cruz aides stress that they layered a serious data and paid media campaign onto the infrastructure, but the bedrock of Cruz's bid here was a strategy that was more timeworn than innovative.", "Visiting every corner of Iowa doesn't guarantee anything, however. Mick Huckabee and Rick Santorum, who won the 2008 and 2012 GOP caucuses, respectively, barnstormed the state and came away at the bottom of the pack. Huckabee dropped out before the night was over.", "\"It will say as much about the process as it does about the outcome,\" said Joseph McReynolds, a Cruz fundraiser and activist, as he observed his candidate work a tiny town two days before voting.", "Up to the final hours in Iowa, Cruz's team maintained a sense of serenity, believing that the outcome's fate was largely out of their hands. Their voters would turn out. The big question that would decide the race was whether Trump's would -- and that was not in the Cruz campaign's control. ", "There was considerable worry among Cruz allies and donors that their candidate made the same mistake that bedeviled previous Iowa losers: that he peaked too early. ", "Cruz began a slow rise in Iowa polls in mid-October, but by the time he topped them in early January, he had invited the scorn of as many as seven outside groups, and nearly every candidate, including Trump, who was raising scornful questions about Cruz's eligibility to be president.", "In addition to Trump's intense trolling and prodding in television interviews, Twitter and other free media, Cruz's campaign estimates that the senator was pummeled by $8 million in attack ads last month.", "And some allies and donors concede that those weeks -- rather than days -- on defense took its toll, including concerns pushed by the state's ethanol lobby, who led voters to badger Cruz at nearly every town hall in the homestretch of the Iowa campaign. Supporters differ on the number of points shaved by the ethanol offensive, but they admit it broke through.", "Some friends, in retrospect, say the campaign could have been more aggressive toward Trump and earlier. Yet most argue that avoiding Trump's scorn was the closest thing the campaign had to a masterstroke -- nearly every candidate who attacked Trump, of course, crashed.", "It was a calculation they never thought they'd have to make. Cruz's win involved a fair amount of luck: Many of the candidates once likely to be top rivals here -- whether it was Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker or Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky -- fizzled entirely. When asked in June about the candidate competing with him most prominently in the evangelical lane, Cruz pointed to a candidate who ended up flirting with invisibility and dropped out Monday night: Mike Huckabee. ", "In the final moments, an old threat reappeared: Rubio. Trump had pulled away in some early polls, and Rubio began to inch up in some public polls. Cruz's super PACs, both weary Rubio's rise but also seeing his supporters as soft, began to target him aggressively. The campaign reassigned all of its advertising in the final days to hold off Rubio, once a vanquished opponent, instead.", "John Thompson, an unaligned Iowa GOP central committee member, said Cruz undoubtedly faded in the final weeks here. But the fundamentals of Cruz's bid, he said, charted a new Iowa path.", "\"He took the best out of every textbook that's ever been written,\" Thompson said, \"and I think he made a new game.\""], "article_highlights": ["Ted Cruz won the Iowa caucuses, outpacing Donald Trump and Marco Rubio", "He laid the groundwork early, as far back as 2013"], "article_author": ["Theodore Schleifer"]}

After all, the state's discerning political activists can make or break campaigns painstakingly pieced together over years in a single night.", "So it's fitting that the caucuses -- caucuses, plural, not singular caucus -- impose some unusual burdens on voters. In the Iowa caucuses, unlike primaries countrywide, you can't just get away with pulling a lever in a curtained polling booth at any time of the day that's convenient.", "Instead, hardy Iowans must attend public meetings in school gyms, arts centers, churches, libraries, restaurants and even fire stations in 1,681 precincts to vote for a candidate. The process is much longer -- it can take several hours -- and more convoluted than a primary ballot. So we've provided a guide to understanding how the Iowa voting ritual works.", "Caucus meetings for Iowa Democrats and Republicans begin at 7 p.m. Central Time, or 8 p.m. for the East Coast. Anyone who shows up on time can take part. But don't be late. Once the doors close, there is no entry for stragglers.", "No.", "The GOP process is the simpler one. ", "Caucus meetings begin with the Pledge of Allegiance and then activists get straight to the main event -- selecting their presidential candidates in a binding vote.", "Each campaign gets the chance to have a representative make a final pitch to any wavering voters before a secret ballot. Some caucus sites might use a printed ballot paper. Others just go with a candidate's name on a scrap of paper. ", "Raw totals of votes are tallied by local party officials and sent to Iowa GOP headquarters, where a running count is kept.", "The Democratic caucus system is a little more intricate.", "As soon as the meetings open, attendees must declare a preference for a candidate.", "Typically, backers of each presidential hopeful physically stake out positions around the room. People who still can't make up their mind join a group known as \"uncommitted.\"", "This is where it gets complicated. In order to be considered \"viable,\" a group must clear a certain threshold -- usually around 15% of the entire caucus turnout in each precinct.", "Once first-round votes are tallied, anyone stuck in a group that is not \"viable\" has the chance to align with a candidate who has passed the threshold.", "This year it's likely that supporters of Martin O' Malley, scraping along at low single-digits in the polls, will struggle at many caucus meetings to form a \"viable\" coalition.", "The former Maryland governor thinks differently, saying at a CNN town hall Monday night that \"my message to the O'Malley supporters across this state is this: Hold strong at your caucus.\"", "But it's one of the cruel realities of the caucuses that if the O'Malley pack is too small, all the determination in the world won't be enough, and his supporters will have to decide whether to join backers of either former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton or Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders during a second count -- known as a \"re-alignment period.\" ", "No. A controversial aspect of the Democratic caucuses is the lack of a secret ballot.", "That means people will have to live with the vote they cast in front of their friends and neighbors for the next four years. And the faint of heart may be susceptible to pressure from more vociferous contemporaries.", "Thus, a candidate who wins the first round of a caucus is not home safe. They can still end up losing if their supporters fail to win over backers of candidates eliminated for not passing the threshold and instead see that support go elsewhere -- one reason why the organization and training of precinct captains is so crucial for campaigns.", "It's also why the second choices of voters for a presidential candidate are so important in the Democratic caucuses.", "Once the final count is completed, local officials work out how many delegates from a precinct each candidate gets to send the local county convention, the next step in a process that will end at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia in July.", "For some voters, it's all too much trouble. ", "So the actual electorate in the caucuses is only a fraction of the tallies of registered Democrats and Republicans who will vote in the fall. That's one reason why you often hear complaints that the caucuses are hardly the most democratic process -- especially given the state's disproportionate influence on the presidential race.", "Generally, caucus participation has been around 20% of registered voters in each party in recent election cycles.", "In 2004, for example, there were half a million registered Democrats in Iowa, but only 124,000 or so showed up on caucus night, according to the Iowa Caucus Project at Drake University.", "In 2012, there were 614,000 registered Hawkeye Republicans but only 121,000 made it out on caucus night.", "The exception to the rule was in 2008 during the electrifying race between Clinton and then-Illinois Sen. Barack Obama -- who made good on a vow to turn out new voters. ", "A stunning 239,872 Democrats flocked to take part  -- a figure equivalent to nearly 40% of the party's registered voters. ", "Both Republican real estate developer Donald Trump and Sanders dream of such a showing on Monday night.", "The Vermont senator, however, warned Tuesday that he'd probably not match the Obama surge.", "\"Frankly, I don't think we can. What Obama did in 2008 is extraordinary,\" Sanders said.", "Another wrinkle that angers critics is the way independents are shut out: Only registered Democrats or Republicans can take part. ", "In theory, people who have not previously registered to vote can arrive at a caucus site and do so. And it is possible to switch party affiliation on the night. But the system is still criticized for keeping out more moderate voters and often leads to a perception that only the most committed, radical voters show up.", "There were frequent veiled whispers from the Clinton campaign in 2008 that the system unfairly helped Obama, who ran to the former New York senator's left.", "Clinton was still simmering in 2012 when she told her friend Sidney Blumenthal in a recently released email that the caucuses were \"creatures of the parties' extremes.\"", "The final tabulated results will be declared by the Democratic and Republican Parties. It could all be wrapped up between about 11 p.m. ET and midnight. But soon after the caucus doors close, it should be possible for CNN to report on where the race is heading and begin the process of projecting a winner and estimating the delegate count.", "Iowa officials will be hoping that there will no repeat of the debacle in 2012. On that night, Mitt Romney was declared the winner by only eight votes over former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, who is running again this year. But a certified tally issued a few weeks later found Santorum had won by 34 votes. ", "By then it was too late: Santorum had been deprived of the momentum an Iowa caucus win brings. Romney was on a roll and had won New Hampshire, en route to the GOP nomination.", "The elevated level of commitment demanded of caucus-goers is one reason why the vote is so tough to forecast -- no one can tell exactly who is going to show up.", "This time around, for instance, the hopes of Sanders and Trump rely on their neophyte political operations turning out thousands of new voters who have never attended caucus meetings in the past.", "The turnout riddle could give early pointers as to how things will go on Monday night.", "If there are early reports of Iowans flocking to caucus sites in unusually high numbers, there's a good chance it will be a happy night for Sanders and Trump. If not, look for Clinton and Texas Sen.

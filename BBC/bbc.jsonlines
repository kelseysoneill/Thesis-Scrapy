he called it a \"heresy\" - the notion the United States is not just unique but superior has long been an article of national faith. </p>", "<p>Writing in Democracy in America, which set out to explain why the American Revolution had succeeded while the French Revolution had failed, Alexis de Tocqueville observed Americans were \"quite exceptional\", by which he meant different rather than better. </p>", "<p>Over the centuries, however, the idea has taken hold here that America is liberty's staunchest defender, democracy's greatest exemplar and home to the usually brave - a country like no other.</p>", "<p>That America has emerged as the leader of the free world is not regarded as some cosmic fluke. </p>", "<p>Its global role and mission, a responsibility to spread American values around the world, was divinely sanctified and historically preordained, thanks to the genius of its founding fathers. </p>", "<p>Jefferson's \"empire of liberty\", Roosevelt's \"arsenal of democracy\", and Reagan's \"shining city upon a hill\" are variants on the same theme of American pre-eminence, a country that sought to colonise the planet with its ideas. </p>", "<p>Early in his presidency, Barack Obama looked set to retire the rhetoric of exceptionalism, even though many in America and around the world regarded his election, after the shocks of 9/11 and the Great Recession, as proof of its salience. </p>", "<p>\"I believe in American exceptionalism,\" <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o_YW4Oaehg\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">he told a journalist in 2009 during a visit to Strasbourg</a>, \"just as I suspect that the Brits believe in British exceptionalism and the Greeks believe in Greek exceptionalism.\" </p>", "<p>Now, though, his speeches are essays in exceptionalist thinking, even if qualified with reminders about the constraints of US power and his personal preference for multilateral co-operation. </p>", "<p>The problem, globally, is that American exceptionalism has increasingly come to have negative connotations. </p>", "<p>The hitch, domestically, is that Americans seem to be losing faith in the American system and American dream, hence the rise of populists like Bernie Sanders on the left and Donald Trump on the right. </p>", "<p>Consider the face that America has recently presented to the rest of the world. </p>", "<p>The frontrunner in the race for the Republican nomination has called for almost a quarter of the world's population to be <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-35035190\" class=\"story-body__link\">barred temporarily from entering the country</a>, a nativist cry that has boosted Donald Trump's popularity. </p>", "<p>America's Grand Old Party has been in a state of open civil war. </p>", "<p>The idea of a Clinton restoration has failed to generate much enthusiasm - to many it smacks of a country going backward not forward, despite its promise of a female first. </p>", "<p>The campaign, rather than being a beacon of democracy, has often been a viral joke.</p>", "<p>Then, look beyond the campaign trail. </p>", "<p>Flint, Michigan, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-35376517\" class=\"story-body__link\">a city poisoned by its drinking water</a>, is a story one would ordinarily expect to cover in the developing world in a failed state. </p>", "<p>The Netflix global sensation Making a Murderer has put the US criminal justice system in the dock.</p>", "<p>The Oregon militia stand-off has echoes of the lawless Wild West. </p>", "<p>Before the monster blizzard closed much of the north-eastern US, Washington was brought to a standstill by an inch of snow. </p>", "<p>Days later, the federal government remained shut down.</p>", "<p>The Big Short, a movie about the collapse of the subprime mortgage market and the avarice of the major US investment banks, is a reminder of the excesses of Wall Street, and the fact just one person was prosecuted following the 2008 financial collapse. </p>", "<p>Even Hollywood's great shop window, the Academy Awards, has been mired in controversy over its <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-35350418\" class=\"story-body__link\">\"whites-only\" nominations</a>. </p>", "<p>American exceptionalism itself has something of a Sunset Boulevard feel to it, a black comedy where a faded silent movie star believes she is still the most luminous presence on the screen.</p>", "<p>Nor is this merely a recent phenomenon.</p>", "<p>In the run-up to the Iraq war, American exceptionalism smacked of imperial hubris.</p>", "<p>In the chaotic aftermath, it was more a case of decline and fall. </p>", "<p>The National Security Agency scandal has undercut America's claim to have a clarion voice in international diplomacy. </p>", "<p>Post-9/11, the detention centre at Guantanamo Bay has become as much a symbol of America to many in the world as the Statue of Liberty. </p>", "<p>After the massacre of schoolchildren in Newtown, and the epidemic of mass shootings elsewhere, American exceptionalism came to be equated with unchecked gun violence.</p>", "<p>Ferguson, and a spate of other police shootings of unarmed black men, has raised questions about the fairness of policing, a problem that seems especially pronounced here. </p>", "<p>America also has the world's highest incarceration rate, with 4.4% of the global population but 22% of its prisoners. </p>", "<p>Putting so many people behind bars again seems uniquely American.</p>", "<p>Even Nasa's space programme no longer engenders the same worldwide awe as it did in its early days, when planting the Stars and Strips in the Sea of Tranquillity offered proof of exceptionalism, even as American GIs were mired in the quagmire of Vietnam.</p>", "<p>Many of the problems are systemic, arising from flaws in the democratic model that was supposed to offer a prototype. </p>", "<p>Much of the gridlock in Washington stems from checks and balances that have come to be used as partisan weapons. </p>", "<p>The constitution, an extraordinary document reflecting the brilliance of its authors, looks, to many, out of date. </p>", "<p>In this age of mass shootings, laws are still based on a document drafted in the era of the single-shot musket. </p>", "<p>The oddities of Campaign 2016 stem, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/the-reporters-35365848\" class=\"story-body__link\">as I argued last month</a>, partly from the quirks and oddities of the electoral process.</p>", "<p>As for spreading American values around the world, many people here simply don't think it is worth the expenditure of blood and treasure, especially after draining wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. </p>", "<p>Wanting America to be great again, the slogan of Donald Trump that often sparks chants of \"USA, USA, USA\", is not the same as embracing exceptionalism, an implicitly interventionist creed. </p>", "<p>The mood is more Fortress America, a bunker mentality. </p>", "<p>Besides, there have always been Americans, especially on the left, who roll their eyes at the mere mention of exceptionalism. </p>", "<p>For them it sounds arrogant, bullying, embarrassing. </p>", "<p>Plainly, America can still boast pre-eminence in many realms. </p>", "<p>It is militarily, culturally and financially dominant. </p>", "<p>Impressive still are its powerhouse universities, its tech hubs and elite hospitals. </p>", "<p>However, just as striking are the symbols of regression: its decrepit schools, creaking bridges and antique airports.</p>", "<p>Travelling around the country, perhaps the most striking difference from when I lived in America 10 years ago is the lack of national self-belief - a sureness, a braggadocio, that gave American exceptionalism real resonance at home. </p>", "<p>With middle-class incomes stagnant, and with so much wealth concentrated in the hands of the much-derided \"One Per Cent\", the American dream just no longer seems to ring true for many families. </p>", "<p>Certainly, it is harder these days to find parents who believe, with absolute conviction, their children will enjoy lives of greater abundance. </p>", "<p>Once, that truth was held to be self-evident.</p>", "<p>To many American readers, I know, this will all reek of the kind of European condescension that has doubled as commentary since the founding days of the Republic - Americans are not the only people with a sense of their superiority. </p>", "<p>All I would say is I write as a long-time admirer: someone who at various stages of my life - as a schoolboy, as a student here, and as a young correspondent - has acted out my own version of the American Dream, at times with unblinking eyes. </p>", "<p>While still seductive, while still thrilling, these days, I find the United States harder, as an outsider, to love.  </p>", "<p>For these are times when \"Only in America\" is increasingly used as a term of derision, and \"American exceptionalism\" sounds like an empty boast.</p>"], "article_author": ["Nick Bryant"]}

Yet Mr Bush won because he got 271 electoral votes compared with 266 for Mr Gore. </p>", "<p class=\"story-body__answer\">The winning votes came from Florida, whose 25 votes all went to Mr Bush even though he won only 537 more popular votes.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body__answer\">Another drawback is that in many states the result is a foregone conclusion and there is thus little incentive for the individual to vote. It is also a disincentive for candidates to campaign there.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body__answer\">For example, large states California, Illinois and New York are solidly Democratic and Texas is solidly Republican.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body__question\"><strong class=\"story-body__question-text\">So what are the advantages?</strong></p>", "<p class=\"story-body__answer\">The electoral college system is respected for its historical roots and because it does usually reflect the popular vote (48 out of 52 elections since 1804 produced a popular mandate). </p>", "<p class=\"story-body__answer\">It also gives greater weight to smaller states - one of the checks and balances the US constitution values.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body__answer\">For example, the largest state, California, has 12.03% of the US population but its 55 electoral college votes represent only 10.22% of the college total. </p>", "<p class=\"story-body__answer\">Wyoming, a sparsely populated state, has 0.18% of the US population but its three seats in the electoral college give it 0.56% of the college votes.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body__answer\">The college system also means that a candidate needs to get a spread of votes from across the country.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body__question\"><strong class=\"story-body__question-text\">What happens if no candidate gets a majority of electoral college votes?</strong></p>", "<p class=\"story-body__answer\"><a href=\"http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxii\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">Under the 12th amendment to the US constitution</a>, the House of Representatives elects the president.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body__answer\">Each state delegation, however, has only one vote, which means that the majority party in each delegation controls the vote. An absolute majority of states is required for election.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body__answer\">The vice-president is chosen by the Senate, with senators having an individual vote.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body__answer\">This has happened only once since 1804, when the electoral college system took its current shape with the 12th amendment.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body__answer\">In 1824, four candidates split the electoral vote, denying any one of them a majority.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body__answer\">Democrat Andrew Jackson had the most electoral votes and the greatest share of popular votes and expected to be president. </p>", "<p class=\"story-body__answer\">But the fourth-place finisher, House Speaker Henry Clay, thought little of Jackson and persuaded the House to back second-place finisher John Quincy Adams. Adams was voted in as president.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body__question\"><strong class=\"story-body__question-text\">Are the electors bound to vote for their candidates?</strong></p>", "<p class=\"story-body__answer\">In some states they have a free vote but in practice they vote for the candidates they are pledged to, while in other states they are required to do so. </p>", "<p class=\"story-body__answer\">Only nine electoral votes have been cast against the state's instructions by so-called \"faithless\" electors, and no result has been changed by it, according to the Congressional Research Service. And in 2000 an elector from the District of Columbia abstained.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body__answer\">If the result is extremely close, a \"faithless\" elector could cause real trouble. The issue would probably have to be decided by the courts.</p>", "<p class=\"story-body__answer\">The electors are chosen by the parties before the election, often in a vote at a convention. The electors then meet in state capitals after the election to cast their votes. The results are formally declared to the Senate on 6 January. The new president is inaugurated on 20 January.</p>"], "article_author": []}

He wants to </strong>build a \"great, great wall\" between the US and Mexico. In some of his earliest campaign comments, Trump suggested that Mexicans coming to the US are largely criminals. \"They are bringing drugs, and bringing crime, and they're rapists,\" <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/16/donald-trump-mexico-presidential-speech-latino-hispanic\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">he said</a>.

He also believes that Mexico should have to pay for the wall, which a BBC analysis estimates could cost between <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-34275564\" class=\"story-body__link\">$2.2bn and $13bn</a>.</p>", "<p><strong>8</strong><strong>. A mass deportation </strong>of the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants living in the US should go into effect. Despite criticism that this idea is both xenophobic and prohibitively expensive - the BBC estimates $114bn - Trump says his deportation plan is as <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-34789502\" class=\"story-body__link\">achievable as it will be humane</a>. In addition, his immigration reforms would end <a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/images/uploads/Immigration-Reform-Trump.pdf\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">\"birthright citizenship\"</a>, the policy that grants the children of illegal immigrants citizenship so long as they are born on American soil. He does not support creating a new path to citizenship for undocumented workers. </p>", "<p><strong>9</strong><strong>. He and Vladmir Putin</strong> would \"get along very well\". <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2015/10/11/politics/donald-trump-vladimir-putin-2016/\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">In an interview</a> with CNN, Trump said that Putin and Obama dislike one another too much to negotiate, but that \"I would probably get along with him very well. And I don't think you'd be having the kind of problems that you're having right now\".</p>", "<p><strong>10</strong><strong>. In order to </strong>end mass shootings, the US should<a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/positions/second-amendment-rights\" class=\"story-body__link-external\"> invest in mental health</a> treatment. However, Trump does not believe that more gun control is the answer. In a position paper on gun rights, Trump revealed he has a concealed carry permit and that when it comes to gun and magazine bans, \"the government has no business dictating what types of firearms good, honest people are allowed to own\". He would also oppose an expansion of background checks.</p>", "<p><strong>11</strong><strong>. China should be </strong>taken to task on <a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/positions/us-china-trade-reform\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">a number of issues</a> in order to make trade with the US more equitable. If elected he says he will make China stop undervaluing its currency, and force it to step up its environmental and labour standards. He is also critical of the county's lax attitude towards American intellectual property and hacking. </p>", "<p><strong>1</strong><strong>2</strong><strong>. The Black Lives </strong>Matter movement is \"trouble\". Trump mocks Democratic candidates like Martin O'Malley for apologising to members of the protest movement against police brutality and casts himself as <a href=\"http://dailycaller.com/2015/08/03/trump-we-have-to-give-power-back-to-the-police-video/\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">a pro-law enforcement</a> candidate. \"I think they're looking for trouble,\" he once said <a href=\"http://uk.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-black-lives-matter-2015-9?r=US&amp;IR=T\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">of the activist group</a>. He also tweeted a controversial graphic purporting to show that African Americans kill whites and blacks at a far higher rates than whites or police officers. However, the graphic cites a fictitious \"Crime Statistics Bureau\" for its numbers, and has been widely debunked using real FBI data.</p>", "<p><strong>1</strong><strong>3</strong><strong>. Current unemployment statistics </strong>are wrong. Trump has said repeatedly that unemployment in the US is at 20% - once commenting it may be <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/dandiamond/2015/08/06/donald-trump-claims-obama-is-lying-about-unemployment-heres-what-the-data-say/\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">as high as 42%</a> - despite the fact that the Bureau of Labor Statistics pegs the number at 5.1%. Trump says he doesn't believe that figure is real. </p>", "<p><strong>1</strong><strong>4</strong><strong>. His net worth </strong>is $10bn. Based on Trump's 92-page personal financial disclosure form, <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-07-28/here-s-our-tally-of-donald-trump-s-wealth\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">Bloomberg calculated</a> that the real estate mogul is worth about $2.9bn and <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/erincarlyle/2015/07/15/donald-trump-says-he-is-worth-10-billion-files-personal-financial-disclosure/\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">Forbes put</a> Trump's worth at $4bn.

Veteran healthcare</strong> in the US needs a major overhaul. Trump wants to clear out the executive level in the Department of Veterans Affairs, saying that wait times for doctor visits have only increased after previous interventions failed. Thousands of veterans have died while waiting for care, he says. He will invest in the treatment of <a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/positions/veterans-administration-reforms\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">\"invisible wounds\"</a> like post-traumatic stress disorder and depression.

The world would </strong>be better off if Saddam Hussein and Muammar Gaddhafi were still in power.

He says that the Paris attacks prove that even a handful of terrorists posing as migrants could do catastrophic damage, and so he will oppose resettling any Syrians in the US, and deport those who have already been placed here.</p>", "<p><strong>20. Kim Davis should </strong>get another job. The Kentucky clerk became a conservative cause when she was jailed for refusing to issue marriage licences to gay couples because of her Christian faith. But Trump said: \"I'm a very, very strong believer in Christianity and religion, but I will say that this was not the right job for her.\"</p>", "<p><strong>21.

He seemed grumpy, fed up, irritated, irascible and old. Last night watching the debate, I suddenly got it, I really got it. </p>", "<p>Here is a man who speaks politics from the gut. He calls it as he sees it, and there seems to be no filters in what he says. If he has got an idea, he'll express it with clarity. </p>", "<p>While other politicians might have sounded rehearsed when taking about Hillary Clinton's \"damn emails\", Sanders sounded genuinely sick of the subject.  </p>", "<p>He is way to the left of anything else you'd find in American politics. He wants to bring in healthcare like you have in Europe and social security systems that the United States does not have at the moment. He wants environmental politics that would be an anathema to many in the oil industry. He kept talking about Scandinavia as if he wants to import Scandinavia wholesale. It is like going into IKEA and saying \"I'll buy the whole store\".</p>", "<p>Of course the United States is not Scandinavia. But that won't bother the legions of young people who have been attracted to this brand of honest politics where there are no concerns about whether it makes you electable or unelectable. He seems to have a magic that makes people believe anything is possible. </p>", "<p>Clinton has the reverse problem. You feel that everything she says has gone through 30 filters to get out any germs or creases or wrinkles along the way to make it sanitised so that it will stand up to scrutiny. </p>", "<p>She's a brilliant debater, but you didn't feel the sense of excitement about her policies as you would about Bernie Sanders. Why is that?</p>", "<p>I suspect the thing about Sanders is that he knows that he's setting up policies that will never have to be implemented. Deep down, he and his backers know that he isn't going to win the nomination or keys to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.</p>", "<p>Clinton has to have policies that could be put in place the moment she gets to the White House. And so it's careful. It isn't taking you away believing there is a new Jerusalem to be built on the Hill.</p>", "<p>Clinton knows that policy changes incrementally and sometimes torturously. That is what she offered in the debate last night. </p>", "<p>Intelligent and battle-hardened, she has the policy details down. She knows what it takes to implement policy. But those policies aren't going to make voters believe that a new dawn is being born for America.</p>", "<p>In French politics, which I covered for a long time when I was the BBC's Paris correspondent, the presidency is held over two rounds - the first round of voting two weeks before the final round. </p>", "<p>It is said in French politics that in the first round you vote with your heart and in the second round you vote with your head.</p>", "<p>Well in the equivalent situation of US politics, it seems that in Sanders you're voting with your heart and in Clinton you're voting with your head. </p>", "<p>Clinton had a good night last night and she was absolutely on top of every detail.  She was funny, passionate and did everything her campaign could have hoped for. All of which makes me wonder if there's little room now for Vice-President Joe Biden in this race.</p>", "<p>Biden's calculation is probably based on the fact that Clinton's poll ratings will continue to slide, her backers will continue to have doubts and the base will continue to grow more disenchanted.</p>", "<p>I suspect that Clinton did enough to stem that decline last night and maybe, just maybe, she's a step closer to that nomination.</p>"], "article_author": ["Jon Sopel"]}

His mother raised him and his siblings after their father left the family when Carson was 8. He credits his mother, Sonya, with prioritizing his education even after he struggled with his grades. </p>", "<p>Carson eventually went to Yale, where he <a href=\"http://www.baltimoresun.com/entertainment/bal-bs-bs-ae-proposalson20110211163306-photo.html\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">met his wife</a> Candy.

In 2009, it became the basis for a movie on the television network TNT in which Carson was <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1295085/\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">played by Cuba Gooding Jr. </a></p>", "<p>He also spent much of his time speaking to classrooms of young students in Baltimore. </p>", "<p>\"I can't even count how many times I saw Ben Carson when I was a kid,\" writer Ta-Nehisi Coates once told to<a href=\"http://www.gq.com/story/ben-carson-tea-party\" class=\"story-body__link-external\"> GQ magazine</a>, \"Any time anyone wanted to bring out any sort of inspirational figure for young black kids, especially young black boys, in Baltimore, you turned to Ben Carson.\"</p>", "<p>The books also lay out Carson's strong religious convictions. He was raised a Seventh Day Adventist and these religious beliefs also inform many of his political views.</p>", "<p><strong>Political aspirations</strong></p>", "<p>Carson began drifting toward politics with the publication of his 2012 book, America the Beautiful: Rediscovering What Made This Nation Great, which was critical of the election of Barack Obama. He then rose to fame in the conservative political arena after giving a speech at a 2013 National Prayer Breakfast that was unexpectedly critical of Obama's health care plan. </p>", "<p>The president was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFb6NU1giRA\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">sitting just two chairs away,</a> and Carson was exuberantly lauded for his gall by Rush Limbaugh and Sarah Palin.

He has credited the draft movement as a major reason he jumped into politics.</p>", "<p><strong>Conservative and controversial views</strong></p>", "<p>Though his affect may differ from Trump's, Carson also has a history of controversial statements which have landed him in hot water. </p>", "<p>While he concedes that gay marriage is now <a href=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/ben-carson-gay-marriage-decision\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">\"the law of the land,\"</a> at one point he told an interviewer that marriage should be between a man and a woman, and that \"no group, be they gays, be they Nambla, be they people who believe in bestiality, it doesn't matter what they are, they don't get to change the definition\".

I believe that President Obama has led this nation from crisis to recovery, and we're now on the cusp of resurgence. I'm proud to have played a part in that. This party, our nation, will be making a tragic mistake if we walk away or attempt to undo the Obama legacy. The American people have worked too hard, and we have have come too far for that. Democrats should not only defend this record and protect this record. They should run on the record.\" </p>", "<p>Let's put that through the politico-translator app. What comes out? <i>Hillary, if you want me to back you don't go around trash-talking the president's record.

And I think we can. It's mean spirited, it's petty, and it's gone on for much too long. I don't believe, like some do, that it's naive to talk to Republicans. I don't think we should look at Republicans as our enemies. They are our opposition.\"</p>", "<p>Translation?<i> Clinton- enough already with the 'Republicans are our enemies'</i><i>. </i><i>If you win you're going to have to govern with them, so stop being so </i><i>bloody </i><i>divisive</i><i>.</i> (I think this must be an app from the UK).</p>", "<p>And then I put this final phrase in:</p>", "<p>\"I am absolutely certain that we fully are capable of accomplishing extraordinary things. We can do this.

Given the troubled and maladroit way the email saga has been handled that can't be entirely ruled out. </p>", "<p>And if something did go horribly wrong with Clinton's campaign - wouldn't the Democratic Party turn to the vice-president in its moment of need, saying: \"Come on Joe\".</p>", "<p>And he would say \"You bet\".

But that's exactly how the pugnacious non-politician likes it.</p>", "<p><strong>Best moment:</strong> He insists he's not \"braggadocious\" (see his would-be Secret Service codename below), but even Donald Trump must have been pleased with the series of early one-liners he used to put down his rivals. After Rand Paul accused him of junior high insults: \"I never attacked him on his look - and believe me there's plenty of subject matter\". And when Jeb Bush sparred with him over money from donors: \"More energy tonight - I like that\".</p>", "<p><strong>Biggest flop:</strong> But The Donald had no answer to Carly Fiorina. He was uncharacteristically muted when she challenged him on his grasp of foreign policy and blushed when she delivered a Trump-esque putdown over his comments on her appearance. His awkward response - \"she has a beautiful face and is a beautiful woman\" - did not help. </p>", "<p><strong>Secret Service codename:</strong> Humble</p>", "<p><strong>Final verdict:</strong> Bruised but certainly not beaten. And the usual political rules don't seem to apply so we'll have to wait until the next polls come out. </p>", "<p>Promoted to the prime-time showdown after her much-heralded performance during last month's undercard debate, the former head of computing giant Hewlett-Packard didn't disappoint. </p>", "<p>She showed a firm command of the issues, which she effectively mixed with personal touches. While citing her daughter, who died of drug addiction, during a question on marijuana legalisation could have seemed forced, her answer came across as sincere. And her response on government funding of Planned Parenthood - \"This is about the character of our nation. If we will not stand up and force President Obama to veto this bill, shame on us!\" - was an emotional peak.</p>", "<p><strong>Best moment: </strong>It was a question she surely prepared for, but it was expertly handled nonetheless. When she was asked about Donald Trump's attempted explanations for his comment that he couldn't envision \"that face\" of hers as president, she tartly replied: \"I think women all over this country heard very clearly what Mr Trump said.\" The audience roared.</p>", "<p><strong>Biggest flop</strong>: As expected Ms Fioriana had to defend her record as head of HP, a post from which she was forced to resign in 2005 after laying off 30,000 workers. Her explanation - that it was in the middle of a massive tech sector collapse - was serviceable, but it led to a more challenging give-and-take on business acumen with Trump.</p>", "<p><strong>Secret Service codename: </strong>Secretariat (the Triple Crown-winning <a href=\"http://www.secretariat.com/\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">racehorse</a>)</p>", "<p><strong>Final verdict: </strong>She proved she belonged on the big stage. And could she prove to be Trump's kryptonite?</p>", "<p>It was a higher-energy Jeb Bush that took the stage in Wednesday's debate, once even giving Mr Trump an emphatic low-five after a joke about his Secret Service codename. </p>", "<p>The structural challenges the candidate faces, however, were unchanged, and he still stumbles when trying to address them. There's the famous last name, of course, but beyond that is the awkwardness he shows whenever he tries to pivot during an answer to his record as Florida governor. Those days were more than a decade ago, which is an eternity in politics. </p>", "<p><strong>Best moment: </strong>Mr Bush closed out the debate with talk of his plan to grow the economy at 4%. While many critics say it's a pie-in-the-sky promise, there wasn't much discussion of the economy during the debate, despite Republican voters saying it's their top concern. If people were still paying attention after nearly three hours of debate, they may have liked what they heard.</p>", "<p><strong>Biggest flop: </strong>Jeb Bush began an answer about federal funding for Planned Parenthood with a reference to \"Title 10 of the HHS funding bill\". He said more after that, but chances are his audience had stopped paying attention. </p>", "<p><strong>Secret Service codename: </strong>Eveready (after the battery)</p>", "<p><strong>Final </strong><strong>v</strong><strong>erdict: </strong>Higher energy isn't likely to lead to better results - at least for now.</p>", "<p>The retired pediatric neurosurgeon gave another low-key debate performance on Wednesday night. Given that his last bit of prime-time somnambulance kicked off his recent rise in the polls, more of the same may be a winning ticket for the man. His line about immigration and how US farmers are hiring immigrants to do the jobs Americans don't want to do would normally be radioactive for a Republican candidate, but it'll probably just slide off Mr Carson's back.</p>", "<p><strong>Best moment:</strong> It was Mr Carson's closing statement in the first debate that won him the highest praise, and his final statement was again one of his high points. \"I see a lot of people trying to divide us,\" he said. \"Real leadership is what I would hopefully bring to America.\"</p>", "<p><strong>Biggest flop:</strong> The highly decorated doctor could have torn into Mr Trump for advancing the view that there might be a link between vaccinations and autism despite all evidence to the contrary. Instead he was his normally restrained self, calling the New Yorker an \"OK doctor\", before adding that there is \"extremely well documented proof that there's no autism link to vaccinations\".</p>", "<p><strong>Secret Service codename: </strong>One Nation (also the title of his autobiography)</p>", "<p><strong>Final </strong><strong>v</strong><strong>erdict: </strong>Another dose of slow and steady may be just what the doctor ordered.</p>", "<p>The Florida senator offered a crisp, polished performance from start to finish without getting bogged down in back-and-forth sniping with any of the other candidates, including the always irascible Trump. Although his sponsorship of immigration reform in the Senate is an area of weakness for him with much of the Republican electorate, he adeptly turned questions on the topic into talk of his compelling personal story as the child of poor Cuban exiles.</p>", "<p><strong>Best moment:</strong> Mr Rubio had the opportunity to answer a foreign policy question directly after Mr Trump, and the contrast couldn't have been sharper. Where the billionaire spoke in vague platitudes, Mr Rubio was specific and precise, ranging from North Korea to Russia to China to the Mid-East.</p>", "<p><strong>Biggest flop: </strong>Mr Rubio has missed more votes in Congress than any other other senator, which Mr Trump hit him on at one point. It's a testament to Mr Rubio's rhetorical skill that he was able to perform a bit of political jujitsu and turn it into a condemnation of a legislative body that's \"out of touch with the American people\". Will the American people buy it? In this anti-establishment political environment, they just might. </p>", "<p><strong>Secret Service codename:</strong> Gator (he went to the University of Florida)</p>", "<p><strong>Final </strong><strong>v</strong><strong>erdict: </strong>If Mr Rubio finally breaks out of the Republican pack, he can credit two solid debate performances.</p>", "<p>It wasn't a bad debate performance by the Wisconsin governor, but given his precipitous decline in the polls he needed much, much more. He had limited chances to answer questions, and much of the ground he did cover was on foreign policy, which isn't his strong suit.  </p>", "<p><strong>Best moment: </strong>Early in the debate, Mr Walker took his shot at Mr Trump: \"We don't need an apprentice in the White House - we have one right now.\" Yes, it was obviously a well rehearsed line - and it mischaracterised Mr Trump's role on his reality show - but at least it was a memorable quip in an otherwise forgettable performance.</p>", "<p><strong>Biggest flop:</strong> When Mr Walker was asked about his presidential qualifications, he cited dealing with the 100,000 activists who demonstrated by the Wisconsin state capitol during a showdown over government union dues in 2011.  It may remind people a little too much of his most prominent gaffe, when he said earlier this year that his handling of those protesters helped prepare him to confront Islamic militants.</p>", "<p><strong>Secret Service codename: </strong>Harley (he loves to ride the motorcycles)</p>", "<p><strong>Final </strong><strong>v</strong><strong>erdict: </strong>Mr Walker's campaign sinking in quicksand and tonight's debate wasn't the lifeline he needs.</p>", "<p>It may be a case of what-might-have-been for Mr Christie. His performance on Wednesday was virtuoso, but it might have come one debate too late for the New Jersey governor. He's sunk so low in the polls that even a win here may not be enough to jump-start his campaign. Time will tell.</p>", "<p><strong>Best moment:</strong> Mr Trump and Ms Fiorina were engaged in a nasty back-and-forth about their business acumen when Mr Christie jumped in with the kill shot: \"For the 55-year-old construction worker out in that audience tonight, who doesn't have a job, who can't fund his child's education, I've got to tell you the truth, they could care less about your careers, they care about theirs,\" he said. \"Let's start talking about that on this stage and stop playing games.\"</p>", "<p><strong>Biggest flop:</strong> In a campaign that's been dominated by non-politicians like Mr Trump and Mr Carson, the New Jersey governor tried to play up his anti-establishment credentials. \"I am a Republican in New Jersey,\" he said. \"I wake up every morning as an outsider.\" It was a nice try, but I don't think anyone is going to buy that.</p>", "<p><strong>Secret Service codename: </strong>True Heart (a Kirsten Dunst adventure movie and this <a href=\"http://carebears.wikia.com/wiki/True_Heart_Bear\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">Care Bear</a> both share that name)</p>", "<p><strong>Final Verdict:</strong> Chris Christie got his groove back.</p>", "<p>It was another disappearing act for the Kentucky senator. He was provided limited time to answer questions, and he didn't do much with the opportunities he did have. When the talk turned to the Iran deal, Mr Paul was one of the few who didn't amp up the anti-Iran rhetoric. He said it was \"absurd\" to promise to cut up the deal without seeing if Iran was complying.

On Iran he said he would work with allies, rather than rip up the deal, but re-impose sanctions and take military action if necessary. And he warned Republicans that calls to shut down the government in protest at money given to the family planning group could backfire. It's something he knows all about, since he was a Newt Gingrich lieutenant in Congress during the shutdown fights of the 1990s.</p>", "<p><strong>Biggest flop: </strong>Given a chance to slam Hillary Clinton - an open goal in front of this audience - he said he'd prefer to use the time to introduce himself, and his achievements, to a wider audience.

Now, as then, American elections commonly witness the triumph of fear over hope. </p>", "<p>As we enter election year, there is a deep pool of nervousness and resentment from which to draw. </p>", "<p>On the economic front, there is the shrinkage of the American middle class. <a href=\"http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2015/12/09/the-american-middle-class-is-losing-ground/\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">New figures from Pew Research</a> suggest that for the first time in more than four decades, the middle class is no longer in the majority. </p>", "<p>People becoming wealthy enough to be defined as \"better off\" explain some of this shrinkage. But 20% of Americans are now in the lowest income tier, compared with 16% in the early 1970s.</p>", "<p>The median wealth of middle-class households has also seen a dramatic fall over the course of this century, decreasing by 28% from 2001 to 2013. Pew found also that median incomes in all wealth brackets were lower in 2014 than in 2000. The \"American dream\" is not such an animating force.</p>", "<p>What's often called the Uberisation of the economy - the move towards freelancing and flexible working arrangements - is eroding the traditional compact between employer and employee.</p>", "<p>Fears about economic security overlap with fears about national security. </p>", "<p>In the aftermath of the San Bernardino and Paris attacks, Americans are more fearful about the prospect of terrorist attacks than at any time since 9/11, according to a poll conducted by <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/11/us/politics/fear-of-terrorism-lifts-donald-trump-in-new-york-times-cbs-poll.html\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">the New York Times and CBS News</a>. </p>", "<p>Some 44% of the public thought an attack was \"very\" likely in the next few months. <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/187655/americans-name-terrorism-no-problem.aspx\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">A poll this month from Gallup</a> suggested that Americans regard terrorism as the country's number one problem.</p>", "<p>Confidence in American institutions has also been on the wane, <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/1597/confidence-institutions.aspx\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">as seen in another Gallup poll.</a> Here are the results for how many people said they had a \"great deal of confidence\" in the following:</p>", "<p>These are not good days for the American establishment, whose pillars look increasingly wobbly.</p>", "<p>Beyond these statistics lies further evidence of national anxiety. </p>", "<p>The spate of mass shootings - <a href=\"http://www.shootingtracker.com/wiki/Mass_Shootings_in_2015\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">almost one a day in 2015</a> - has not just spread fears about public safety, but seemingly heightened concerns among gun owners that the federal government will some day restrict the availability of firearms (not that gun control is going anywhere in Congress). </p>", "<p>That offers one explanation for the <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/12/01/gun-sales-black-friday/\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">spike in gun sales on Black Friday</a> in November, when the FBI ran a record-breaking 185,345 background checks, about two per second. </p>", "<p>The Black Lives Matter campaign continues to highlight the brutal excesses of certain police officers. In recent months, a number of leading American university campuses, including Yale, have been restless. Even American football, the national winter sport, seems to be in a perpetual state of scandal.</p>", "<p>Add to that the unchecked rise of China, the difficulty in combating the group calling itself Islamic State, the inability to humble Vladimir Putin, the failure to defeat the Taliban and a nagging sense of the waning of American international influence and that pool of resentment increasingly resembles a toxic swamp. </p>", "<p>The state of the union is perturbed and anxious. America is beset by a climate of uncertainty and fear in which populist campaigns, like those mounted by Donald Trump on the right and Bernie Sanders on the left, can flourish. </p>", "<p>Worryingly for Hillary Clinton, periods of national anxiety also have a tendency of producing party change in the White House.

His mother raised him and his siblings after their father left the family when Carson was 8. He credits his mother, Sonya, with prioritizing his education even after he struggled with his grades. </p>", "<p>Carson eventually went to Yale, where he <a href=\"http://www.baltimoresun.com/entertainment/bal-bs-bs-ae-proposalson20110211163306-photo.html\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">met his wife</a> Candy.

He was raised a Seventh Day Adventist and these religious beliefs also inform many of his political views.</p>", "<p><strong>Political aspirations</strong></p>", "<p>Carson began drifting toward politics with the publication of his 2012 book, America the Beautiful: Rediscovering What Made This Nation Great, which was critical of the election of Barack Obama. He then rose to fame in the conservative political arena after giving a speech at a 2013 National Prayer Breakfast that was unexpectedly critical of Obama's health care plan. </p>", "<p>The president was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFb6NU1giRA\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">sitting just two chairs away,</a> and Carson was exuberantly lauded for his gall by Rush Limbaugh and Sarah Palin.

He has credited the draft movement as a major reason he jumped into politics.</p>", "<p><strong>Conservative and controversial views</strong></p>", "<p>Though his affect may differ from Trump's, Carson also has a history of controversial statements which have landed him in hot water. </p>", "<p>While he concedes that gay marriage is now <a href=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/ben-carson-gay-marriage-decision\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">\"the law of the land,\"</a> at one point he told an interviewer that marriage should be between a man and a woman, and that \"no group, be they gays, be they Nambla, be they people who believe in bestiality, it doesn't matter what they are, they don't get to change the definition\".

He calls it as he sees it, and there seems to be no filters in what he says. If he has got an idea, he'll express it with clarity. </p>", "<p>While other politicians might have sounded rehearsed when taking about Hillary Clinton's \"damn emails\", Sanders sounded genuinely sick of the subject.  </p>", "<p>He is way to the left of anything else you'd find in American politics. He wants to bring in healthcare like you have in Europe and social security systems that the United States does not have at the moment. He wants environmental politics that would be an anathema to many in the oil industry. He kept talking about Scandinavia as if he wants to import Scandinavia wholesale.

Why is that?</p>", "<p>I suspect the thing about Sanders is that he knows that he's setting up policies that will never have to be implemented. Deep down, he and his backers know that he isn't going to win the nomination or keys to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.</p>", "<p>Clinton has to have policies that could be put in place the moment she gets to the White House.

That is what she offered in the debate last night. </p>", "<p>Intelligent and battle-hardened, she has the policy details down. She knows what it takes to implement policy. But those policies aren't going to make voters believe that a new dawn is being born for America.</p>", "<p>In French politics, which I covered for a long time when I was the BBC's Paris correspondent, the presidency is held over two rounds - the first round of voting two weeks before the final round. </p>", "<p>It is said in French politics that in the first round you vote with your heart and in the second round you vote with your head.</p>", "<p>Well in the equivalent situation of US politics, it seems that in Sanders you're voting with your heart and in Clinton you're voting with your head. </p>", "<p>Clinton had a good night last night and she was absolutely on top of every detail.  She was funny, passionate and did everything her campaign could have hoped for. All of which makes me wonder if there's little room now for Vice-President Joe Biden in this race.</p>", "<p>Biden's calculation is probably based on the fact that Clinton's poll ratings will continue to slide, her backers will continue to have doubts and the base will continue to grow more disenchanted.</p>", "<p>I suspect that Clinton did enough to stem that decline last night and maybe, just maybe, she's a step closer to that nomination.</p>"], "article_author": ["Jon Sopel"]}

Santorum and Huckabee, both former Iowa Caucus winners, have failed to recapture that old magic on the campaign trail. They've put all their eggs in a good showing in Iowa, and at this point that's just not going to happen.</p>", "<p><i>How one of them wins:</i> A giant meteor strikes the site of next Republican candidate debate.</p>", "<p><i>How they lose:</i> Already taken care of, thanks.</p>", "<p><strong>Carly Fiorina</strong></p>", "<p>Fiorina's moment, when she shot to the top of opinion polls following a bravura performance in the second Republican debate, seems like a long time ago. In the four months since then, her fortunes have steadily diminished, as she's struggled to stay in the headlines. Fiorina has spent roughly equal time in Iowa and New Hampshire, and unless she stages a late comeback in either place, she likely won't last long after that.</p>", "<p><i>How she wins</i>: A strong showing in one of the two debates before Iowa gives her a bump that actually has staying power.</p>", "<p><i>How she loses</i>: Ignominious defeats in Iowa and New Hampshire lead to an early return to the lecture circuit. </p>", "<p><strong>Rand Paul</strong></p>", "<p>Once upon a time, Paul was considered a top-tier candidate. Negligible standing in early state opinion polls, however, have left his campaign stuck in also-ran status. Even a heralded debate performance last month in Las Vegas appears to have done little to reverse his fortunes.</p>", "<p><i>How he wins:</i> The college-age libertarians and disaffected Republicans who fuelled his father's insurgent campaigns in 2008 and 2012 take a break from tweeting Star Wars spoilers and show up in Iowa and New Hampshire in large numbers, allowing him time to build the non-traditional Republican coalition he envisioned when he launched his campaign.</p>", "<p><i>How he loses:</i> His father's supporters opt for Ayn Rand book club meetings instead of heading to the polls, and traditional Republican voters continue to snub him.</p>", "<p><strong>Ben Carson</strong></p>", "<p>The retired neurosurgeon still has reasonably strong poll numbers, but his trajectory has been heading straight down. Political fallout from the Paris attacks - and the subsequent renewed focus on strong leadership skills and foreign policy acumen - have left the sedate candidate in a tenuous position. A mass exodus of top staff just before New Year gave further support to the view that the Carson campaign is a sinking ship.</p>", "<p><i>How he wins:</i> Evangelicals in Iowa who fuelled his rise return to the fold, leading a top-two finish there and renewed interest in his candidacy.</p>", "<p><i>How he loses: </i>The nosedive continues, and like grains of wheat through a pyramid, so go the days of Carson's campaign.</p>", "<p><strong>Jeb Bush</strong></p>", "<p>He's got the money, but will he ever find the love? Although the former Florida governor is looking a bit more solid on the campaign trail, it may be too little, too late at this point. New Hampshire saved his father's campaign in 1988, and it may be Jeb's last hope. While he has the infrastructure to battle on after that, establishment and moderate Republicans will likely have found another candidate to rally behind by then.</p>", "<p><i>How he wins: </i>A strong showing in New Hampshire keeps his head above water, allowing his greater financial resources to come into play as the campaign grinds on for months.</p>", "<p><i>How he loses:</i> He's a non-factor in Iowa, and he finishes behind his establishment competitors in New Hampshire. His father's old advisers take him aside and gently explain that it's time to find another life goal.</p>", "<p><strong>John Kasich</strong></p>", "<p>The Ohio governor has put all his eggs in the New Hampshire basket, but after a surge there early in the autumn he's now polling roughly at parity with all the establishment candidates in the high single digits. If he can break through and beat Bush, Marco Rubio and Chris Christie, he could make a move. If not, it's likely curtains for the governor.</p>", "<p><i>How he wins:</i> A top-two finish in New Hampshire helps anoint him as the sensible man to beat Cruz or Trump.</p>", "<p><i>How he loses: </i>New Hampshire proves to be his Waterloo.</p>", "<p><strong>Chris Christie</strong></p>", "<p>The New Jersey governor is in a similar position to Kasich, pinning his hopes on New Hampshire, but his outlook is slightly better because he's been steadily improving his numbers while the Ohio governor has stagnated. He also has surprising institutional support in Iowa, including the backing of key aides to Governor Terry Branstad. That hasn't translated into any momentum yet, but Christie has started spending more time in the Hawkeye State.</p>", "<p><i>How he wins:</i> A solid third-place finish in either Iowa or New Hampshire will give his campaign life.</p>", "<p><i>How he loses:</i> Blowout losses in the first two contests or an inability to translate successes there into more national appeal sends him back to New Jersey. </p>", "<p><strong>Marco Rubio</strong></p>", "<p>With consistently strong debate performances and a slow-but-steady approach to campaigning, many expected Marco Rubio to emerge as the man to challenge Trump and the other anti-establishment outsiders. That just hasn't happened yet. He's well behind Trump and Cruz in Iowa and mired in a slugfest with the other mainstream candidates in New Hampshire. His super PAC recently launched a negative ad blitz against Christie, which is a surprising demonstration of concern about a candidate he should be easily outperforming by now. </p>", "<p><i>How he wins:</i> A strong showing in Iowa or New Hampshire solidifies the support for traditional Republican voters and allows him to persevere until Florida and more moderate states give him wins in mid-March and thereafter.</p>", "<p><i>How he loses:</i> He's yet to make a move in any state - and maybe he never does. He ends up the candidate everyone sort-of likes but nobody votes for.</p>", "<p><strong>Ted Cruz</strong></p>", "<p>The Texas senator finds himself in an enviable position. If Trump fades, he inherits the New Yorker's disaffected supporters. If Trump endures, he could become the only viable alternative to a panicked Republican establishment. Not bad for a candidate the New York Times derided as having a slim to no chance of winning when he entered the race in March.</p>", "<p><strong>How he wins:</strong> As is now expected he is victorious in Iowa, allowing to him to survive a loss in New Hampshire. Then he racks up win after win in the Southern primaries that follow. By the time an establishment candidate emerges to challenge him, he has an insurmountable lead.</p>", "<p><strong>How he loses: </strong>A surprise defeat in Iowa will kill his momentum. Trump could become an unstoppable juggernaut after winning New Hampshire, or an establishment candidate emerges there who consolidates support, while Cruz and Trump divide outsider votes.</p>", "<p><strong>Donald Trump</strong></p>", "<p>It's January, and Trump is still going strong. While he's been eclipsed by Cruz in Iowa, New Hampshire looks good for the billionaire. He's drawing huge crowds at rallies across the country, including in South Carolina and other key states in the South. Now he's spending millions on television advertising. The man is in this for the long haul.</p>", "<p><strong>How he wins:</strong> Beating Cruz in Iowa would be a significant boost. Otherwise, he holds onto New Hampshire, wins in South Carolina and steamrolls into the Southern primaries in March. Clint Eastwood nods approvingly as Trump delivers the first-ever ad-libbed acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention.</p>", "<p><strong>How he loses:</strong> Trump supporters, many new to the political process, never find their way to the voting booth. He suffers a resounding defeat in Iowa, damaging his self-styled proven-winner identity. Either he loses New Hampshire, which seals his fate, or he wins, but the party establishment rallies around a candidate to stop him. He delivers an epic withdrawal speech that insults every Republican candidate, Rosie O'Donnell, Samuel L Jackson, anyone who didn't vote for him and the entire population of Mexico.</p>", "<p><strong>Republican candidates in, and out, of the 2016 presidential race</strong></p>"], "article_author": ["Anthony Zurcher"]}

When he plunged into the crowd, flanked by his newly acquired Secret Service escort, the multitude pressed against him, seeking autographs and selfies.</p>", "<p>\"People say he doesn't have experience, but he has a lot more experience than Marco Rubio or Ted Cruz because he has executive experience,\" says Nicholas Poucher, a 16-year-old supporter from Lakeland, Florida. \"He has experience running a billion dollar company, and that's the business that counts - not just sitting in a Senate seat.\"</p>", "<p>One supporter placed a hand on Mr Trump's face as he passed - a strange, loving gesture that the New Yorker, who is reluctant to even shake hands, surely found off-putting. </p>", "<p>It's all part of life on the presidential campaign circuit, however.

They want somebody that's not connected with the government. They don't trust government anymore.\"</p>", "<p>Mr Carson, the other outsider candidate who has benefitted the most from this mistrust of government, took the stage shortly after Mr Trump departed - and the contrast between the two men couldn't have been more stark.</p>", "<p>Where Mr Trump was bombastic, Mr Carson was demure. Where the billionaire mogul was boastful, the retired neurosurgeon was humble.</p>", "<p>\"The good thing about God,\" he told the crowd, \"is you don't have to have a PhD to talk to him. You just have to have faith.\"</p>", "<p>In his quiet manner, however, he was equally scornful of the current Democratic government. </p>", "<p>He offered a litany of ways progressives are bringing the nation down - driving up debt, allowing illegal immigration, pushing people onto food stamps, promising free education, reducing funding for national defence, ignoring crumbling public infrastructure and neglecting veterans affairs.</p>", "<p>\"That's what I would do if I were trying to destroy the country,\" he said.</p>", "<p>After his speech Mr Carson was asked if he was angered by Mr Trump's recent attacks.</p>", "<p>\"When I was a youngster, I used to get irritated by that kind of thing - 'he said this about you, he said this about your momma',\" he said. \"I've moved so far beyond that, I don't pay attention to that kind of stuff.\"</p>", "<p>He added, however, that his quiet manner shouldn't be taken as a sign of weakness.</p>", "<p>\"Strength is not determined by the number of decibels in your voice,\" he said.</p>", "<p>Although Mr Carson doesn't display Mr Trump's fire on the campaign trail, his supporters are equally dedicated.</p>", "<p>\"He has a lot of good virtuous qualities that I'm looking for in a candidate,\" says Amy Handshoe of Winchester, Kentucky. \"I feel like he has a fresh vision and a fresh approach to the problems.\"</p>", "<p>Angela Nuzzi, a student at the nearby University of Central Florida, says she admires Mr Carson's willingness to persevere in the face of Mr Trump's criticism.</p>", "<p>\"His whole demeanour is so different than Trump's,\" she says. \"I think the soft-spokenness brings you in, and you just see he has all these ideas that are just genius.\"</p>", "<p>Earlier in the day Mr Carson's business manager said that his candidate admired Mr Trump and was praying for him - a sentiment that several Carson backers echoed later in the day.</p>", "<p>\"We like Donald Trump, but you can't pull back from that [criticism of Carson],\" says Annie Otto, a Wildwood, Florida, resident who has organised the group Grannies for Carson. </p>", "<p>\"I'm disappointed, but I do believe in the American people's common sense.\" </p>"], "article_author": ["Anthony Zurcher"]}

And he's done so with a brand of anti-immigration, anti-Muslim rhetoric that is flying in the face of a plan the Republican Party set out nearly four years ago to take back the White House in 2016.</p>", "<p>Shortly after Mitt Romney's loss to Barack Obama in November 2012, Republican strategists reviewed the election returns and the growing US ethnic diversity <a href=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/6-big-takeaways-from-the-rnc-s-incredible-2012-autopsy\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">and surmised</a> that they had to broaden their party's appeal. </p>", "<p>\"By the year 2050 we'll be a majority-minority country and in both 2008 and 2012 President Obama won a combined 80% of the votes of all minority groups,\" Republican Party head Reince Priebus said, adding that his party \"cannot and will not write off any demographic or community or region of this country\".</p>", "<p>With Mr Trump's latest rhetorical flourish, however, Republicans can likely \"write off\" the support of Muslim US citizens. And his ongoing diatribes against immigration from Latin America aren't going to win the hearts of Hispanics, either. Even if he doesn't capture the nomination, he's pulled his party to the anti-immigrant, nativist right and forced his fellow candidates to take positions that could be harmful when the general election comes around next November.</p>", "<p>In perhaps the greatest irony, Mr Trump is waging his war with the Republican establishment and the US media with tools that the conservative movement fashioned  and had previously used with gusto. </p>", "<p>During his campaign rallies, he often says 70% of journalists are \"really dishonest\" - capitalising on the distrust of the mainstream media that has been sown by Republican politicians for decades.</p>", "<p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-31120958\" class=\"story-body__link\">Meet all of the 2016 hopefuls</a></p>", "<p>Mr Trump also echoes the traditional conservative condemnations of the federal government in Washington, DC, as a bloated, wasteful institution populated by career politicians who are, intentionally or not, bringing harm to the nation. But he takes those lines and uses them as a blunderbuss against everyone in power, Republicans included. </p>", "<p>It's a phenomenon seen on a smaller scale in 2010 and 2012, when numerous establishment-sanctioned Republican Senate candidates were defeated in the primary process by grass-roots-backed candidates who were then skewered by their Democratic counterparts in the general election. That dynamic is now playing out on the presidential stage, </p>", "<p>Politicians of all stripes, conservatives and liberals, are corrupted by power, Mr Trump said at a rally in Northern Virginia last Thursday. </p>", "<p>\"They win their election, and they go to Washington, and they're with their wife or husband, and they say: 'Look at the beautiful columns. I don't want to leave this place, this is so beautiful.' And they let us down.\"</p>", "<p>He went on to demean and dismiss one after another of his Republican opponents. Jeb Bush, John Kasich, Marco Rubio, even also-ran George Pataki and former candidate Rick Perry got swiped.</p>", "<p>According to conservative commentator Brian Cates, Mr Trump's remarks reveal that he doesn't want to take over the Republican Party, he wants to burn it to the ground from the inside - and his supporters are just fine with that.</p>", "<p>\"The people endlessly pushing for Trump, they're not doing it because they want a stronger, more conservative GOP,\" Cates <a href=\"https://twitter.com/drawandstrike/status/673811606812229632\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">tweets</a>. \"They want to destroy the GOP.\"</p>", "<p>Trump supporters are done with traditional politicians, who they feel have turned their back on their campaign promises to bring a conservative revolution to Washington. \"They are venting their anger at a political party that consistently let them down and betrayed them,\" he writes.</p>", "<p>Ask Trump supporters why they stand by their man, however, and you'll get a slightly different story.

Could the average American stomach those images, with all their attendant historical echoes?</p>", "<p>The majority of US citizens - especially Hispanics, younger Americans and Democrats - support a path to either citizenship or permanent residency for undocumented immigrants. </p>", "<p>Under plans first put forward by President Obama in 2014, about five million undocumented immigrants would be allowed to apply for work permits and eventually permanent residency. </p>", "<p>Most of those eligible are undocumented parents whose children were born in the US and so are US citizens.</p>", "<p>But Mr Obama's plan was initially rejected by Congress.

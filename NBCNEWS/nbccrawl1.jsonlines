", " Cruz's campaign blasted out a report Monday night that suggested Carson was going home to Florida instead of campaigning after the Iowa caucuses - something Cruz said Tuesday is \"fair game\" - but admitted that the campaign should have corrected that report when it became clear Carson wasn't dropping out of the race. He was just going home to get \"fresh clothes.\" ", " \"This was a mistake from our end, and for that I apologize to Dr. Carson,\" Cruz said in a statement Tuesday, hours after he was declared the winner in Iowa while Carson finished a distant fourth.

", " \"If Ted Cruz doesn't know about this, then he clearly needs to very quickly get rid of some people in his organization,\" ", " Tuesday morning. \"And if he does know about it, isn't this the exact kind of thing that the American people are tired of? Why would we want to continue that kind of, you know, shenanigans?\" ", " Carson's wife, Candy, visited two caucus locations to speak in support of her husband but had to first tell voters he was still in the race. She told MSNBC in an exclusive interview that she was frustrated and upset. ", " \"It wasn't fair to us, it wasn't fair to Iowans, and it also wasn't fair to the other candidates. Who knows how many of those votes might have gone to them?\" Mrs. Carson said. \"It's just totally tainted.\" ", " She - and the campaign - have argued the tactics are a sign of \"dirty business\" in Iowa. ", " \"That's politics,\" Mrs. Carson said, and then argued that \"that's not the American way, that's not what our founding fathers envisioned.\" ", " Iowans from across the state confirmed the story to MSNBC last night, and many of them felt the entire situation was inappropriate. ", " \"I was shocked - I'm a Huckabee supporter and I'm shocked. Why is a Cruz supporter standing up their talking about Dr. Ben Carson?\" home school activist Barb Heki asked MSNBC on Monday night. \"It's none of their business.\" ", " ", " "]}

", " On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton's campaign may have eked out a victory, but the razor-thin finish suggests she has a long way to go before she can safely say she's made the sale to progressive voters. And the polling was all wrong for Republicans, with Sen. Ted Cruz triumphing over front-runner Donald Trump and a hard-charging Sen. Marco Rubio. ", " An unusually chastened Trump said he was \"honored\" to come in second, but privately the candidate, who has spent much of his time in the spotlight slamming his rivals and trumpeting his own position in the polls, must be stewing over the fact that Loser.com now redirects to his Wikipedia page. ", " Here are a few more takeaways from Monday night's results: ", " What a difference a day makes. Just 48 hours ago, Donald Trump appeared to be running away with the Republican nomination. Polls showed him surging into first in Iowa, and with formidable leads in the upcoming primary states of New Hampshire and South Carolina, he looked poised for a clean sweep. His second place finish has now raised serious doubts about his ground game and his presumed invincibility. The good news for Trump is that New Hampshire voters are infamous for rejecting the whims of Iowans. Trump has a substantial lead there and if he pulls out a victory he could be very much in play in the states that follow. But now his challenge is figuring out who he needs to slap down more: Cruz, or Rubio. ", " The surprisingly close third place showing of the Florida senator certainly seemed to suggest that he may have solidified the establishment Republican vote going forward. Rubio's concession speech sounded a lot more like a call to arms, setting up the showdown with Cruz that pundits have been predicting from months. Perhaps most telling, Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina endorsed Rubio following the caucus results Tuesday morning, and several more high-profile GOP stars may align behind him soon, too. But it won't all be smooth sailing for Rubio. Bush, Kasich and Christie are all jockeying for the same constituency in New Hampshire, and Cruz has far more money in the bank. ", " Cruz was the winner last night, but you'd hardly know it based on today's reactions. While his organization in Iowa won the day, the campaign took some serious hits on its way to the finish line, and there is no question that Trump and Rubio were nipping at his heels. Questions of likability and electability will continue to dog Cruz as he enters New Hampshire, which is less dominated by the kind of evangelical social conservatives that were his base in Iowa. Still, he has significant funds and solid standing in several of the upcoming primary contests. ", " Besides bolting Iowa to get some new clothes, the former top-tier neurosurgeon's role in this race will be crucial in the weeks ahead. Although he has fallen considerably in the polls, his share of the vote may hamper the ambitions of Cruz and Trump. His campaign's claims that Cruz sabotaged them in Iowa could have some traction going forward, especially if they feed into the narrative that the Texas senator is a \"nasty guy.\" Carson's rocky performances as of late and perpetual campaign turmoil spell trouble, but he shows no signs of letting up just yet. ", " Hillary Clinton once had a 50-point lead in Iowa, so by any measure the Bernie Sanders finish should be alarming to the former secretary of state and her supporters. Clinton was supposed to be better organized and better positioned in Iowa, but the Vermont senator's enthusiastic supporters clearly made her ground game a wash. Next up is New Hampshire, which is even friendlier territory for Sanders - right now, he enjoys a double-digit lead there. Even though the map starts looking more favorable to Clinton after next week, she will likely want to make a race of it with Sanders in New Hampshire to avoid the narrative that her candidacy is imploding. ", " Despite his strong showing in Iowa, Sanders is not necessarily tapping into the broader Obama coalition, which propelled the president to victory in 2008 and 2012. He still needs to make a more effective case to black voters and less ideologically purist Democratic voters in the races ahead. According to the Bloomberg Politics/Des Moines Register poll, 43 percent of Democratic voters in Iowa identify as \"socialist,\" and New Hampshire, as a neighbor to Vermont, is essentially a hometown contest. The question remains whether Sanders' radical agenda has legs past these first two contests. ", " The righteous indignation of the both the right and the left carried the day on Monday. The overwhelming majority of Republican caucus-goers expressed a dissatisfaction with the direction of the federal government, which is a little ironic considering the fact that the GOP currently controls the House and the Senate. Their anger was reflected in the one-two finish of Cruz and Trump, arguably the two most anti-establishment candidates running. The photo-finish race between Clinton and Sanders (historically, one of the narrowest margins ever, although in 2012 Santorum beat Romney by just 34 votes) could also be interpreted as a thumb in the eye of politics as usual, too. Sanders' unconventional campaign (all small donations, no overtly negative advertising) paid off, at least in the short term. ", " Democrat Martin O'Malley and Republican Mike Huckabee are the only casualties (so far) of the contest in Iowa. Despite some very poor showings, candidates like Jeb Bush, Rick Santorum, Carly Fiorina and yes, Jim Gilmore, aren't about to drop out, which could shape the races to come. Super PAC money appears to be propping up longshot contenders like Rand Paul, and the dissatisfaction with the current front-runners, particularly Cruz, could give several also-ran candidates a reason to stick around, which could only prolong the nomination process. ", " After candidates spent several weeks canvassing all over Iowa (in Cruz's case, visiting all 99 counties), it's already yesterday's news. All of the major candidates, except for the Republican Iowa winner, will be making appearances in New Hampshire on Tuesday. It's still unclear what resources Cruz will devote to the state, but the fact that his first pit stop after Iowa is South Carolina could speak volumes. Meanwhile, Trump will try to regain momentum at a campaign rally later this evening in Milford, N.H. Will the new, more subdued Trump show up? That remains to be seen. "]}

", " All week, his campaign meticulously managed expectations, juggling the conflicting demands of setting expectations and projecting strength on the campaign trail. Throughout the weekend, advisers and Rubio himself refused to predict anything beyond third place, insisting Cruz's formidable ground game still had him in line for first place, and Rubio was aiming for third. ", " \"We have some wind at our backs right now and that's great,\" Rubio adviser Todd Harris told NBC News over the weekend, \"but at the same time we're competing with the greatest showman on earth on the one hand and arguably the greatest ground game in Iowa political history on the other. ", " \"We still feel very good about things, but the reality is, that what we're hoping to do is exactly what we've been shooting for for the last couple of months, which is a strong third place finish.\" ", " So when Rubio finished the night just one point behind Donald Trump and five behind winner Ted Cruz, with 23 percent support \u2014 a number that far outpaced polls of the state, which had him in the mid-teens, on average \u2014 it was viewed as a remarkable and unexpected feat that shattered all expectations set for the candidate this week. ", " On the stump, Rubio was meticulous in managing his message, playing up his faith for much of the week \u2014 including during the debate, when he told the crowd that Jesus Christ was \"the only Lord and Savior\" \u2014 but returning to a more secular-minded focus on the Constitution and his vision for a \"New American Century\" this past weekend. ", " And he positioned himself both as a hopeful, positive candidate, but one who shares voters' anger with the status quo. He also isn't afraid to hit back at an attacking opponent. ", " On the stump on Sunday, Rubio dismissed attacks from his opponents as \"fine\" and pivoted back to his pitch as the one candidate that can beat Democrats Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders next November. But on national and local television, he railed against Cruz for what he called a \"misleading\" attack ad and \"disturbing\" mailer, cutting a starkly different profile from the one on the campaign stage. ", " The pivot back to a more hopeful message on the stump in the final weekend, coupled with a week of positive coverage for the surging candidate, seemed to help clinch him much of his support. Rubio led by 5 points with the 35 percent of voters who decided within the last few days, according to exit polling. ", " Exit polling also showed that his electability pitch resonated \u2014 he held a 20-point lead among the 21 percent of voters who said that picking the candidate who \"can win in November\" was most important to them. ", " And he was able to match Trump's support among Evangelicals, which made up 62 percent of the electorate, while he only narrowly trailed him with all other religions, which made up 38 percent of the electorate. ", " Rubio's strategy of dropping in and out of the state for visits only in the campaign's targeted counties \u2014 which drew criticism early on for seeming piecemeal \u2014 helped him drive out bigger-than-expected turnout in some of his key counties, particularly the suburbs of Des Moines. Where Rubio was once ridiculed as the \"Mayor of Ankeny\" for spending so much time in the suburban Des Moines area, he ultimately eked out a win over Cruz in that county by just 500 votes, making it one of a handful of counties where Rubio pulled ahead by just a few hundred votes. ", " It was a good night for Rubio \u2014 his advisers crowed that the GOP presidential primary had now become a \"three-man race\" and argued the finish boosted Rubio's main pitch to voters: That he's the only viable alternative to Cruz and Trump. ", " \"If you don't want Ted Cruz or Donald Trump as the nominee, you better get on board with Marco Rubio,\" Rubio Communications Director Alex Conant said on MSNBC. ", " And strategists for multiple opposing campaigns acknowledged privately on Monday night that they were surprised at Rubio's strength in Iowa, and none would offer a decisive line of attack that could seriously blunt his momentum him with any confidence.

There's plenty of inevitable twists and turns in store between now and Election Day in 2016. ", " Consider what has happened so far that few would have guessed: The entrance of nearly two dozen candidates into the race, almost half a dozen have already dropped out (including one-time frontrunner Scott Walker), one highly anticipated campaign never come to be (Joe Biden), and the rise of a reality television star and a pediatric neurosurgeon. ", " But there are some take-it-to-the-bank parts of a presidential campaign, including the process of a presidential cycle. Here's a viewers guide to help understand the rhythms of campaign 2016: ", " ", " ", " The fall before an election year is a critical time for presidential campaigns. Most of the candidates have been on the trail in Iowa and New Hampshire for months at this point and have spent countless hours raising money and hashing out the issues. Now it's time to use all that preparation as more voters begin to tune into the race. ", " So the fall is busy with candidates visiting early nominating states, participating in debates, raising money, retooling strategy and staff and fulfilling requirements to appear on state ballots - all critical components to building a successful and long-lasting campaign. It doesn't seem different from their summer days but the stakes are growing ever higher. ", " The polls begin to roll in and each one is given more weight than the last. Some candidates are already out of the race while others fight to remain relevant. Move forward or get lost in the shuffle, it's the winnowing season for the field. ", " ", " ", " February 1st is the first nominating contest. It takes place in Iowa and that's why the candidates spend so much time there, appealing to the active members of the party to spend an Iowa winter night to support candidates of choice. The caucuses aren't as easy as pushing a button on a voting machine. It's a process where you stand in a room with as many as several hundred of your neighbors and coral in the corner designated for your candidate. ", " The onus on the campaign is to not only campaign in the state but to teach Iowans how to caucus for them. And the candidate with the most loyal - and largest - following do the best. ", " After Iowa is the New Hampshire primary on February 10. Also known as the First In The Nation primary, it's a coveted position to Granite State voters who relish their ability to influence the race. What about Iowa you ask? Technically First In The Nation is an accurate term because while Iowans caucus, New Hampshire voters head to the voting booth: an actual primary. ", " After the first two states, the Democratic and Republican calendars diverge. Democrats in Nevada hold their caucuses on Saturday February, 20th while South Carolina Republican voters head to the polls on that same day. ", " Then Republicans turn their attention to Nevada on February 20th and Democratic focus goes next to South Carolina for a primary on February 27th. ", " By February 27th the first four states will have weighed in for both Republicans and Democrats. ", " Then March is a busy month with caucuses or primaries every Tuesday and half of the Saturday. By the end of the month voters in nearly 30 states will have had their say. ", " ", " ", " In many presidential years, the nominee is usually decided by the time 30 states vote. To achieve the nomination, candidates have to win a majority of delegates. Most delegates are awarded to candidates who win the primary or caucus in each state. ", " Mitt Romney clinched the nomination on March 29 in 2012. In 2008, John McCain won the nomination on March 4 after Romney dropped out. ", " In 2008, then-Senator Barack Obama beat Hillary Clinton after a drawn-out primary that lasted into June. ", " The more populous the states the more delegates are awarded. For instance, on the Republican side, New Hampshire awards only 23 delegates while Texas awards 155. ", " Republicans must win 1,236 delegates out of 2,470. ", " Democrats need about 1200 delegates to win of around 2,383 available - a number that could change slightly between now and the convention. ", " That math works out that a candidate can shore up enough delegates after the March 15 primary where Florida, Illinois, Missouri, North Carolina and the Northern Mariana Islands votes. ", " The first four nominating states - Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada - only offer about 10 percent of the number of delegates needed for a candidate to win. Why is so much attention paid to those first states then? Momentum. ", " If a candidate can win early states, the candidate receives a lot of media attention and interest from donors which turns feeds a perception of strength which influences voters in succeeding states. Politics is a game of perception. Those who play it best win. ", " ", " ", " Washington D.C. is the last to hold its primary, which will take place on June 14th. By that point nominees in both parties are very likely to be determined. ", " After the states and territories vote in the primary, the parties hold their nominating convention. While the conventions used to be the place where the party faithful chose their nominee, in modern day politics the conventions are mostly pep rallies for the nominee: an opportunity to rally around a candidates. ", " Conventions do have one practical - and traditional - role: They signify the start of the general election, which means candidates must use a different pot of money raised and adhere to another set of campaign finance rules. ", " The Republican convention in Cleveland is July 18 - 21 and the Democratic convention in Philadelphia is July 25 - 28 in Philadelphia. ", " ", " ", " Candidates are in the final throngs of campaigning: visiting key battleground states, blanketing the airwaves with advertisements and participating in debates. ", " The debates are critical junctures in the general election that have impacted campaigns. In 2012, for instance, President Barack Obama's bad debate performance could have hindered his reelection chances except he had a much better subsequent debate against Mitt Romney, helping to salvage his campaign. ", " Election Day is November 8th - the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November, which was set by Congress in 1845. ", " But candidates must take into consideration that Election Day for many is long before November 8th. Millions of Americans in 36 states are able to vote during periods of early voting or can mail in their ballots. "]}

Democrats bounced back from three demoralizing blowout losses to win in 1992 against an incumbent, President George H.W. Bush, who seemed unbeatable earlier in his presidency.

That means winning converts among the most important planks of President Obama's winning coalition - young voters, minorities, and single women. ", " Two of the GOP candidates most prominently aligned with this \"big tent\" approach are Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush both of whom, not coincidentally, are from the very diverse swing state of Florida. The rest of the \"establishment\" side of the GOP field, including Ohio Governor John Kasich, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, and Senator Lindsey Graham fit into this camp as well. ", " In particular, candidates in this category see winning over Latino voters as a critical step towards victory. Just 27 percent went for Romney in 2012 and \"big tent\" proponents, most prominently Rubio's pollster Whit Ayres, believe that share ", " to win the White House. ", " Rubio, whose parents are Cuban immigrants and who regularly speaks to the press in Spanish, sought to address the issue by co-authoring an immigration reform bill that would put undocumented immigrants on a path to citizenship, but walked it back after a conservative revolt.

A leaked presentation the Bush campaign gave to donors this week noted that he was the most popular Republican with Latino voters in a ", " of general election match-ups. ", " The Latino vote isn't the only area where GOP candidate see growth potential. Rubio is especially focused on peeling young voters from Democrats, who won 60 percent of the under-30 set in 2012. On any given day you'll hear him talk about his student loan debt, his favorite rap song, and even that he listens to EDM (popular among young voters). Rand Paul, whose father Ron Paul was popular with college students, has aggressively tried to pull in young voters by talking about issues like high-tech surveillance. He's also made a strong pitch to black voters by emphasizing racial disparities in the justice system. ", " ", " ", " The most prominent alternative to the \"big tent\" theory, which assumes that the GOP's core voting bloc is too small to win on its own, is the \"boost the base\" theory. ", " Republicans have kept competitive with Democrats by hitting higher and higher margins with white voters - Romney's 59 percent was an improvement on George W. Bush's 58 percent in 2004, but not enough to overcome Obama's margins with non-white voters. ", " It's possible, \"boost the base\" proponents argue, that Romney's number wasn't a ceiling but the start of a trend and that Republican candidates should focus on increasing turnout and margins with conservative voting groups higher and higher - even if it means antagonizing the Obama coalition further. Pushing the GOP share of the white vote ", " might be enough to win, especially if Clinton can't replicate Obama's incredible turnout operation. ", " Candidates like Ted Cruz, who has talked about ", ", fit into this theory as do others like Bobby Jindal and Mike Huckabee whose positions and rhetoric are overwhelmingly aimed at firing up social conservatives. Donald Trump, who is ", " and loved by working-class white conservatives, belongs into this category to some degree as well. So did Scott Walker before he dropped out.

Raising margins with white voters is more likely to ", " like Ohio, Pennsylvania or Wisconsin into play. ", " The line between the two camps isn't perfect.

", " ", " ", " The dirty secret of elections is that candidates can run a perfect campaign with a prefect strategy, but the results are frequently determined by events outside their control. In the end, the best chance Republicans might have at winning is simply getting lucky. ", " One possibility is that Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders emerges weakened from the primaries - perhaps Clinton's email woes worsen or Sanders proves too extreme for general election voters. Early polls have little predictive value, but already some surveys have shown Clinton trailing Republican candidates in hypothetical match-ups - even outsiders like Trump and Carson. Some political science models, like Emory professor ", ", assume that any party trying for a third term in the White House faces significant built-in challenges. ", " Another possibility is that ", " derails the Democratic nominee. Perhaps the Federal Reserve raises interest rates too quickly and an unexpected economic slowdown drags Democrats down. A foreign policy disaster could spark a backlash against President Obama, whose approval ratings should have a major impact on whether Democrats hold the White House. ", " The Democratic nominee may start with certain advantages, but they're not nearly powerful enough to counter a toxic national environment. Take 2008, where the financial crisis and President George W. Bush's deep unpopularity helped Obama win an otherwise red state like Indiana and sent Democrats to Congress in GOP-leaning districts they had no business winning.

", " The Iowa caucuses are just over one month away and in a crowded field with no candidate near a majority of support in national and state polls, the chances that the Republican party doesn't have a clear-cut winner from the primary process appears more possible than at any time in recent history. What does all that mean? Here's a starter's guide: ", " ", " ", " A contested convention occurs when the primary process yields no candidate. ", " ", " ", " Before we explain that here's a mini-primer on how the process works: A total of 2,470 delegates are up for grabs in the primary process where all the states, territories and DC either caucus, vote or hold conventions to choose their preferable nominee. In order to secure the Republican nomination, a candidate must win a majority of delegates - or 1,236. ", " ", " ", " Each state delivers a number of delegates based on population - so more delegates are available in California than Idaho. ", " ", " ", " Another good question! That scenario could happen because of the way the system is set up. More than half of the states and territories appropriate their delegates proportionally, so theoretically three, four or five candidates could split the delegates among most of the states, leaving no candidate with a majority of delegates. ", " ", " ", " Funny, right? But that's the ironic thing about it. Two major changes by the Republican National Committee intended to clamp down on the process to ensure a long, drawn-out primary does not occur could do exactly that. ", " ", " ", " First, the convention was moved up from late August to mid-July to shorten the primary calendar. The first nominating contest is also a month later this year so that Republicans spend less time beating each other up. And in an effort to keep states from extending the primary season, the RNC placed stringent rules on the states with repercussions that would reduce the states' importance in the campaign. ", " ", " ", " For instance, any state that moved its primary or caucus before March 15th would lose its delegates, which means that the voters would have no say in the nomination process. So the unintended consequence is that while states stayed in line, more states give out their delegates proportionally, making it more difficult to reach a majority. ", " ", " ", " It goes back to the 2012 convention. A rule the Republican Party agreed on in 2012, called Rule 40, made it more difficult for a candidate to win the nomination this election season. Instead of a candidate having to win a plurality of delegates in five states, Rule 40 mandates that a candidate must win a majority of delegates in eight states before he or she is able to be considered the presumptive nominee. ", " ", " ", " That rule was intended to keep 2012 candidate Ron Paul, who won a plurality of delegates in at least five states, and his supporters from having any opportunity to take away from Mitt Romney at that year's convention. ", " But the unintended consequences is that four years later with a dozen candidates and no clear winner, that threshold could make it difficult for even the best funded candidate to meet. ", " ", " ", " The delegates at the convention, which will take place in Cleveland, vote by secret ballot. If no candidate wins a majority of delegates then a second round of voting takes place, but not before the candidates and their staffs work to win over delegates. ", " \"It's called a convention,\" Curly Haugland, Republican National Committeeman for North Dakota, said. \"A convention will break out at our convention.\" ", " Rounds of voting keeps taking place until a candidate wins the majority of the delegates. ", " ", " ", " Good question! If there's no presumptive nominee heading into the convention then there's no vice presidential presumptive nominee. In that instance, the running mate is chosen the same way - through a secret ballot by the delegates until someone obtains a majority of delegates. "]}

", " A \"Veep\"-worthy scramble ensued as the candidate's state-based spokeswoman snatched a phone being used by a reporter in the backseat and handed it to the candidate in the front, while the driver passed back the phone he was using to navigate. As the spokeswoman used one phone to text someone about the problem and the other to dial back in, it was suddenly O'Malley's turn to speak. ", " Unsure if he was actually connected, the former governor of Maryland started in with what is admittedly not the most uplifting message. Instead of asking his troops to win the Iowa caucuses, then just four days away, or even to finish in a respectable second, O'Malley was merely asking with them make him \"viable\" - to meet the threshold, in most places 15 percent, candidates need to hit to register support in the contest. ", " \"If you guys can lift me above viability in your precinct, we could change the dynamic of this race,\" he told his team in what built to an impassioned speech for survival. \"I'm going to give this 1,000 percent. We are taking this shot as if the future of the Republic depends on it - and you know what, it just might.\" ", " \"Get me above viability,\" he signed off. \"I love you guys,\" ", " After a pause, the staffer running the call confirmed that O'Malley was indeed connected. \"Well, that was harrowing,\" the candidate chuckled. ", " Running for president, even for front-runners, is often an act of humiliation. And Martin O'Malley is no front-runner. After going all in on Iowa and despite his impressive resume, the", " final poll before the caucuses showed the former Baltimore mayor at just 3 percent. ", " ", " ", " He's a favorite butt of jokes from reporters and rival campaign staffers, who poke fun at his colorful turns of phrases and poor polling. ", " But it's easy to snark and harder to try. O'Malley's underdog message of late has focused on the value of an earnest effort in a world of peanut gallery cynics, and even critics can't help but admire his zealous tenacity. ", " And laugh all you want, but O'Malley and his team are having more fun than anyone else out there, and he's got a good shot to beat your nonexistent expectations. ", " As Clinton's juggernaut struggles to conjure joy and Sanders grumpily carries the weight of the middle class on his shoulders, O'Malley is a happy warrior busking from brewpub to brewpub, liberated by his low odds to win the nomination. ", " O'Malley's hero and former boss, Gary Hart, wasn't doing much better in the polls before finishing with a respectable 16 percent in 1984. But no one seems under the apprehension that O'Malley is in anything other than a fight for basic survival. \"Growing the caucus viability beard,\" said O'Malley campaign manager Dave Hamrick as he stroked his new whiskers. ", " Getting to the viability threshold seems impossible when you're polling at 3 percent, so the universal expectation is that O'Malley will finish with 0 percent. But that assumption is based on a too simplistic view of the caucus process. ", " O'Malley's campaign has worked to build up support in concentrated precincts, including some places where turnout will be small enough that it won't take many supporters to get him over the threshold. Meanwhile, his volunteers have had some success convincing Democrats supporting other candidates to help make O'Malley viable in precincts where their top candidate is expected to win with supporters to spare. ", " ", " ", " Meanwhile, O'Malley will likely get a boost from unlikely friends in the Clinton and Sanders campaigns. In the right circumstances, clever caucus campaigns will peel off a few of their own supporters to give to a lesser candidate if keeping them viable would rob delegates from a more threatening rival. ", " To do any of that, though, he needs supporters to \"hold strong,\" the phrase he ad-libbed a few days earlier at a nationally televised forum, which has now become his closing mantra. Holding strong means that O'Malley wants his supporters to actually gather up in the caucus room and be counted, even if they fail to achieve viability, rather just slink off to join Sanders or Clinton supporters before the first break. ", " If and when his supporters have to realign, the O'Malley campaign thinks they will split fairly evenly between Clinton and Sanders. Their impact as kingmakers might be overblown. ", " O'Malley and his campaign won't reveal their target for Monday night, other than to say they want to surpass expectations. With expectations at zero, that seems very doable. ", " On Wednesday night, Drake University in Des Moines held a mock caucus. Sanders and O'Malley each got delegates, while Clinton failed to achieve viability. ", " That same night, 400 Grinnell College students and area residents packed into an auditorium that hosts the liberal arts college's caucus precinct. Hillary Clinton didn't even achieve viability here in 2008. This year, the campus, like almost every other one in the state, is dominated by Sanders fans. ", " But on Wednesday, they were all there to see O'Malley, and they were earnestly fired up. They think he's the most electable Democrat, they like that he's an underdog, they think he's been treated unfairly by the party and the press, they like that he worked across the aisle to get things done in Maryland, they like his wonkiness, they like his record, they like that he's not a socialist and not a Clinton. They like his vibe. ", " \"He has a very decent chance of mainlining viability in this precinct,\" said Kennen Goeason, who has been volunteering for O'Malley on campus. ", " ", " ", " Wearing jeans on this \"O'Malley Unplugged\" tour, the candidate took off his jacket, rolled up his sleeves and climbed onto a chair. \"I always like to give speeches standing on a chair. It adds an element of entertainment: Everybody wants to see if the presidential candidate will fall on his face,\" he said. ", " After his stump, young people circled around him like he was coolest counselor at camp. They asked him policy questions and requested selfies and handshakes. Eventually, a guitar was produced (he doesn't need to bring them to events anymore), and everyone gathered as the former governor of Maryland led the group in \"The Iowa Waltz,\" a lovely folk song by Hawkeye State native Greg Brown. ", " \"What a boss! What a boss!\" said Henry Bolster, a sophomore who plans to caucus for O'Malley. \"I fundamentally do not understand why he is not the front-runner.\" ", " O'Malley entered this race wounded, physically as well as politically. As he announced his candidacy on a sweltering late May day on a hill overlooking Baltimore, a broken elbow made his left arm a limp paperweight for his notes. He wore no sling, but the immobility was obvious if you knew to look for it. ", " Behind him, his city was still roiling in the aftermath of the death of Freddie Gray. The incident called attention to O'Malley's tough-on-crime policing and tarnished the value of his mayoral legacy. A few months earlier, his handpicked successor was swamped in the Republican midterm election wave, complicating the value of his gubernatorial legacy. ", " So it seemed like an omen when the slickly produced video meant to introduce O'Malley at the kickoff rally failed to play. The political media establishment began laughing then and hasn't really stopped, except to pretend they forgot the name of the third wheel in the Democratic Primary. ", " O'Malley can hear you sniggering, of course, and he knows what the race look like from the outside. And yet he keeps showing up, spending more time in Iowa and holding far more events here than any his rivals. ", " So why does he do it? Why endure the little humiliations, like walking past 20-something reporters to squeeze himself into the rear rows of a Delta flight? And he endures the bigger ones, like the polls. ", " Why not go home to his family and live the lucrative life a former governor, instead of dealing with this crap? ", " It's an objectively crazy thing to think you can and should be president, as even the pols who do it will tell you. But without the relentless optimism bordering on delusion shared by politicians and entrepreneurs, we would have no presidents or governors or iPhones. ", " O'Malley is a true believer who carries with him a pocket-sized book of Thomas Merton, the Catholic poet and mystic, that he reads every day. \"I feel compelled,\" he said. ", " And who knows - maybe, just maybe - Democrats might need a backup option. Many in the party think Sanders would be an unacceptable standard-bearer for the party, and Clinton has that FBI investigation looming over her head. With a slate of delegates to his name, it might logistically be easier for the party to back O'Malley than blow up the entire nominating process to draft someone else like Joe Biden. ", " Mostly, O'Malley says, what keeps him going is the people. ", " When the car pulls up to an Ames brewpub, 250 people are waiting eagerly for him. In fact, the bar is over capacity, and they're not letting anyone else in. It's a good problem, but a problem nonetheless. \"Come on, man,\" O'Malley pleads to the bouncer, without luck. ", " After shaking some hands, it's back on the chair, with his jacket off, sleeves rolled up, and, this time, a beer at hand. ", " On television, his advisers know O'Malley can come across as a bit robotic. He looks too polished and too political for a moment when anti-politicians from Donald Trump to Bernie Sanders reign supreme. \"I'm on a learning curve,\" he's said. ", " But in the bar, O'Malley is charming and easygoing and inspires confidence. He urges the crowd to \"hold strong,\" and it seems like maybe some of them will. He sticks around to chat with anyone who wants to. There's more singing and guitar playing. He loves this, the face-to-face, and clearly feeds off it. If only he could have a beer with every Democrat in the state, he might win this thing in a landslide. ", " Maybe he'll figure how to do it in another four or eight years. "]}

By contrast, Sunday night's showdown between Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, and Martin O'Malley will be only their fourth such encounter. It could also be their last one - at least their last meaningful one. ", " That will be the case if Clinton manages to win the two lead-off contests, in Iowa and New Hampshire. Demographically, these are two of Sanders' best targets in the country. If Clinton can hold him off in both places, there'll be no stopping her in South Carolina and the next wave of contests, where she already enjoys huge built-in advantages. And that would turn the next scheduled debate - on February 11, after both Iowa and New Hampshire have voted - into the political equivalent of an exhibition game. ", " So tonight is a big moment for Sanders, his last chance to go toe-to-toe with Clinton before the voting begins. At an absolute minimum, he'll need to put up a win in either Iowa or New Hampshire. That, at least, would extend some suspense through the South Carolina primary. More realistically, though, Sanders will need a clean sweep of Iowa and New Hampshire if he's to have any chance of actually stealing the nomination from Clinton - that's how strong her grip is on South Carolina and the other states that follow. ", " ", " ", " The good news for Sanders is that as of this moment he is leading in New Hampshire. His margin varies, but ", " have put him ahead of Clinton. Some chalk this up to his next-door neighbor status. Campaigning in the state earlier this month, Bill Clinton argued that \"no candidate who borders New Hampshire has ever lost a primary here, except when Howard Dean lost to John Kerry because they both did.\" (This isn't quite true. Massachusetts Senator Ted Kennedy lost the 1980 New Hampshire primary to Jimmy Carter by ten points.) ", " But this sells Sanders short. After all, when he entered the race, no one - least of all the Clinton campaign - expected that he'd be running in first place in the state three weeks before the primary. His Vermont background surely doesn't hurt, but he has to date vastly exceeded expectations in New Hampshire. ", " The same is true in Iowa, where Clinton ", " - but barely. The state is naturally suited to Sanders. Like Vermont, it is rural and largely white, with a heavy agricultural presence. But again, there is almost no one in politics who would have thought at the start of this campaign that Sanders would be so well positioned in Iowa so close to caucus day. Polls show that Sanders is essentially following the Obama model in Iowa, appealing to younger voters, political independents, and those who have never participated in the caucuses before. Only once before - with Obama in 2008 - have these voters shown up in droves on caucus day. ", " ", " ", " So the opportunity for Sanders is clear: If he can generate Obama-like turnout in Iowa, then he'll have a chance to pull off a win there on February 1. And if he can win there, then the media and political worlds will immediately look at the Democratic race very differently, giving Sanders a chance to pull away in New Hampshire and score a follow-up victory there on February 9. And if he can pull that off, then maybe - just maybe - it would be enough to convince Democrats in South Carolina, ", ", to reconsider their loyalties. ", " A particular concern for Sanders in South Carolina is African American voters, who will make up more than half of the Democratic primary electorate there and who are siding with Clinton by more than 60 points in most polls. Sanders has been trying hard to make inroads with blacks, but so far he has little to show for it. And it's more than just a South Carolina problem for him. Blacks will also hold considerable sway in the \"SEC\" states that will vote on March 1, and in other large states that follow. Without significantly increasing his share of the black vote, Sanders cannot win the nomination. ", " The bad news for Sanders is this: Clinton is good in these spots. The headlines for her have not been great in the past week: bad polling news in Iowa and New Hampshire, anger by liberals over her new attacks on Sanders, questions about how strong her position actually is. But we've been here before, and not that long ago. ", " Back in October, Clinton's grip on her party also seemed to be loosening. Just like now, Sanders was on the rise in the early states. Joe Biden was flirting with a last-minute entry into the race. And Clinton's testimony before the House Benghazi Committee loomed. If there was any panic around the Clinton campaign, though, it didn't last long. She aced the Benghazi hearing. She dominated the first Democratic debate. And Biden decided there was no room for him in the race. ", " Tonight, then, is also an opportunity for Clinton. She is very good in debates. If she can turn in another strong performance tonight, maybe knock Sanders off his game too, then those early state polls could swing right back in her direction - just as voters start to make up their minds for good. Not for the first time, we could all end up wondering: Why did we ever think she was in any trouble? ", " ", " "]}

Polls for months have shown Trump with a dominant lead there, with Rubio and Cruz competing with a handful of candidates for a distant second. Rubio may have the most to gain from his performance as he's struggled to distinguish himself in the Granite State from Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, all of whom have positioned themselves as mainstream alternatives to Cruz and Trump. The three governors each finished in the low single-digits in Iowa on Monday.

He visited all 99 counties in the state, built a volunteer army, and corralled key endorsements from the state's most prominent social conservative leaders.

The effort won him few friends in the Senate, who derided his efforts as cynical grandstanding, but raised his profile among the hardline conservatives who form the backbone of his candidacy.

", " Trump's second-place performance was a disappointment given that a number of surveys, including the prestigious Des Moines Register poll, showed him with a lead over Cruz. His reliance on non-traditional voters raised questions about his ability to turn out supporters, questions that will follow him past Iowa given the results. ", " At the same time, the New York billionaire finally demonstrated substantial support from actual voters - and not just poll respondents - for his platform of building a border wall, deporting all undocumented immigrants, renegotiating trade deals, temporarily banning Muslims from entering the country, and challenging \"political correctness\" in all forms. ", " In a departure from his usually derisive tone, Trump conceded the Iowa race to Cruz in a brief speech to supporters in West Des Moines on Monday night.

Polls showed him performing substantially worse in the days, weeks, and months ", "eading up to the caucuses but he nearly overtook Trump in the initial vote count. He was buoyed by a strong debate performance Thursday and an aggressive effort to win over evangelicals with faith-based appeals in the final days of the race. ", " Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants in Florida, became a tea party icon in 2010 when he upset the moderate then-Republican Governor Charlie Crist to win the GOP Senate nomination. He broke with supporters on the right in 2013 to co-author a legislation that would have granted a path to citizenship to undocumented immigrants. It passed the senate, died in the House thanks to conservative opposition, prompting Rubio to abandon his own proposal in favor of an incremental approach. ", " Rubio gradually rebuilt his image within the party and campaigned as a fresh face who could appeal to the party's \"three-legged stool\" of social conservatives, foreign policy conservatives, and business conservatives while winning new supporters to the party. While pundits and Republican insiders have long pegged him as a serious threat to win the nomination, his candidacy had yet to catch fire either in polls or with smalls donors. The results in Iowa are the most concrete sign yet that his efforts may be paying off and bolster his case to voters in New Hampshire that he's the strongest alternative for voters wary of Cruz and Trump.

Mike Huckabee, the Iowa caucus winner in 2008, suspended his campaign Monday night after a poor showing this time. Dr. Ben Carson also put a strong emphasis on Iowa and his campaign had to issue a statement Monday denying he would drop out after the candidate surprisingly revealed he was going home to Florida for a rest before hitting the campaign trail again.

", " \"We'll do 90-minutes, Lincoln-Douglas, mano-a-mano, Donald and me,\" Cruz roared to a crowd in Fairfield, Iowa, on Tuesday night. Trump had announced just an hour earlier that he would not participate in the GOP debate on Thursday night. ", " And he began to frame the caucuses as a two-person race, solely between himself and Trump, dismissing the rest of the field as inconsequential. ", " Cruz promoted himself as Trump's sole competitor, telling a crowd in Waterloo this weekend, \"more and more observers are saying this race is coming down to a two-man race between me and Donald Trump.\" ", " His campaign manager, Jeff Roe, said after Thursday night's GOP debate, \"I mean, clearly, it's a two-man race.\" ", " Rep. Steve King, Cruz's national co-chair, opened the door a little more, suggesting, \"It's a two-man \u2014 potential distant third \u2014 race now.\" ", " Cruz took his analysis of the race a step further last week, pushing the narrative that the \"Washington establishment\" had abandoned the likes of Marco Rubio and is \"rushing over to support Donald Trump,\" framing Rubio as no longer a player in the race. ", " Cruz' became the focus of an onslaught of negative attacks from a wide array of Republican figures and interest groups in recent weeks. ", " Iowa Governor Terry Branstad said last week that Cruz would be \"damaging\" to the state. Sarah Palin appeared in Ames to endorse Trump over her former Tea Party star Cruz. A pro-Marco Rubio super PAC began running incessant attack ads on Iowa airwaves. ", " The Trump campaign has released its own set of attack ads hitting Cruz on immigration. And even a pro-Huckabee super PAC hit Iowa television on Wednesday with an ad questioning Cruz's commitment to his faith and Christianity. ", " But perhaps the greatest bruise landed to Cruz has been a messaging blitz by a pro-ethanol group in Iowa, America's Renewable Future, which has effectively seeped its anti-Cruz advertising out to farmers across the state. Cruz is now confronted at nearly each of his Iowa campaign stops over his position against the Renewable Fuel Standard, a key economic policy in the state. ", " Taken together, the attacks appear to have damaged both Cruz's support and his popularity in the state. And a number of his opponents stand to benefit. ", " Other rival campaigns, including Marco Rubio's team, see potential cracks in Cruz's shell, opening an opportunity to climb and gain greater relevance in the Hawkeye State. ", " Voters consistently expressed interest in Rubio through the summer and fall, but with a late spree by the candidate on the ground this winter, the Florida senator could continue to chip off late support. The candidates could receive potential boosts by Republicans who intended to caucus for Bush, Christie or Kasich but are now looking for a more viable alternative to challenge Cruz and Trump. ", " The Cruz camp maintains an optimistic tone. ", " \"[The Rubio campaign has] done nothing to show they are organized or raised money to win beyond [the first voting states],\" a Cruz aide told NBC News last week. \"So they're not going to [win it].\" ", " The campaigns of Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum also see a window. The pair intend to travel directly to South Carolina after Iowa and spend the extra week making inroads into the evangelical, conservative electorate there if they foresee fragility in Cruz's grasp on that demographic.

More delegates come beginning on March 1 \u2014 also known as Super Tuesday \u2014 when 11 states will compete all at once. That includes many states in the South with large nonwhite populations. ", " Campaigns had one last chance to sway caucusgoers inside the room at the 1,681 precincts across the state of Iowa. There's no secret ballot for Iowa Democrats, and the entire precinct gathers at once, so it's a very public affair with plenty of peer pressure. ", " In 2008, 11% of Democratic caucusgoers said they made up their mind the night of the caucus, and those that did broke heavily for Barack Obama over Hillary Clinton, which many chalked up to infectious energy of the underdog's backers.

", " In the past several days, GOP candidates have unveiled high-profile supporters that they hope will persuade the undecided and perhaps find an eleventh-hour edge in a tight race. ", " What's more is that endorsements are part of a campaign's political strategy and often emphasize the strengths and weaknesses of each candidate. ", " Republican front-runner Donald Trump in particular had a busy week, announcing a series of influential characters that appeal to targeted demographics. ", " In Iowa, Trump recently announced high-profile support from conservative figureheads like former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin and Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr. On Tuesday, controversial Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio added his name -- and record of tough immigration enforcement -- to the list of Trump endorsers. ", " Those endorsements have strategic implications. In Arpaio, Trump gets a tough-on-immigration supporter to bolster his own positions on the issue while countering one of Ted Cruz's biggest champions, Iowa Congressman Steve King - one of the most outspoken critics of immigration in Congress. ", " With the Falwell endorsement, Trump gained the official backing of a well respected evangelical name, a move that could push Christian conservatives toward him, and away from Cruz. The evangelical vote is critical in the Iowa caucus as 55 percent of Republican caucus participants identify as evangelical. And Palin, a Tea Party fixture, bolsters his outsider and conservative credentials. ", " Trump's play for conservative evangelicals was a blow to the bloc of Republican candidates running their campaign by appealing to the Christian base, including Ben Carson and Mike Huckabee. But it is most damaging to Cruz, Trump's closest competitor in Iowa. Cruz had already received the support of Bob Vander Plaats, the head of the The Family Leader who has a significant following there. ", " But needing another shot of energy and working to remind voters that he is the true Christian in the race, Cruz responded to the Falwell endorsement by unveiling his own big-name evangelical. Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, threw their weight behind Cruz Tuesday, perhaps giving comfort to evangelicals who aren't supportive of Trump and also a sign how divided evangelicals in the Hawkeye State. ", " While it's not clear if a political endorsement translates into actual votes, endorsements do matter. It gives candidates a positive news story, and history shows that the winner of the primary in modern politics has won the most number of endorsements by party officials. ", " But in this Republican primary, where the conventional means little (for example: the leading candidates have spent the least amount on advertising), the impact of support by the party elite might not mean what it used to. ", " Trump, for instance, hasn't received the official backing of any current or former members of Congress, senators or governors - a traditional indicator of electoral success. ", " Instead he's rolling out the support of celebrities, entertainers and unelected conservatives. ", " His backers include pro-baller Dennis Rodman, former NFL player Terrell Owens, former boxer Mike Tyson, former basketball coach Bobby Knight, pro-wrestler Hulk Hogan, actor Steve Baldwin, singer Ted Nugent, singer Wayne Newtown, John Wayne's daughter and conservative commentator Ann Coulter. ", " Cruz, who has not gained the support of any of his colleagues in the Senate, is also turning elsewhere to bolster his bona fides. Conservative media mogul Glenn Beck and fellow Texan Rick Perry, the former governor of the Lone Star State, is behind Cruz. ", " Former Florida governor Jeb Bush, who entered the presidential race cursed with high expectations to coast through the nomination process to an easy victory, racked up a significant number of endorsements early in his campaign. Bush's support among national elected officials is large - totaling more than four dozen former federally elected officials and more than two dozen currently in office. But as actual voting nears, his endorsements have slowed save for South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham who dropped out of the presidential race in December. ", " Meanwhile, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, has generated the support of several of his senate colleagues and nearly two dozen members of the House of Representatives, especially the ones who are younger and represent a younger generation of politician. His endorsements are emblematic of his entire campaign theme of new leadership. ", " While she has no plans on endorsing before Iowa, a young-dynamic insurgent freshman Sen. Joni Ernst who won a five-way Republican primary before she won her senate seat 2014, appeared with Rubio this week. . Ernst hasn't appeared with any other candidate but her office hasn't ruled it out, saying she would if \"we can fit it into (the) schedule.\" ", " Rubio is also winning the support among the practical, those who ponder electability and rationality. ", " Iowa's largest newspaper, the Des Moines Register, wrote, \"We endorse him because he represents his party's best hope,\" Former New York Governor and presidential candidate George Pataki said he's the one who can beat Democrat Hillary Clinton in a general election - another major theme of Rubio's campaign. ", " New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and Ohio Governor John Kasich, two candidates whose strategy is to put most of their time and resources into the more moderate primary state of New Hampshire, have focused on obtaining local endorsements, hoping to influence locals there. ", " Christie's list of endorsements in ", " is long and Kasich's while Kasich's is too. Their strategy is paying dividends as the two major Boston newspapers, both of which reach New Hampshire voters, split their endorsements this week. The Boston Globe said a vote for Kasich \"would deal a blow to the demagogic candidates running on campaign simplicities.\" The Boston Herald backed Christie. ", " In his campaign, Kasich is also touting his time as head of the Budget Committee where he helped to usher in a balanced budget. To highlight that, Kasich has secured the backing of two dozen of his former colleagues in the House. ", " Almost as important as the endorsement is the anti-endorsement. And Trump and Cruz - the frontrunners with targets on their backs - appear to be winning that race. ", " Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad said he would not endorse before the caucuses, but he told reporters last week that Cruz would be \"very damaging to our state.\" ", " Trump has received the most public backlash. Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse, tweeted a list of questions to Trump that might as well have been in a rival's folder of opposition research. ", " He asked Trump why he previously supported single payer health care, \"hate(d) the concept of guns,\" proposed a \"$6trillion tax hike,\" and touted \"many affairs w/ married women.\" ", " Sasse will campaign with Rubio and Cruz this week. ", " While Trump enjoys the support of some celebrities mentioned above, he has also drawn the public ire of others. A campaign called \"StopHateDumpTrump has been launched and is supported by more than a hundred celebrities and activists, including actress Cynthia Nixon and feminist attorney Gloria Steinem. ", " Despite Trump's detractors, his supporters come from unlikely places. As a candidate who has shunned the grit of hand-shaking, selfie-taking, baby-kissing retail politics, the owner of an Iowa pizza chain that has become synonymous for Republican retail politics, endorsed Trump, too. ", " While it may not influence any votes, it forced Trump to stop at a Pizza Ranch. "]}

Campaign aides believe the legislators appearing on stage with Carson can help increase their candidate's perceived legitimacy, which could build momentum as he works to close the deal with undecided voters.  ", " There have also been noticeable shifts since the departure of his top aides. There's been an aggressive, and admittedly belated, rollout of policy proposals. Four, including cyber security, taxes, education and terrorism, were released in the past three weeks. Friends, aides, and Carson himself note an increased energy level from the candidate \u2014 with some saying he physically appears to be happier with his new staff.

In October, she endured a grueling 11-hour hearing in from of the House Benghazi committee - a punctuation mark to months of congressional hearings and investigations on the attacks on the U.S. compound in Libya.

Later, after taking a question on immigration, he complained that certain candidates were \"in the witness protection\" when the topic of legalization came up, but again declined to name names.

The same poll pegged Bush at 2 percent in a four-way tie for seventh place.

", " In many ways, Bush is closing his Iowa campaign the same way it began, pitching himself as an experienced hand and even-keeled personality in a field filled with untested neophytes and erratic outsiders. ", " Throughout the day, Bush focused on national security issues in his remarks, in which he derided President Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for believing they could \"lead from behind.\" He brought along two Medal of Honor winners, who underscored Bush's serious tone with harrowing war stories, and boasted about the many military leaders advising him.

", " Sanders is hoping to repeat the 2008 playbook of energizing young people and first-time caucus-goers that led Barack Obama to beat Clinton here. It's working \u2014 he's pulled even with her overall and is leading Clinton by more than 2-to-1 among people under 45, ", " ", " poll, and by nearly 20 percentage points among people who plan to attend their first caucuses. ", " Where Obama succeeded in changing the fundamental makeup of the electorate, many candidates have failed after making similar promises, including Howard Dean in 2004 and Bill Bradley in 2000. Young people and first-time caucus-goers are just harder to turn out, and many observers believe Sanders' biggest challenge will be getting his supporters to actually show up. ", " As difficult a challenge as that is, Sanders' bigger difficulty may be geography. ", " Iowa is a caucus not a primary. That means a supporter in one place is not necessary as valuable as a supporter in another place. ", " Just like how the electoral college system makes it so extra Democrats votes are worth less in Vermont than in Ohio, the caucus process makes it so extra supporters in a heavily Sanders precinct are worth less than if they were in a battleground precinct. ", " Obama won in 2008 by flooding caucuses with young people and first-time caucus-goers \u2014 that was icing on the cake of a statewide caucus operation that focused on more traditional caucus-goers. ", " For Sanders, \"the icing came first for them and they're trying to build cake underneath it,\" said Jeff Link, the longtime strategist to former Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin. ", " Take the university towns: More than a quarter \u2014 27 percent \u2014 of Sanders supporters come from just three counties of Iowa's 99, according to the", " poll, each home to one of the state's largest universities. But those three counties award only 12 percent of the total 1401 delegates at stake statewide. ", " \"He's setting the world on fire on the college campuses,\" Link explained. \"That's great if you're in a primary, but it's not as much if you're in a caucus.\" ", " Unlike the electoral college, however, the caucuses are not winner-take-all, so delegates will be awarded even for second and third-place finishers. Delegates are awarded to candidates based on a complicated process, but how many delegates can be won at each precinct or county is fixed. It's assigned by the party based on history, and does not change no matter how many people show up. That means that Sanders could double, triple or even quintuple support in a precinct, but can only win so many delegates there. ", " Obama crushed all three university counties, along with the delegate-rich population centers of Polk (Des Moines), Linn (Cedar Rapids), and Scott (Davenport), where Sanders is also likely to perform well. But Obama also won more counties overall than Clinton or second-place finisher John Edwards, claiming broad swaths of the the state, from tiny Van Buren County, which assigned just 5 delegates, to medium-sized Muscatine, which assigned 32. ", " Even if Sanders racks up delegates in population centers, Clinton can beat him by winning dozens of smaller counties. ", " \"If he doesn't have a statewide organization, it's going to be death by a thousand cuts,\" said Norm Sterzenbach, a former executive director of the Iowa Democratic Party. \"I would rather have geographic diversity than a ton of enthusiasm, concentrated.\" ", " Clinton's team, which includes many of the people who engineered Obama's 2008 win, has been on the ground in more places longer than Sanders'. And organizers say there's no way to make up the lost time when it comes to volunteer training and relationship building. ", " Sterzenbach expects Sanders' enthusiasm-driven machine to dominate in the 15-20 counties with larger cities or universities \u2014 but for Clinton's blood, sweat, and time machine to pay dividends in the 50-60 more rural counties. ", " For instance, Clinton won almost every county along the Missouri River in the western part of the state, which Democrats tend to ignore in general elections because the area is so heavily Republican. While each county on it's own is not worth many delegates, they add up. ", " Sanders strategists acknowledge they got a later start and have been working overtime to address it. In the past few weeks, he's been spending more time visiting smaller and midsize counties that don't necessarily vote Democratic in general elections. ", " Still, the campaign gets excited by large crowds. On Sunday, Sanders addressed 2,300 at Luther College in Decorah, a town of just 8,000. But as Sterzenbach pointed out, Winneshiek gets just 11 delegates \u2014 less than", " of the total. ", " And Obama had one other critical advantage that mitigated his geography problem. ", " In 2008, the caucuses were held on Jan. 3, when most college students were home on winter break. That meant that Obama's army of young supporters could caucus at their parents' homes all over the state, and not waste their support in Johnson or Story counties, home to the University of Iowa and Iowa State University, respectively. ", " The Sanders campaign is working to encourage college students to return home to caucus, and helping to arrange travel. But it's a big organizational lift and asking a lot of a demographic that has historically already been reluctant to turn out. The caucuses are on a Monday night, so students will have classes on the day of the caucuses and the next morning. ", " \"I still think HRC by 5 in Iowa,\" Mitch Stewart, who was Obama's director of field operations for the Iowa Caucuses in 2008 and now backs Clinton, said in a tweet Saturday. ", " Still, Sanders has dramatically expanded his team across Iowa to match or even outsize Clinton's, and is working hard to make up for lost time. And his genuine, organic enthusiasm could swamp all of Clinton's best laid plans. It's also possible that the polls are missing non-traditional caucus-goers. "]}

In Rick Santorum's case, you mostly just want to give him a hug. ", " The ex-senator who won the Iowa caucus in 2012 can't seem to find any traction this time in the Hawkeye State or anywhere else. Barring a miracle, Thursday's undercard debate was likely his last chance to get his message out to a national audience. Currently, that message includes a lot of complaints about the debate itself. ", " \"This race, this debate, was called the 'Undercard debate.' The undercard debate,\" Santorum said in his first answer. \"It wasn't advertised significantly. In fact, the entire hour lead up to this there was no conversation about any of the four people on this debate stage, and that is the chronic situation.\" ", " After the debate, Santorum met reporters in the spin room, where he continued to pile on Fox News, complaining he hadn't been booked on Megyn Kelly or Bill O'Reilly during the race while \"a certain candidate in the race\" with high ratings value enjoyed unfettered access. ", " \"This is a guy who won the Iowa caucuses four years ago,\" he said. \"I know by speaking out, Roger Ailes will have a field day to make sure I don't have access to his shows in the future, but at some point you have to speak out and realize the game is being stacked.\" ", " It's hard for any candidate to lose gracefully, but even within the large group of Republican also-rans, Santorum is going out in exceptionally bitter fashion. ", " As the senator described it on Thursday night, he was the victim of a vicious cycle. He has decades of scars from fighting abortion and same-sex marriage alongside the Christian conservatives who turned out for him four years ago. But with Trump sucking up attention, he can't get coverage, and without coverage he can't move up in the polls, and without moving up in the polls, voters see him as a lost cause. ", " \"We hear this all the time: 'We really like you, we really want to support you, but we aren't sure you can win,'\" he told me. \"And why aren't they sure I can win? Because nobody ever talks about Rick Santorum!\" ", " With that, Santorum left for a special guest appearance with the same person he had just complained to the press had hijacked the political conversation: Donald Trump. If you can't beat 'em, join 'em. ", " At the event, a hastily arranged veterans fundraiser to counterprogram the Fox debate, Trump - after one of his signature self-aggrandizing monologues - called on Santorum to speak. The podium, however, was emblazed with a giant logo for Trump. Wary of being caught on camera with his rival's campaign material below him, Santorum awkwardly stood to the left of the sign and leaned into the microphone to speak. ", " \"I'm supporting another candidate for president,\" he explained to the crowd. \"That doesn't mean we can't work together when it comes to helping our veterans.\" ", " The next morning, Santorum was scheduled to arrive at a town hall at the Heritage Gallery in downtown Des Moines, which is hosting an exhibition of photos and art featuring presidential candidates. ", " All his tormentors were there on the walls. There was a pop art Marco Rubio, a sepia-toned Rand Paul, an installation of illustrated \"Trumpisms,\" as well as some depictions of his fallen foes, like a stark black-and-white Scott Walker. ", " Arriving first were three devoted out-of-state Santorum supporters who had driven long distances to volunteer for him. \"A lot of people in Iowa know Rick and obviously like Rick and I feel very encouraged about things,\" said Dan Minick, a 66-year old who knew Santorum from his senate days and had driven from Pennsylvania to support him. ", " About two-dozen more people filed into the exhibit. It was the kind of group that tends to show up for a fringe contender. There were activists on a mission to grill the entire field on a specific issue - Social Security, patent law, the gold standard. One man in a Jesus fish tie showed up to get Santorum to autograph his weathered Holy Bible, which already featured signatures from Carly Fiorina, Jeb Bush, and two from Rafael Cruz, the father of Senator Ted Cruz. ", " Much of the crowd consisted of Chinese teenagers in matching blue t-shirts visiting Iowa as part of a program to learn about American democracy. Two students visiting from Mercer College in Georgia for a political science class showed up to see the last Iowa winner in person. One was voting for Bernie Sanders, the other for Hillary Clinton. ", " Frank Luntz, the GOP messaging expert and Fox News commentator, milled about looking at the exhibit. To him, Santorum's problem was not any media conspiracy to shut him out, but instead tougher competition than 2012, when Santorum was one of the few conservative alternatives to Mitt Romney. \"It's the strongest Republican field in the time I've been alive,\" he said. \"It's that easy.\" ", " Santorum walked in, pursued by several cameramen, and spotted Luntz, who he buttonholed for another extended whine session about everything wrong with the media and debates as gallery visitors quietly looked on. ", " \"\u2026Their job is to do what their board members want them to do, which is make a profit\u2026\" ", " \"\u2026The whole concept of bifurcated debates from the beginning\u2026\" ", " \"\u2026Four years ago, yes, I was on the debate stage, but if you look at my time in the debates\u2026\" ", " Finally, he made his way to the back of the gallery where there was a section devoted just to him. He stood directly in front of a screen showing images from his comeback run in 2012: Santorum hunting, Santorum smiling from a podium, Santorum shaking hands. ", " Dave Davidson, the photographer behind the exhibition, introduced Santorum to the crowd. He took special pride in showing off a new art piece composed of tweets from a parody account of Santorum's signature sweater vest from his heyday four years ago. ", " \"How many of you know Rick's sweater vest?\" he asked. Three or four hands shot up. ", " Santorum delivered a short speech warning voters not to overlook decades of government experience in favor of a political neophyte who will \"pull the pin, drop a grenade, and walk away.\" He compared nominating one of the outsider candidates to replacing a football coaching staff with nuclear physicists. ", " \"If you believe the national polls - which I don't - the more experience, the more record of accomplishment you have, the lower you're doing in the polls,\" he said. ", " He took some questions. There was a mildly combative exchange over racism in the justice system and another one over defunding Planned Parenthood. Then one man asked about vocational schools and manufacturing jobs and Santorum lit up. ", " \"Have you been coming to my town halls?\" he asked. He told him he had pledged to make America the number one manufacturer in the world and had all sorts of ideas to encourage work training in high schools and how affordable useful degrees were often more important than $70,000 liberal arts ones. ", " In fact, manufacturing has been one of Santorum's top issues for years. His biggest complaint about Mitt Romney after President Obama's re-election was that he failed to engage blue-collar voters and psyched up their bosses instead. Trump, who talks about factory jobs and trade imbalances in blustery terms, picked up this baton and ran with it. ", " \"People say my message doesn't resonate,'\" he told me after the event. \"I say no, my message has been replicated.\" ", " It's one of the ironies of Santorum's presently low position. In many ways, he predicted the Republican electorate's mood correctly and earlier than some of its top contenders. ", " Long before Trump declared for president, Santorum - alone among Republican contenders - was delivering speeches decrying not just illegal immigration, but legal immigration as well, which he complained was driving down workers' wages. Now much of the field has shifted right on the issue, with Trump calling for a freeze on immigration levels and Cruz following with a similar proposal after previously supporting major increases in work visas and green cards. ", " \"I can't complain when I hear my lines being repeated by other candidates that I said four years ago,\" he said. \"It's flattering, but I can understand how voters can say 'Well there's not much difference between candidates on these issues.' It's like whether you want Kleenex or generic tissues.\" ", " Maybe the cruelest part of Santorum's current position is that he's already had one miracle comeback, which makes it impossible to let go of the hope for a second one. ", " For nearly the entire 2012 race he was almost as marginal a presence as he was this cycle. Flavor-of-the-month candidates like Michele Bachmann and Herman Cain shot above him then crashed to earth until eventually he got a hard look. Polls put him near the bottom of the field in Iowa, where he had put all his energy, as late as a week before the vote. ", " I asked Santorum when he realized his luck had turned in the last Iowa contest. ", " \"Really, just the last couple of days,\" he said. ", " There are two days before the Iowa caucus. "]}

The senator has to hope his own highlights and whatever backlash Trump gets for skipping out (if there is any) can reverse his polling slide. Cruz spokesman Rick Tyler told reporters afterwards that Trump's absence \"spoke for itself.\" ", " Jeb Bush joked he missed Trump, who \"was a little teddy bear to me.\" But rather than use that line to pivot to an attack on Trump, he instead chastised his rivals for not attacking Trump themselves. \"Everyone else was in the witness protection program when I went after him,\" he complained. ", " Washington Post reporter Ed O'Keefe asked Cruz after the debate if he missed having Trump around. ", " \"He's always with us,\" Cruz responded. ", " One reason it was so hard to pretend Trump wasn't in the room is that - as becomes clearer every debate - candidates have absorbed so many of his positions and rhetoric. Trump may have been gone, but Trumpism hung in the air. ", " The main fireworks were on immigration, a topic that almost everyone on stage had at least flirted with more moderate views on in a less heated time for the party. With the issue turbocharged by Trump, they now lobbed the toughest attacks of the night at each other over the topic, regardless of their current or former position. ", " Bush, who supports a pathway to legal status for immigrants but whose super PAC is running ads attacking Rubio's \"amnesty\" bill, squared off with Rubio, who was confronted by the moderators with clips of him pledging not to pursue a path to legal status as a Senate candidate. ", " \"You used to support a path to citizenship,\" Rubio shot at Bush. ", " \"So did you!\" Bush responded. ", " Paul, channeling Trump to denounce Rubio's bill, said, \"You can't be in favor of defending us from radical Islam if you're not in favor of border security.\" ", " Ted Cruz, who avoided taking a position on legal status for undocumented immigrants for years, now boasted that his plan was \"designed with Iowa's own Congressman Steve King and Jeff Sessions,\" the best known anti-immigration hardliners in Congress. It's not at all clear this is what things would look like for him if Trump never ran. ", " Part of the reason for the lack of attacks on Trump is due to a collective action problem. For nearly everyone running, the most important immediate goal is to knock off his or her most similar rivals before taking on the front-runner with a unified base. Only Cruz, who faces a mortal threat in Iowa from Trump, is urgently working to confront him now. ", " Bush was asked about this dynamic during the debate, specifically why the independent super PAC supporting him is spending tens of millions of dollars attacking Rubio. ", " \"This is beanbag compared to what the Clinton hit machine is going to do to the Republican nominee,\" Bush said. ", " As the lengthy immigration portion indicated, that meant candidates had plenty of reason to go after each other. After the moderators played video of Cruz explaining his amendment to strip a path to citizenship from Rubio's bill but leave its legalization component in place, Rubio and Paul pounced. ", " \"He's the king of saying 'Oh, you're for amnesty, everyone's for amnesty except Ted Cruz,' but it's a falseness, and that's an authenticity problem,\" Paul said. ", " \"This is the lie that Ted's campaign is built on,\" Rubio said, following up. \"That he's the most conservative guy and everyone else is a RINO. The truth is throughout this campaign, Ted, you've been willing to do anything or say anything to get votes.\" ", " That left an opening for Christie, who argued the debate over esoteric amendments and failed legislation indicted all the senators onstage. ", " \"Stop the Washington bull and let's get things done!\" he said. ", " In general, the debate was less combative than the last one in South Carolina, which was one of the most contentious of the campaign. But the infighting benefits Trump, and the battles were largely fought on his territory. "]}

The huge numbers included younger voters and independent voters, and led to overflow crowds in the schools and firehouses where Democrats caucuses. By comparison, about 118,000 Republicans caucused in 2008, and 121,500 in 2012.

Brooks said that not only is supply-side economics not necessarily the answer, but that Republicans are losing an untapped voter market by not speaking to poor people.

He moderated the event in Columbia, South Carolina, where most of the seven presidential candidates who attended endorsed central components of his domestic policy agenda. ", " While anti-establishment candidates, Donald Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz, did not attend and are not seeking Ryan's endorsement, seven others did and they would covet an endorsement by him. The support of the speaker, who is still popular among the raucous ranks of House Republicans in the infancy of his term, could bring with his endorsement a tremendous amount of political favor. His support could not only influence other critical and influential players, but it could direct millions of dollars to Ryan's preferred candidate as his growing donor pool could follow his lead. ", " ", " ", " An appeal to him was on full display Saturday. Ryan, who has shown an interest in the issue of poverty since his loss on the 2012 Republican presidential ticket, has encouraged Republicans to remember the poor in their policy discussions and speak with more compassion about the nearly 47 million Americans living in poverty. The candidates, who have rarely mentioned the issue on the campaign trail up until now, not only espoused a softer tone about the poor, but proposed ideas similar to Ryan's, showing him that he would have a partner in the White House. (South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley also attended the forum. She is often touted as a potential vice presidential pick.) ", " At Saturday's forum, hosted by the Kemp Foundation, which was founded by Ryan's late mentor and former Republican presidential candidate Jack Kemp, was attended by Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, John Kasich, Mike Huckabee, Carly Fiorina and Ben Carson. ", " One of the central components to addressing poverty were versions of Ryan's proposal to block grant safety net programs, including food stamps, officially called SNAP (Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program) and welfare, or TANF (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families.) ", " In 2014, Ryan, who was head of the House Budget Committee at the time, proposed \"Opportunity Grants\" that take federal funding for federal safety net programs, repackage it and grant the money to the states for each state to administer the program and set the program's parameters. ", " It's a proposal backed at least by Bush, Carson, Rubio and Kasich. ", " \"Shift all of this back to communities,\" Bush said. \"The state federal relationship would be focused on outcomes.\" ", " Kasich agrees: \"I would ship the whole welfare program back to the states, with guardrails though.\" ", " And Carson, too: \"That's why I think almost, or at least a very large number of federal programs need to be block granted back to the states at 80%.\" ", " While it appeals to Ryan, it's a controversial proposal that is aggressively opposed by most Democrats. ", " Rebecca Vallas, director of anti-poverty policy at the Center for American Progress Action Fund, said block-granting is another way of \"slashing federal poverty programs.\" ", " \"If you want to eliminate of slash programs, at least be honest about it instead of cloaking it in false, compassionate rhetoric,\" Vallas said. ", " By switching a federal safety-net program to a block grant, the program loses it's entitlement status, therefore losing the legal requirement for the program to be fully funded. Vallas points to TANF, which was block-granted in 1996 in an agreement between Congressional Republicans and President Bill Clinton. She says block-granting has failed because today only one out of four families living in poverty have access to TANF support compared to two out of three families living in poverty who received benefits before 1996. ", " Another proposal echoed by the candidates and backed by Ryan is one that has bipartisan support: the expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit. Criminal justice reform was also a popular topic that is also receiving support from both Republicans and Democrats. "]}

I don't know, but I wouldn't be surprised if he does better than we expect.\" ", " And to Huckabee's aid, several evangelical leaders in the state firmly dismiss the idea that Cruz has wrapped up the support of Iowa's evangelicals, who make up a majority of the GOP electorate in the state. ", " \"There's a lot more to this story than suggestions it's locked down for Ted Cruz \u2014 because it's not,\" said Jenifer Bowen, the head of Iowa Right to Life. \"You have Rubio supporters.

It's enough to make Iowans long for a return to the days of too many awkward Viagra ads and low-budget local car dealer commercials.

He doesn't tithe? I heard he's a millionaire,\" a woman muses in the spot. ", " After a few minutes of Limbaugh's program, another commercial break featured yet another ad -- this one for Carly Fiorina. ", " Before pulling into his suburban West Des Moines driveway, Freed lets us in on a secret: listen to a radio station that doesn't air any commercials. \"If you want to avoid political ads here in Iowa, listen to 107.1, the local Christian radio station,\" he said.

Only one piece of mail expressed support for Bush, while the other two critiqued his rivals. One attacked New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, while the other attacked both Christie and Kasich, two candidates appealing to the same fiscally-oriented moderate Republicans. ", " \"I have not read a single one of these. I usually look and see who they're from and throw them in the garbage,\" Freed said. \"They don't really have much impact on me. The debates and those sort of actual informative policy discussions are going to have a lot more influence on me.\" ", " Sitting down to watch 30 minutes of network television, Freed had the same experience as Hibbs. Almost every single commercial was a political ad, with both parties equally over-saturating the airwaves. ", " Florida Sen. Marco Rubio was well-represented on the screen. Freed saw three pro-Marco Rubio ads mixed in with two anti-Rubio spots bought by Right to Rise. An ad aired for Cruz as well. ", " But two Democratic candidates dominated the 4:00 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. block with four advertisements by Hillary Clinton and four by Bernie Sanders, including at least one 60-second ad from each. ", " Even with the sheer quantity of political TV ads, Freed, who loves politics and has been active in the Republican party for most of his adult life -- including a five-year stint working for Sen. Chuck Grassley in Washington, D.C. -- said he doesn't fast-forward through the commercial breaks. ", " \"I kinda like to listen to them,\" Freed said. \"I kind of find them entertaining.\" ", " Largely missing from Freed's contact with the campaigns is Donald Trump. ", " Freed is not a Trump supporter. He doesn't think Trump could beat a Democrat and as a Christian, he says Trump has \"a potentially damaging effect\" on people of his own faith because of the way he talks about immigrants and Muslims. ", " Still, that didn't stop Trump's campaign from calling Freed last week and urging him to attend a Trump rally in Ames, Iowa, 45 minutes from his home. ", " The reason Trump's presence isn't heavily felt is that he has spent little money in Iowa. Trump has only spent money in the state since the beginning of January, and ", " on TV ads as of last week. ", " Even if the constant blizzard of political engagement is exhausting, a major upside to the process is that Freed can meet almost any candidate he'd like. In fact, he's met Christie, Fiorina, Kasich, Huckabee, Santorum, as well as former Texas Governor Rick Perry and Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker before they dropped out. ", " One of the few people he hasn't met is Rubio, the one candidate he's most interested in. ", " But it's the week before the caucuses and Rubio is just a ten minute drive away. ", " Freed, his wife Alicia and his three children drove to the Sheraton in West Des Moines to listen to Rubio's stump speech. ", " \"We get so many emails so many phone calls so many voice mails that you can not possibly begin to read all of the information so coming here to meet the candidate person is by far the most effective way to close the deal with any caucus-goer I think,\" Freed said.

", " So, the person who we call the \"winner\" on Caucus Night is the candidate who accrues the most state delegate equivalents, a number calculated using a ratio of state-to-county convention delegates. ", " The Iowa Democratic Party says there will be a total of 1,406 state delegates. So, if you see for example that Hillary Clinton gets 55% on caucus night, that means she won 55% (or 773) of the state delegate equivalents. ", " Make sense? ", " ", " ", " By contrast, Republicans select their candidate via a simple, secret-ballot vote. ", " There is no shuffling from one corner of the caucus site to the other. There is no 15 percent viability or realignment. And there's no mathematical formula to determine delegates awarded at each caucus site. ", " For example, say there are four candidates (Candidates A, B, C, D), 100 total attendees, and the site awards seven delegates.

", " In scores of interviews with voters in Eastern Iowa in the four days leading up to the caucuses, several themes emerged: ", " 1. ", " ", " The rise of Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump has led to much discussion of an angry, fearful American electorate, with some data supporting that. ", " But people interviewed here described their feelings in terms more like discouragement than anger. Those over age 60, both Democrats and Republicans, are worried that their children and grandchildren won't have the same kind of life they did. In their words, this is not nostalgia, but an honest assessment of an America in which jobs are outsourced, careers fleeting and retirement pensions are increasingly non-existent. ", " The voters under 50 were often experiencing this directly. Many had children who were struggling to find steady jobs or pay off college loans. Some were anxious about what they felt were excessive costs for things that they think all Americans should be entitled to, particularly affordable health care and college tuition. ", " \"I'm middle class, I'm not struggling,\" said Sue Clemens, a 65-year-old occupational therapist in Davenport who backed Clinton. \"I pay my fair share, everybody ought to. I worry about my kids.\" ", " She said she understood the appeal of Trump, noting, \"There are a lot of rural areas in Iowa, there are so many people who just want a fair shake.\" ", " Jonathan Neavor, a 32-year-old who lives in Davenport, said the idea of free college tuition, as Sanders proposes, has deep appeal to him, because he had stopped attending the University of Iowa because he and his family couldn't afford it. ", " \"I am still paying $100 a month for the year and half I was there,\" said Neavor, who is backing Sanders. ", " He added, \"I'm not a fan of late-stage capitalism. We should not be afraid of socialism, countries like Sweden are doing a lot better than us on a lot of things.\" ", " Karene Nagel, a retired health care worker backing Sanders, said, \"I have friends with two jobs looking for a third.\" ", " At times, these worries seemed overstated. One Republican woman, who was attending a Trump rally in Clinton, Iowa, but said she was leaning towards Jeb Bush, described the struggles of her daughter and son-in-law to find jobs after the law school. She lamented paying for the couple's housing and bar exam fees after they graduated and how they struggled to find legal jobs in Iowa. ", " After 10 minutes of listing the challenges, she concluded the story: her daughter and son-in-law had found jobs as lawyers in Washington, D.C. and were repaying their loans on time. ", " The angst of the voters here is telling, in that it is likely to be higher in other states. The jobless rate in Iowa is 3.4 percent, much lower than the 5.0 national average. ", " \"I remember when this was a great country,\" said 68-year-old Pat Toppins, who backed Trump. \"Now, we don't have any jobs. Our industrial base has been shipped out. Our health care industry is corrupt. Our children aren't being educated. It's almost as though this country has been abandoned.\" ", " \"We have fantastic technology, like Apple,\" he said. \"But all the jobs that build the technology are out of this country.\" ", " 2. ", " ", " If you listen to their stump speeches in full, Sanders and Trump are often the gloomiest candidates running for president, at times ignoring the technological, racial and economic progress of the last 30 years. ", " But what voters here have digested are the headlines of those candidates' speeches. Trump can make America great, they say, repeating his central talking point. Sanders can make childcare, health care and college essentially free, as he promises. ", " When pressed on how unrealistic these ideas are, Trump supporters refer to his business experience, arguing no traditional politician is as sharp as Trump. Sanders backers argue traditional Democrats like Clinton aren't proposing ideas to make life better for the middle class, because they are too busy cozying up to the wealthy. ", " \"Affordable child care would have revolutionized my life,\" said 67-year-old Barbara Thompson of Davenport, who is backing Sanders. ", " She also noted that \"I like getting the money out of politics,\" another of Sanders' goals that is very unlikely to happen. ", " \"There's so much corruption. Trump doesn't need any of that, he doesn't need the special interests,\" said Chuck Michels, a 52-year-old carpenter supporting the real estate mogul. ", " 3. ", " ", " The Obama administration considers two of its biggest successes the Affordable Care Act and changes to college financial aid practices, such as increasing Pell Grants and streamlining the student loan process. ", " Voter after voter recited their struggles with high deductibles that left them wary of using their health insurance through Obamacare, and these were often Democrats who a minute earlier said President Obama had done an \"exceptional\" or \"phenomenal\" job as president. ", " \"He quit going to the doctor after the first couple of visits. Everything was going to be out of pocket, so he couldn't afford it,\" said Clemens, referring to her son, who is 35. ", " Her son's deductible is $6500 for his health insurance plan under the ACA, Clemens said. ", " Clemens said her son, who backed Obama in 2008, now \"feels like Obama let him down.\" ", " \"I told him this is not the bill that Obama wanted, it was what we could get done,\" she said. ", " Clemens, who is backing Clinton, added, \"I'm not entirely happy with Obamacare either.\" ", " \"If I got sick, I couldn't afford to use it,\" said 61-year-old Peggy Neavor, a supervisor at dry cleaner said of her health insurance, noting its high deductibles. ", " She backed Obama in 2008 and favored Sanders in this race. ", " 4. ", " ", " Pat Toppins has bachelor and master's degrees in philosophy, works in a white-collar job at a company that sells freight trucks and described how America is a \"nation of immigrants.\" ", " He is enthusiastically for Trump. ", " \"The majority of the presidents were told, 'here's what you're going to do\" by big-money interests, said Toppins. \"It's not like that for him.\" ", " \"I know you'll think I'm crazy, but my second choice is Bernie Sanders,\" said Toppins. \"We've had enough career politicians. I like what Bernie Sanders is saying, but how are we going to pay for it? He is talking about trillions of dollars.\" ", " 5. ", " ", " In interviews, Trump supporters drew a careful line. They were supportive of his ideas, like building a wall between the U.S. and Mexico and enacting a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country. ", " But they were voting for him despite his controversial rhetoric, not because of it. ", " \"I wish he would be more inclusive. He doesn't have to be politically correct, but he doesn't have to be politically incorrect either,\" said Toppins. ", " \"There are a few comments we could live without, but sometimes they are tongue-in-cheek,\" said Jim Finneran, a 54-year-old salesman at a company that distributes vending machines. \"I like his brashness.\" ", " \"The key word is temporary,\" Finneran said of Trump's Muslim ban. \"We need to make sure we know who is coming into the country right now.\" ", " 6. ", " ", " Clinton supporters, particularly the elderly ones, repeatedly said that Sanders was simply too old to be president. They couldn't imagine such a strenuous job at 74 years old and weren't sure how Sanders could either. ", " These comments were striking, if only because Sanders' age has not yet emerged as a major campaign issue. The 68-year-old Clinton is unlikely to attack her opponent for being old, but if Sanders won the primary, this could be fertile ground for the 69-year-old Donald Trump. ", " \"He's only two years younger than I am, and I'm too old,\" said 78-year-old Jim Lasso, a retired mechanic who saw Clinton speak in Davenport and favored the former secretary of state. ", " \"I think he's too old. He might be in good health, but you never know,\" said Rose Arrington, a 65-year-old artist who is backing Clinton. ", " 7. ", " ", " In interviews, Sanders backers listed candidates they previously supported. For nearly all, it was Howard Dean in 2004 and Barack Obama in 2008. They frequently referred to Clinton's Iraq War vote in 2002 as a reason to oppose her. ", " It's not entirely clear Clinton could have ever won over this bloc of voters. They are inclined towards the more liberal, anti-establishment candidate. This may point less to a flaw in Clinton's campaigning than a kind of permanent fissure in the Democratic Party ", " \"Hillary is politics as usual. She's for the corporations. The things she believes in, I don't believe in,\" said Cynthia Lomas, a 61-year-old African-American musician who is backing Sanders. (She was one of the few blacks at any of the candidate events in Eastern Iowa.) ", " \"She feels like a career politician who has nothing new to say,\" she added. ", " John Bowman, a 71-year-old attorney in Davenport, said of Sanders, \"Bernie voted against all of the wars. I'm a combat veteran. I want peace.\" ", " 8. ", " ", " At Clinton's Davenport event on Friday, hundreds of people waited in line outside in the cold to get spots near the front of the stage for her speech. They were excited to see Clinton and to vote for her. ", " But while Sanders and Trump supporters have very specific rationales for backing those two, Clinton supporters gave a wide variety of reasons to back her, ranging from Clinton's experience to electing the first female president to just being comfortable with her in the Oval Office. ", " \"I have been to two Bernie Sanders events. I see all the young people there,\" said Clemens. ", " \"Until a couple of days ago, I was 50-50. Now, I just feel right with Hillary.\" "]}

As the insurgent, Tea Party-backed candidate, he took a much more hardline stance. ", " Anti-illegal immigration activists were skeptical about the Republican candidate. They attended his campaign events to question him in an attempt to nail down where he stood, eventually prompting Rubio to agree to a meeting.

", " \"You can't grant amnesty either because if you do, you will destroy any hope of having a legal immigration system that works. You will send a message that all you have to do is come into this country, stay here long enough and we will let you stay,\" Rubio said at a campaign stop during that Senate race, according to the Miami Herald.

His explanations for his past stances often don't shed much light on the specifics of his position.

He says the border must be secure and that current laws must be enforced before the 11 million undocumented immigrants currently living in the U.S. can be addressed. Nothing can be done until \"illegal immigration is under control,\" Rubio has said. ", " While he doesn't often say it, he still supports a path to citizenship. In June when he was asked if he supported a path to citizenship, he said, \"I do.\" And in an interview on ", ", Rubio said he supports citizenship at the end of a long, complicated process that could take an immigrant more than ten years to navigate. ", " Instead of being specific when he does talk about the 11 million undocumented immigrants, Rubio uses a loaded term that appeals to many in the Republican base. He recently started saying on the campaign trail that he's \"not going to support amnesty,\" like he did at a Burlington, Iowa town hall Monday.

The first survey asked respondents over 50 questions; our analysis found that 16 of those questions were most effective in segmenting out 10 cohorts that make up the American electorate.

Here's what each category says about its members, generally: ", " An anchor for the GOP, Rock-Solid Republicans are mostly married, mostly living in the South, and 1 in 4 are seniors. Holding consistently conservative views on fiscal and social issues, the group nearly universally disapproves of President Obama, thinks the Supreme Court is too liberal, and overwhelmingly says the country is headed in the wrong direction. Few Rock-Solids live in the city, nor do they want to, preferring a small town or rural place to call home, with lots of space and privacy and people around who share similar religious beliefs. They are football fans and pickup-truck drivers. Their favorite holidays are Christmas and the Fourth of July. ", " Rock-Solids are a very homogenous group, largely white and Christian, with about half attending church once a week. They're somewhat politically engaged, with a third posting political views online and nearly as many displaying political bumper stickers. ", " Somewhat younger than the Rock-Solid Republicans, Blue-Collar Conservatives tend to live in rural and small-town settings where they can be near good schools and outdoor activities like hiking and fishing. Most display the American flag and keep a gun in the house - but this group drives SUVs more than pickups. Few are politically engaged - showing instead a preference for church and community activities such as youth groups and volunteer work. ", " Men and women are nearly equally represented here, compared to all other Republican groups, which skew male. Their favorite holidays are Christmas and Thanksgiving, and many like watching NASCAR. ", " This group sees problems where other conservatives don't; they are divided 45% to 54% on whether it's just a few people at the top who are able to get ahead in today's economy or if everyone has a fair chance. Nearly half prefer government regulation of business to protect the public interest, by far the highest level among the Republican groups. They're struggling to stay in the middle class in an economy that increasingly favors the educated: 4 in 10 have just a high school degree or less, and about half have household incomes under $75,000. A third are in jobs that require some physical labor, and most prefer a protectionist stance on free trade. ", " Young and mostly urban, this group identifies with many conservative ideologies, but tends to resemble liberals in their lifestyle choices and preferences. They are the least likely Republican group to display an American flag or to have a gun at home. They like city living. They care less about access to outdoor activities, and more about being near art museums or cultural activities, public transportation, and being able to walk to where they want to go. They are one of the most diverse conservative groups, with about 3 in 10 being non-white. Among the Republican cohorts, they are the least likely to attend church weekly, and the most college-educated. ", " Urban Cowboys say the U.S. should take a leading role in solving international conflicts. They are the most likely Republican group to support free trade over protecting American industries by limiting imports. They're somewhat divided on government's role, but lean conservative: about 7 in 10 say government regulation does more harm than good and a slim majority say the government should promote traditional values. Half say global warming is due to human causes. The group sees America as a land of fair opportunity, with 6 in 10 believing that most people have a chance to get ahead. They're divided on whether immigrants strengthen the country or are a burden. ", " Urban Cowboys are moderately engaged - they are more likely to attend a protest than other Republicans, but less likely to volunteer. They report the highest Republican rate of membership in sports leagues, but the lowest rate of belonging to a church or synagogue. ", " Those in the Don't Tread on Me group are more conservative than the average Republican on a number of issues. Overwhelmingly male, they are the cohort least likely to be found behind a desk at work, with more than a third saying their work involves light activity or manual labor. A majority own a gun personally and more than 8 in 10 display the American flag. Half identify as evangelical, and Christmas and Easter are their two favorite holidays. They are the most likely of all cohorts to have children under age 18, and largely prefer rural areas with access to outdoor activities. They're spread across most of the country, with fewer in the Northeast. ", " The Don't Tread on Me faction overwhelmingly believes government should promote traditional values and nearly three-quarters of them support the Tea Party movement. They are the only conservative cohort opposed to U.S. intervention in global conflicts. ", " An overwhelming majority (95%) think that government regulation of business does more harm than good. This group also has the most extreme views on immigration, with 86% seeing immigrants as a burden on American society. More politically involved than other conservative groups, they volunteer for campaigns and attend protests or political rallies at higher rates. Nearly 7 in 10 have posted political views online and 6 in 10 have displayed a bumper sticker or lawn sign. ", " Apoliticals sit on the sidelines of American politics. Nearly three-quarters say they haven't engaged in political activities in the last three years. Their opinion is split on government's role in society, as well as on immigration. Somewhat more disapprove of the job Barack Obama is doing as president than approve, 57% to 44%. And reflecting their bystander viewpoint at the international level, two-thirds, say the United States should not try to solve international conflicts. ", " Apoliticals take sitting on the sidelines seriously: six in ten said they had not participated in any of a list of common activities like volunteering or attending community meetings. About the same number did not belong to any of the social or community groups listed. About a third are unaffiliated with any religious organization or identify as atheist or agnostic. They are younger, tend to be less educated, and inclined to live in rural and small town settings.

Their lack of commitment to either party reflects a genuine uncertainty\u2014or ideological views that do not align with either group. True independents, their attitudes divide on a number of issues, including how Barack Obama is handling his job. They're split on government regulation and whether the fight against terrorism went too far in infringing on individuals' privacy. They lean towards government not imposing conservative values on society. More of these toss-up voters say immigrants today strengthen the country, but a majority also say that blacks are personally responsible for getting ahead in society. ", " Free Agents have one of the highest self-reported rates of volunteerism across the cohorts, are church-goers, and are active in local issues. They also tend to be more educated than the Apoliticals, with half having at least some college. They are more likely to be white and 3 in 10 are evangelical. Free Agents have a slight preference for small town life, but you'll find them across all metropolitan settings. They are the most likely cohort to belong to a sports league. ", " Free-Range Dems are joiners and rabble rousers. Nearly 4 in 10 have attended an organized protest - more than twice as many as any other group. Their approval of Barack Obama is more muted than other Democrats - likely because he has not gone far enough to satisfy them. ", " They support government regulation, perceive an opportunity gap in this country for all but the richest, overwhelmingly say that racial discrimination is at the heart of what is keeping blacks from getting ahead, and agree that climate change is the result of human activities. They are the cohort most opposed to the United States entering international conflicts. A majority say the government's efforts in the war on terror have infringed on individuals' privacy, more so than other Democratic groups, and they overwhelmingly don't trust government or business with their personal data. ", " A majority of Free-Range Dems report volunteering and working to influence government action through a non-political group. While half are city dwellers, many want access to outdoor activities. They're the group most likely to own a compact car and most likely to get their vegetables from a farmers' market or community-sponsored agriculture (CSA) organization. ", " Highly educated, Free-Range Dems are the whitest of the left-leaning groups. While most other liberal groups have more females than males proportionally, this group splits evenly. Nearly half are atheist or agnostic or don't identify with any particular religion. While this group skews younger, about 1 in 5 are over the age of 65, making them look a lot like hipsters and hippies who reject the brand label \"Democrat.\" ", " Dems the Blues are one of the least affluent groups and report the lowest education level - just 12% have a college degree or higher. They're more pessimistic about the country's direction and give Barack Obama lower approval ratings than other Democratic groups. ", " Nearly twice as likely to display an American flag as other liberal groups (65%), Dems the Blues are also much more likely to have a gun in the home (53%). Nearly 3 in 10 come from labor union households, and more than 1 in 5 have jobs that entail light activity to heavy labor. A third have school-age children. Socially more conservative, about 4 in 10 identify as evangelical and go to church weekly--more than any other Democratic group. About 6 in 10 say that the government should promote traditional values. ", " This group is also more divided on the issue of government regulation than most liberal groups; 56% say that government regulation of business is necessary while 42% say that government regulation of business does more harm than good. Dems the Blues are not very politically engaged, but likely to be involved in community or church activities. Less urban and more suburban or rural, a plurality live in the South, and 4 in 10 identify as black, Hispanic or another race or ethnicity. ", " True Blues are mainstream Democrats -- decidedly left of center among all Americans, but more moderate than those furthest to the left. They divide on whether the government should promote traditional values. A plurality say the government's surveillance program is balanced between fighting terrorism and protecting individuals' privacy. Approval of Barack Obama runs high, but is not as universally shared. A mostly urban group, few are likely to display an American flag (33%) and the least likely to have a gun in the home (20%). They are somewhat less politically or socially engaged, although a quarter attend church once a week.

Not surprisingly, they are keen on living near people from different racial and ethnic backgrounds and are the group most likely to want to live in a community with a mix of housing for people with different economic backgrounds. Nearly two-thirds see immigrants as a positive for the country. They have the highest number of basketball devoteess, but also follow football and baseball. ", " Progressive Progressives are unified on a number of Democratic dogmas: 97% say government regulation of business is necessary to protect public interests; 97% say immigrants today strengthen our country; 96% say climate change is caused by human activities. Large majorities perceive the existence of income inequality and say that racial discrimination is at the root of why many blacks can't get ahead in this country. Barack Obama's approval rating is sky high among this group and they are the most likely to say the country is headed in the right direction.

They're highly engaged, both politically and within their communities - but only about 1 in 4 belongs to a church or place of worship.

", " The brief suspension of the campaign's access to the Democratic National Committee's voter database system could have threatened Sanders' goal of turning out new caucus goers as well.

", " Rynard, who worked as a staffer for Clinton in 2008 but has not endorsed a candidate this cycle, explained that for a grassroots campaign like Sanders', losing access to the DNC's system would \"ground your campaign to a halt\" especially since his campaign \"has had to reach out to so many new people.\" ", " With fewer than 50 days left until the caucuses, Sanders has said he intends to come to Iowa more, as he has lagged behind his competitors in terms of visits to the state over the past two months.

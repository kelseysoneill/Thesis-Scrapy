So we decided to talk to the those with nothing left to lose:</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the ones who had already lost. </span></p>", "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each week, we go one-on-one with a politician who came up short on election night -- from former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean (D) to former Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.); from former Texas state Senator Wendy Davis (D)\u00a0to former Minnesota Gov.\u00a0Tim Pawlenty (R). We interviewed the famous, the not-so-famous and the Internet infamous on what it\u2019s really like to fundraise in the era of Citizens United, to lose by four votes, to run as a black Republican or to be mocked for a Newsweek cover.</span></p>", "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You might laugh.

Still, the contest tends to give the winning candidate some momentum. Obama took that Iowa win in '08 and ran with it.</p>", "<p>And, yes, Clinton has made primary history before. In 2008, she narrowly defeated Obama to <a href=\"http://politics.nytimes.com/election-guide/2008/results/votes/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">win the New Hampshire primary</a>, and she took a bunch of other states, too.</p>", "<p>Clinton is a contentious figure, even among women.

Rubio finished third. </span></p>", "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The news runs on surprise. People click on stories that surprise them. Things that are expected to happen -- like Trump and Cruz fighting it out for first place in Iowa -- are less surprising. Politicians know this and take advantage of it. Politicos call this the \"expectations game\" -- setting expectations of your performance at a certain level so that you can do \"better than expected\" and be the focus of the headlines.</span></p>", "<p>The spin is already happening. \"This is the moment they told us would never happen,\" Rubio said Monday night. \"They told me we had no chance.\" His campaign manager, Alex Conant, struck a similar tune. \"This is a big night for us,\" Conant said. \"It's probably a three-person race leaving here. If you don't want Trump or Cruz to be the nominee, you better get on board with Marco Rubio.\"</p>", "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reporters know they're being spun, but they go with it anyway. \"It'll annoy Rubio detractors that his expectations management game worked, he overperformed, and it\u2019ll have an impact in his coverage,\" Commentary's Noah Rothman </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/NoahCRothman/status/694343246261141504\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tweeted</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Friday.

Here's a great guide to how you should really think about the results:</span>\u00a0</p>", "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The real story here is that more than half of Republican primary voters in Iowa opted for Trump -- a blowhard billionaire who has embraced open racism and is tearing the GOP apart -- and Cruz, the most loathed man in Washington. Nearly 10 percent of them voted for Ben Carson, a neurosurgeon who has never held federal political office. </span></p>", "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The pro-Rubio narrative will be that, as the \"establishment\" candidate who did best in Iowa, he is well-positioned to gather the full strength of the Republican establishment behind him. But Monday night's results showed just how weak that establishment is: With 99 percent of the results in, Cruz, Trump and Carson, the candidates most often described as anti-establishment, took a combined 61 percent of the vote. Everyone else combined for 39 percent.</span></p>", "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The results also showed the weakness of \"establishment\" as a label. While it does describe candidates' closeness to party elites, it doesn't tell voters much about their policy positions. Trump says racist things. But like Trump, Rubio holds several positions that are well outside the mainstream of American political opinion. He believes, for example, that women who are raped and become pregnant <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/oct/25/jennifer-granholm/liberal-pundit-marco-rubio-opposes-rape-incest-abo/\" target=\"_blank\">should have to</a>\u00a0carry the pregnancy to term.

There's more: </span></p>", "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rubio could very well be the Republican nominee. He will likely be able to sign up more major donors and score a few endorsements by citing his Iowa results. And he'll have at least one fewer opponent to worry about: Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas, suspended his campaign Monday night. But Rubio's performance in Iowa doesn't mean he won anything. It just means he still has a chance.\u00a0</span></p>"], "article_preview": ["Third place is the second loser."], "article_author": ["Nick Baumann"]}

She won a strong majority of women, union members, and minority voters \u2013 all critical towards winning the Democratic nomination. Hillary also won among voters who listed economy/jobs, health care or terrorism as their most important issue.\n</p>", "<p itemprop=\"articleBody\">\nPrior to the caucus, the Sanders campaign had said that they would win if turnout was north of 170,000. Well, turnout was north of 170,000 and Hillary Clinton won.\n</p>", "<p itemprop=\"articleBody\">\nMany leading commentators called the night for what it was: a win for Hillary Clinton and setback for Bernie Sanders. One MSNBC commentator called the victory a \u201clegit boost\u201d for Clinton\u2019s campaign, while The Hill wrote that \u201cClinton leaves Iowa with her standing intact as the clear favorite to win the Democratic nomination.\u201d Meanwhile, the New York Times wrote that Sanders \u201cfailed to win a state tailor made to his strengths\u201d and CBS News\u2019 Senior Political Editor said Sanders \u201creally needed to win here.\n</p>", "<p itemprop=\"articleBody\">\n<strong>Why Sanders Needed a Big Win in Iowa:</strong>\n</p>", "<p itemprop=\"articleBody\">\nThe reality is that Sanders needed a decisive victory in Iowa in order to have a viable path to the nomination. His own campaign said repeatedly that Sanders needed to win in Iowa, which based on demographics and ideology, should have been one of his strongest states. The Huffington Post\u2019s Sam Stein broke it down on MSNBC this morning, saying:\n\"It was an incredibly white electorate. Ideologically and demographically, in short, it lined up with Bernie \u2026. You have to look at the delegate math and wonder, okay, after New Hampshire where does it happen, where does the next state take place? I\u2019m not sure even his people know that answer yet.\u201d [MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe, 2/2/16]\n</p>", "<p itemprop=\"articleBody\">\n<strong>The Path Forward:</strong>\n</p>", "<p itemprop=\"articleBody\">\nFollowing Hillary Clinton\u2019s successful night in Iowa, she\u2019s excited to take the fight to New Hampshire, Nevada, South Carolina and beyond.\n</p>", "<p itemprop=\"articleBody\">\nNew Hampshire is Bernie Sanders\u2019 backyard. Vermont shares a media market with New Hampshire, and the voters of New Hampshire have a history of supporting candidates from New England. So it\u2019s not surprising that Sanders maintains a double-digit lead in the polls there. Despite those built-in advantages for Sanders, Hillary Clinton will do what she always does \u2013 fight her heart out for every single vote. And after New Hampshire, the race becomes considerably more challenging for Bernie Sanders as the contest moves to Nevada and South Carolina, states with electorates that strongly favor Hillary. As the University of Virginia\u2019s Larry Sabato wrote:\n\"Even if Sanders wins New Hampshire, as currently expected, Clinton can just write off his victory as a result of regionalism. (Sanders is from neighboring Vermont, and New Hampshire has repeatedly backed candidates in both parties from the Northeast.) As the contest moves to the more diverse states of Nevada and South Carolina, the territory will be friendlier to Clinton.\u201d [Larry Sabato, Crystal Ball, 2/2/16]\nWhile we expect the polls in Nevada and South Carolina to tighten, we believe Hillary is in a strong position to win. Our campaign has been organizing volunteers, building leadership teams, recruiting precinct captains and holding grassroots events for months.\n</p>", "<p itemprop=\"articleBody\">\n<strong>Preparing for March:</strong>\n</p>", "<p itemprop=\"articleBody\">\nIt\u2019s important to remember that while the first four states receive a lot of attention, they only represent 4% of the delegates needed to win the nomination. The states with primaries and caucuses in March represent 56% of the delegates needed to win the nomination, with nearly half of those delegates awarded on Super Tuesday alone. Seven of the 11 Super Tuesday states have large minority populations \u2013 including Alabama, Georgia and Texas, which are expected to see majority-minority turnouts.\n</p>", "<p itemprop=\"articleBody\">\nAccording to an ABC News-Washington Post poll, Hillary holds a 67-28 lead over Sanders among non-white voters nationally. But the campaign takes absolutely nothing for granted. We have staff on the ground in all of the Super Tuesday states and have built leadership councils in each state, where community leaders are working tirelessly to cultivate support. Early Vote turnout efforts are already underway and Hillary has aggressively been taking her message directly to voters in key states with town hall events and local radio/television interviews.\n</p>", "<p itemprop=\"articleBody\">\nFrom day one, we\u2019ve said that we expect this primary to be competitive. Running for president isn\u2019t supposed to be easy. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve built a national organization designed to secure the delegates needed to win the Democratic nomination.

But he made a strong run at Trump for second place, an unimaginable result even a week ago. As important for Rubio, he was the top GOP candidate among people who made up their minds in the past week. That strong closing kick positions Rubio well for the next eight-day sprint between Iowa and New Hampshire\u00a0\u2014 particularly given Trump's disappointing showing, which could well bring the real estate mogul's numbers in the Granite State back down to earth.

Then a spate of stories about the finances of the Clinton Foundation and her six-figure speaking fees. Then came the news that Vice President Biden was considering a late entry into the race \u2014 in part because some Democrats worried that Clinton was starting to look like a weak general-election candidate.", " ", "In October, it was coming to a head, with the added tests of the first Democratic debate and her grilling before the House Select Committee on Benghazi. ", " ", "The day before she was to testify, Clinton and her aides were holding a prep session at her dining room table in Washington when communications direction Jennifer Palmieri got a text message telling her to turn on CNN.", " ", "Biden was heading for the Rose Garden, with President Obama in tow. That choice of venue could mean only one thing, they knew: Biden was not running.", " ", "One crisis was averted. But another one was brewing. While the Benghazi hearing was a chance for Clinton to shine while fending off attacks from political enemies, aides knew that any mistake or gaffe could prompt more doubts about her strength. ", " ", "The next morning, as Clinton was preparing to leave home for Capitol Hill, she got a jarring call from longtime aide Cheryl Mills. With just an hour to go before the start of the hearing, the Republicans had just dropped a binder full of hundreds of documents they intended to use in their questioning \u2014 documents that Clinton had not prepared for. ", " ", "Among them, Clinton aides say, was an email she had sent to her daughter, Chelsea, on the night of the attacks in which the secretary blamed \u201can Al Q[a]eda-like group.\u201d GOP lawmakers saw it as a smoking gun, evidence that the Obama administration knew the attack had been terrorism even though officials initially said the incident had been sparked by an anti-Muslim video.", " ", "But Clinton lawyer David Kendall had negotiated to prevent something that could have been more damaging. They feared that committee Republicans would have Clinton raise her right hand and be sworn in at the opening of the hearing, which would have produced an image that would be a GOP admaker\u2019s dream. Instead, she signed an oath before the hearing started.", " ", "A spokesman for the House committee said the leadership offered Clinton the chance to be sworn in privately to avoid a political spectacle. In addition, said the spokesman, Jamal Ware, the committee does not typically give witnesses advance information but provided the additional documents to Clinton as a result of negotiations with Kendall. Because Clinton had decided which emails to disclose, Ware said, her surprise reflected a \u201cfailure on the Clinton team\u2019s part to prepare her with the materials they knew they had turned over to the committee.\u201d", " ", "Clinton emerged from October with her poll numbers on an upward swing. Meanwhile, Mook was preparing for the long game. He had already moved organizers into Colorado and Minnesota, which like Iowa are caucus states, set to hold their contests on March 1. In other words, they were just the kind of place where a political movement like the one that Sanders had ignited could run up the delegate score.", " ", "As voting day in Iowa drew near, former president Bill Clinton hit the trail for his wife, calling Mook frequently to ask him questions and advice. He urged the campaign to focus more on her biography \u2014 which it has.", " ", "\u201cHave we told people about how she reformed the educational system in Arkansas?\u201d Bill Clinton would say, according to Mook. \u201cHave we told people about the pre-K work she did? Have we told people about the Children\u2019s Defense Fund?\u201d", " ", "Mook added of the former president: \u201cHe\u2019s also a junkie. He just likes to talk shop.\u201d", " ", "\u2018The surprise campaign\u2019", " ", "Sanders recruited a trusted former aide, Jeff Weaver, to be his campaign manager.", " ", "Weaver had left as Sanders\u2019s chief of staff to open a comic book and gaming store in 2009. He had been reluctant to be drawn back into politics, especially for a quixotic venture, but Sanders convinced him it was not. \u201cIt became clear to me from the beginning that he was running to win,\u201d Weaver said. \u201cThis was not just a speaking tour.\u201d", " ", "Sanders also made clear what kind of organization he wanted.", " ", "\u201cIt had to be a modern campaign, with all the modern tools of running, without becoming a corporatized environment,\u201d Weaver said.", " ", "The money came quickly. Devine had told Sanders that he had to raise at least $40\u00a0million \u2014 and preferably $50\u00a0million \u2014 if he wanted to be competitive by the Iowa caucuses. By the end of last year, they had raised $73\u00a0million. In January, an additional $20\u00a0million poured in, almost all of it from contributions that averaged about $27.", " ", "That was enough for Sanders to put an additional 139 organizers in Iowa in January, more than doubling the total the campaign was saying publicly. As the political world focused throughout the summer on the gains Sanders was making against Clinton in New Hampshire, his campaign was building an Iowa operation earlier, and with more resources, than was generally recognized ", " ", "Weaver called it \u201cthe other campaign .\u2009.\u2009. the surprise campaign.\u201d", " ", "Sanders\u2019s first Iowa rally, which was in late May in Davenport, drew 700 people \u2014 the largest Iowa crowd any candidate had seen at that point. Volunteers were stationed there an hour and a half early to collect information about the attendees.", " ", "Typically at that early stage, voters are just starting to shop around for a candidate. But to the surprise of the embryonic Sanders campaign, one-third of those who attended that rally arrived ready to sign up as committed to the candidate.", " ", "\u2018There was this organic thing happening,\u201d said Pete D\u2019Alessandro, the Iowa director. \u201cThat\u2019s where Senator Sanders knew it from the beginning. His message \u2014 this was something people were waiting to rally behind.\u201d", " ", "Although there was no doubt about the enthusiasm, marshalling it into 1,681 precinct caucuses presented a challenge. ", " ", "The campaign estimated that as many as 40\u00a0percent of the supporters it identified had never been to a caucus before. At meetings of his precinct captains, D\u2019Alessandro would ask which of them would be attending their first; sometimes, half the people in the room would raise their hands. And then there was the occasional volunteer who would tell him: \u201cYeah, I haven\u2019t done this since McGovern,\u201d referring to the Democrat who ran in 1972.", " ", "The campaign made an intense effort to train organizers and volunteers on how to canvass and phone-bank. Staffers sent out regular math exercises for them to do over the instant-messaging system Slack, to make sure they understood the calculations they would have to make under the arcane rules on caucus night. ", " ", "Sanders\u2019s operation tried to seize on opportunities presented by the unlikely sensation that the gruff 74-year-old senator was creating among young voters. Organizers got a list of 25,000 high school seniors to target, aware that anyone who would be 18 or older in November is eligible to caucus.", " ", "In the tiny hamlet of Underwood outside Council Bluffs, the campaign signed up 35 12th graders \u2014 potentially enough to tip the balance on caucus night in a town of only 932 people.", " ", "All of it was a bet on turnout. By the day before the caucuses, the campaign\u2019s internal models showed that it would take 170,000 or more, second only to the record 240,000 that showed up in 2008, for Sanders to win. ", " ", "\u201cThe thing that keeps me up at night \u2014 What if we are wrong? What if everyone\u2019s right, and these people have just been coming to rallies?\u201d D\u2019Alessandro said as he headed into the final weekend. ", " ", "For most of the early months, Sanders continued to shun many of the trappings of a big-league political campaign. He did not hire a pollster or set up a voter modeling operation until October.", " ", "In retrospect, his campaign manager, Weaver, said, \u201cIf I had known the money would be there, I would have scaled up bigger earlier.\u201d", " ", "There were rough patches that showed how hard it was to go from running for office in a small, ethnically homogeneous state to a national campaign. Sanders seemed to be taken off balance when Black Lives Matter protesters began showing up at his events. And pundits wondered whether he had blundered at the first debate when the biggest controversy surrounding Clinton came up and he declared, \u201cThe American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails!\u201d", " ", "But the fact that whether he could beat Clinton in Iowa was even a question became an accomplishment in itself, given how far back Sanders had started.", " ", "And now, a party that expected a coronation is settling in for a marathon.

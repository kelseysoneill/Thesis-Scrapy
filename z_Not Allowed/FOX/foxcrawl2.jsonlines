But it also is a state filled with people who are willing to pay attention, to go to small events and forums (more than 1,500 have been held) and to show up at a caucus on a cold, often snowy night to participate in a ritual few states duplicate.</p>", "<p>Millions of dollars are spent on TV commercials (over 60,000) and organization that\u00a0Monday night produced a record turnout.</p>", "<p>Iowa doesn't always produce the eventual winners but it does eliminate the losers. With 17 Republican candidates starting this process, there are really only three or four real candidates now with voter support and sufficient monies to go on to the remaining contests.</p>", "<p>With a record voter turnout in Iowa, the winner, Ted Cruz goes on with his extraordinary organization and conservative supporters with a big upset.</p>", "<p>Marco Rubio, the best debater, came on strong and gained real momentum. He came very close to coming in second. Certainly he has to be viewed as a very serious candidate and the best bet to become the establishment candidate.</p>", "<p>Trump is Trump and his special appeal to new voters and the angry anti-Washington element will go on, too, but with unpredictable results. He also paid a price for missing the last debate and fighting Fox News.</p>", "<p>Ben Carson held his 10 percent base, but his candidacy is short lived and beyond Iowa has minimal support.</p>", "<p>The biggest losers are Bush, Christie and Huckabee. Bush spent the most money and dropped like a rock. </p>", "<p>Christie's bluster, unlike Trump\u2019s, didn't sell. He has no money and no future in this race. </p>", "<p>And Huckabee, who won this race eight years, and thought he could be a serious challenger against Romney in 2012, was a bottom dweller getting less than 2 percent of the vote. He raised no money and has no appeal and barely has enough money left to buy a bus ticket back to Arkansas. He quickly waved the flag of surrender and wisely quit the race.</p>", "<p>One more may make the cut after Iowa, but this is the field now and it will be fascinating to watch.</p>", "<p>Monday night\u2019s win is a giant victory for Cruz and his team. He won in spite of a greater turnout than in years past and benefited from the dramatic increase in new voters. And now on to New Hampshire!<br> </p>", "<p><i>Edward J.

Republican officials said there were more than 180,000 people at Monday's GOP caucuses, up from the previous high of about 121,000 in 2012. The Iowa Democratic Party said their caucuses drew 171,109 supporters, well short of the record 240,000 caucus-goers in 2008.</p>", "<p>Several caucus sites remained open longer to accommodate long lines; some even ran out of registration forms or ballots.</p>", "<p>Cruz rose from the middle of the Republican pack last year to overtake Trump on Monday. His victory disrupts Trump's front-runner narrative and could jolt the GOP race, where candidates have struggled for months to arrest Trump\u2019s rise.\u00a0</p>", "<p>According to\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/elections/2016/primary-caucus-results/iowa\">entrance polling</a>\u00a0of Republican caucus-goers conducted by Fox News, Cruz won by garnering the support of evangelical Christians and those who wanted a candidate who shares their values. Evangelical Christians made up 62 percent of Republican caucus-goers \u2014 up from 56 percent in 2012 \u2014 and of those, 33 percent backed the Texas senator.\u00a0</p>", "<p>On the Democratic side, Sanders overwhelmed Clinton among caucus-goers under 30, a group that he won 84 percent to 14 percent. However, that constituency only made up 18 percent of all Democratic caucus-goers.\u00a0</p>", "<p>On the other hand, 55 percent of all Democratic caucus-goers said they wanted the next president to continue President Obama's policies. Clinton won the support of 68 percent of that constituency.</p>", "<p>The Iowa caucuses have had a mixed record in recent cycles, particularly on the Republican side, in picking the eventual nominees.\u00a0</p>", "<p>The GOP caucus winners in 2008 and 2012 were Huckabee and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, respectively, neither of whom won the nomination.</p>", "<p>Eight years ago, though, Obama\u2019s Iowa win helped set him on the trajectory to claim first the Democratic nomination, then the presidency.</p>", "<p><i>Fox News\u2019 Ed Henry and Jake Gibson and The Associated Press contributed to this report.</i></p>"]}

He said their political team had forwarded an initial news report that said Carson was taking a break from the campaign trail, but did not forward an update to that same story.</p>", "<p>\u201cUnfortunately, they did not then forward the subsequent story, that was Ben\u2019s campaign clarifying that he was continuing the campaign and was not canceling the campaign,\u201d Cruz said.\u00a0\u201cAnd so I apologize to Ben for that. They should have forwarded that subsequent story. That was a mistake on our part.\u201d</p>", "<p>Carson's campaign issued a statement Tuesday evening saying he \"accepted\" Cruz's apology.</p>", "<p>On Tuesday morning, Cruz spokesman Rick Tyler also told MSNBC that the campaign simply repeated what Carson had said: that after Iowa, he was returning to Florida for a couple of days, then going to Washington for the National Prayer Breakfast.</p>", "<p>\u201cThat told us he was not going to New Hampshire,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cThat was not a dirty trick.\u201d\u00a0</p>", "<p>Carson, interviewed earlier on \u201cFox &amp; Friends,\u201d said that his supporters were told Monday that \u201cvoting for me was wasting their vote, and that they should reconsider.\u201d</p>", "<p>Carson ended up finishing a distant fourth in Iowa, with 9 percent, while Cruz claimed a big victory over Donald Trump. Cruz, a Texas senator, had 28 percent, and Trump had 24 percent. How much the drop-out rumors may have affected that count is unclear. But the interactive caucus process does offer an opportunity for supporters of one candidate to be persuaded to change sides before casting their ballot.</p>", "<p>The usually mild-mannered Carson accused the other side of using the process to execute \u201cdirty tricks.\u201d</p>", "<p>\u201cIt\u2019s the exact thing the American people are tired of,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy would we want to continue with this kind of shenanigans?\u201d</p>", "<p>He said his suspicions were also confirmed by tweets, \u201cother correspondence,\u201d and a first-hand experience by his wife at a precinct.</p>", "<p>Carson said his wife Candy arrived at the precinct to learn that a Cruz supporter was \u201cdisseminating\u201d the misinformation and was asked to set straight the record.</p>", "<p>\u201cShe did, and we won that precinct,\u201d he said.</p>", "<p>One of the tweets, Carson noted, came from Rep.

After what happened in 2008, the Clinton campaign wouldn\u2019t take anything for granted \u2013 even a 74-year old Democratic socialist.</p>", "<p>Monday night\u2019s results show just how much momentum Sanders has built.

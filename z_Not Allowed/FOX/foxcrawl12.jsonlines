My older brother died from a prescription drug, basically, an overdose \u2013 his body gave out from all the prescription drugs he was doing,\u201d director Chris Bell told FoxNews.com\u2019s Dr. Manny Alvarez. \u201cI wanted to find some answers why that happened to him.\u201d</p>", "<p>In the follow-up to his last documentary, \u201cBigger, Stronger, Faster,\u201d which examined the role of anabolic steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs in sports and the lengths some athletes will go to in order to reach their dreams, Bell takes viewers inside the world of prescription drug abuse through the stories of several addicts from all walks of life.

In 2010, enough prescription painkillers were prescribed to medicate every American adult every four hours for a month, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.</p>", "<p>\u201cI think the biggest eye-opener was I always thought that like prescription drugs \u2026 were in the business of health and healing, and they wanted to get you better,\u201d said Bell. \u201cAnd I just realized that \u2026 people benefit and there\u2019s a lot of money being made off of keeping people on drugs.\u201d</p>", "<p>It\u2019s no secret the pharmaceutical industry rakes in billions of dollars producing drugs to treat symptoms and manage medical conditions. In fact, over the past decade, the Big Pharma raked in $711 billion.

At the forum Governors Chris Christie, Jeb Bush, John Kasich, and CEO Carly Fiorina shared personal stories that can help tear down the old stigmas of the \u201cjunkie\u201d and the \"addict\" and allow us to effectively address this growing epidemic that touches almost every American.</p>", "<p>When presidential candidates share their own stories of family and friends battling addiction, it makes it safer for all of us to do the same. If a governor, a CEO, a presidential candidate has family battling addiction, it may feel safer to bring our own families\u2019 struggles with substance abuse out from the shadows.\u00a0</p>", "<p>As Governor Christie explained during the New Hampshire Forum on Addiction, \u201cYou don\u2019t go to a neighborhood dinner party and say, \u201cHey, my daughter is addicted to heroin. What\u2019s new with you? But if she had cancer you would tell them.\u201d</p>", "<p>He\u2019s right. When a family struggles with addiction, where are the offers for help, the casserole dishes, the apple pies, note cards and community support you find when other challenges and tragedies strike our neighbors?</p>", "<p>I believe this month\u2019s forum can be part of a shift that reinforces that we all are affected by addiction in some way. With 22.7 million people in need of treatment and another 23 million in recovery, too many of our families are touched by the heartbreak of addiction. </p>", "<p>As Governor John Kasich remarked, \u201cThis disease knows no bounds, knows no income, knows no neighborhood, it's everywhere.\u201d</p>", "<p>Governor Jeb Bush opened up about his daughter\u2019s struggle with prescription drugs and remarked on the need to address stigma. \u201cWe need to eliminate the stigma and the barriers so more and more people get engaged with this. Where they are not embarrassed to say I have an illness and I\u2019m on the road to recovery.\u201d</p>", "<p>Carly Fiorina's stepdaughter died of a drug overdose in 2009.\u00a0She shared her family\u2019s painful story and the need to better treat addiction. \u201cUnfortunately, too many of the men and women I have met on the campaign trail have experienced tragedies like ours. This is a battle that we must fight. There are things that we can and must do,\u201d she said.</p>", "<p>Stigma has contributed to the worsening epidemic we are seeing nationwide, particularly with heroin and prescription drugs. Shame drives this pervasive disease into the shadows where individuals and families have less support, less treatment, less resources and a whole lot of isolation.</p>", "<p>Imagine if it were shameful to have cancer or asthma in America. Or, disgraceful to seek chemotherapy. Stigma is a dark environment that makes it hard for us to address the disease. New CDC data tells us that 129 people are dying of drug overdoses in our country each day. That\u2019s equivalent to two commuter plane crashes every day for an entire year. If you factor in alcohol-related deaths, that shoots up to over 300 needless deaths every day.</p>", "<p>Let\u2019s all continue the honest conversation that the presidential candidates have started, in order to bring addiction \u2013 how our family and friends have been affected, and our own personal struggles \u2013 out into the light to fight this epidemic.</p>", "<p><i>Authors Note: \u00a0The Addiction Policy Forum invited all presidential candidates to the New Hampshire forum and eight were represented. In addition to the candidates mentioned, Governor Jim Gilmore and surrogates for Secretary Hillary Clinton and Governor Martin O\u2019Malley were in attendance. We will continue to press the other candidates to weigh in on these issues.</i></p>", "<p>Jessica Nickel is the executive director of The Addiction Policy Forum.

Six million of these were Jews.</p>", "<p>Re-visiting this hall of shame ought to at least give corporate and political bodies pause, when dealing with a regime that seems perfectly willing to finish the job Hitler and his brownshirts started.

About Siemens McFarlane writes: \"The company forced slaves to manufacture components for the rockets that ended up raining down on London and Antwerp, Belgium, in short order. In the early 21st century, Siemens began to pay reparations to the workers it had paid nary a pfennig to 55 years earlier.\"</p>", "<p>Will companies signing up to do business with Iran be shamed and perhaps forced by law at a future date to pay reparations to the families of those killed by Islamic terrorists funded by the Iranian regime?</p>", "<p>IG Farben was another company that dealt with Nazi Germany. The company licensed to various companies the pesticide Zyklon B, which was used to suffocate millions in the death camps. \"In 1951,\" notes McFarlane, \"when the victors partitioned Germany, the Western Allies restored IG Farben into its original components,\" which included BASF, maker of cassette tapes. \"Today, BASF continues to trade as one of the featured securities on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, with a market capitalization of $60 billion.\"</p>", "<p>A line from \"The Godfather\" seems an appropriate analogy. Just before someone is assassinated he is told, \"Nothing personal, it's strictly business.\"</p>", "<p>In a twist on this theme, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1998/08/01/news/01iht-gold.t.html\" target=\"_blank\">Deutsche Bank</a> in 1998 accepted \"moral responsibility\" for its dealings with the Nazis.

Thus the 2014 dip does not necessarily establish a trend.</p>", "<p>Moreover, argues Paula Donovan, co-director of AIDS-Free World, the organization that made public in March the highly critical U.N. experts report on sexual abuse, one of the many loopholes in the U.N.\u2019s statistical catalogue is that one allegation does not always mean one person committing one offense.</p>", "<p>\u201cAn allegation is simply a report,\u201d she says. \u201cIt could include ten perpetrators or ten victims.\u201d U.N. data, she told a press conference last week, where she and a small array of present and former U.N. dignitaries announced the launch of a campaign dubbed Code Blue, is \u201cmisleading\u201d and \u201cconfusing.\u201d</p>", "<p>Code Blue aims to strip legal immunity automatically from any U.N. official accused of sexual abuse or exploitation, in a bid to both speed up the course of justice and prevent evidence from disappearing in the long time it takes investigations to occur. The U.N. opposes the idea, arguing that immunity is rapidly removed from offenders\u00a0once a case against them is made, and the Code Blue proposal would amount to a violation of due process.</p>", "<p>In addition, the Code Blue campaign aims to have the U.N. establish another independent panel of experts \u201cto examine every facet of sexual exploitation and abuse in peacekeeping\u201d -- more or less what Ban says he has already done.</p>", "<p><i>George Russell is editor-at-large of Fox News and can be found on Twitter:\u00a0</i><a href=\"https://twitter.com/GeorgeRussell\" target=\"_blank\"><i>@GeorgeRussell</i></a><i>\u00a0or on\u00a0</i><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/george.russell\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Facebook.com/George Russell</i></a></p>", "<p>\u00a0</p>"]}

Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has suddenly scrambled to announce an \u201cexternal, independent review\u201d panel to examine that issue, along with \u201ca broad range of systemic issues related to how the U.N. responds to serious information of this kind.\u201d</p>", "<p>Ban, who declared himself \u201cdeeply disturbed\u201d by the situation, said on Wednesday his intent was \u201cto ensure that the United Nations does not fail the victims of sexual abuse, especially when committed by those who are meant to protect them.\u201d</p>", "<p>In fact, Fox News has learned, Ban\u2019s action was also urged on him two days earlier by U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Samantha Power, as U.N. member states dickered in committee over a resolution that criticized Ban for the \u201cperceived lack of timely information\u201d he had provided on the abuse issue and the \u201clack of protection of whistleblower\u201d associated with the CAR incidents.</p>", "<p>At the time of Ban\u2019s announcement, U.S. and European diplomats were still offering up alternative wordings in committee to temper the harsher language.</p>", "<p>Ban\u2019s spokesman, Stephane Dujarric, told Fox News that \u201cthe need to set up such a review has been in discussion for a long time,\u201d but the specific terms of reference of the inquiry and its membership were not revealed in Ban\u2019s announcement, though he did specify it would look into \u201cthe treatment of the specific report of abuse in the Central African Republic.\u201d \u00a0</p>", "<p>According to Dujarric, both the terms of reference and the membership of the probe will be revealed \u201cas soon as possible\u201d \u2013a fairly clear indication that Ban\u2019s sparse announcement was intended more as an initial fire-fighting gesture than a fully-planned response to the sex-abuse crisis. \u00a0</p>", "<p>Another way to look at it is that the U.N.\u2019s top bureaucrat was trying to keep the explosive sex abuse issue from spinning further out of control, amid a gout of document leaks, finger-pointing and U.N. investigations criticized as focused on hushing up leakers than on protecting additional young and starving children in the war-torn CAR from rape, sodomy and other predatory offenses.</p>", "<p>Moreover, the CAR controversy is only the latest crest in a swelling critique of the U.N.\u2019s ability to protect the innocent from sex abuse where its blue-and-white flag is flying\u2014a critique that includes a long-suppressed report of U.N.-appointed experts <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/world/2015/03/27/un-peacekeeping-and-rape-getting-betteror-worse/\">who have decried a \u201cculture of impunity\u201d</a> in U.N. peacekeeping missions when it comes to such crimes.\u00a0</p>", "<p>The latest controversy has been further fueled by U.N. document leaks that raised the possibility of retaliatory collusion by the organization\u2019s independent Ethics Officer; the head of its main independent internal watchdog, the Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS); the U.N.\u2019s High Commissioner for Human Rights; and Ban\u2019s top deputy against Anders Kompass, a senior U.N. human rights official who first brought the Central African Republic scandal into the daylight.</p>", "<p>That interpretation was strenuously denied by one senior U.N. official, who requested anonymity, while for her part, the U.N. \u00a0Ethics Officer, Joan Dubinsky, declined comment saying \u201cI don\u2019t believe it is appropriate to comment on leaked documents.\u201d</p>", "<p>U.N. spokesman Dujarric told Fox News that an investigation of Kompass by OIOS for \u201cpossible staff misconduct,\u201d initiated in March, would nonetheless continue in parallel with the still-unformed inquiry panel. \u201cAny relevant information of a broad systemic nature that will come out of that investigation will be considered by the review,\u201d he declared.</p>", "<p>Kompass has already been asked to resign at the behest of the U.N.\u2019s High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra\u2019ad Al Hussein. He refused.</p>", "<p>Kompass was then briefly suspended from his work\u2014until a U.N. tribunal reversed the action-- in conjunction with his investigation by OIOS for passing on transcripts by U.N.-collected testimony from children who described their sexual abuse and exploitation by French and African peacekeepers in the chaos-shattered CAR in 2013 and 2014. The children were aged from 9 to 13.</p>", "<p>The troops were from a multinational contingent that preceded the current U.N. peacekeeping mission in CAR\u2014the U.N. forces took over in September 2015-- but were operating with U.N. Security Council approval. \u00a0</p>", "<p>Kompass got the U.N. report on the childrens\u2019 testimony on July 15, 2014. He told a French diplomat about it roughly a week later, and in a written declaration has said he told his immediate superior in the U.N.\u2019s Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) about his disclosure \u201cshortly thereafter.\u201d</p>", "<p>Kompass has subsequently made no secret of the fact that he passed on the raw testimony to French military authorities by the end of that month, bypassing his own superiors, who said they discovered the action when French investigators approached the U.N. \u00a0It was more than eight months later that he was asked to resign.</p>", "<p>In a wave of claims and counter-claims, U.N. and French officials have each blamed the other for delays in investigating the allegations, but while the U.N. has claimed that it has cooperated fully, its interviewers only answered written questions from the French military probers.</p>", "<p>The investigative waters were roiled even further with the publication of internal emails and documents that showed top U.N. officials, including Ethics Office head Dubinsky, along with OIOS head Carman LaPointe, Zaid, and Ban\u2019s chef de cabinet, Susana Malcorra, grappling with how to cope with the Kompass actions.</p>", "<p>The documents were published by a non-government organization named AIDS-Free World, as part of a campaign called Code Blue. The campaign calls for an \u201centirely independent, external Commission of Inquiry, with full access to the U.N. as well as subpoena power, to examine every facet of sexual exploitation and abuse in peacekeeping operations\u201d and an automatic end to diplomatic immunity for any U.N. official or peacekeeper accused of such abuse.</p>", "<p>Among the documents were emails that summarized a meeting among the officials on the periphery of a March 19-20 Ban Ki-moon retreat in Turin, Italy, where they agreed to ask Kompass to \u201cdocument the sequence of events that he believed supported\u201d a claim to whistleblower status\u2014a designation that ultimately is made by the Ethics Officer, independently of other U.N. branches.</p>", "<p>Other emails document a dispute within OIOS over who would authorize Kompass\u2019 investigation\u2014a responsibility claimed by Lapointe personally.</p>", "<p>The documents also underline a profound confusion among the officials about what they were even supposed to be discussing\u2014for much of the conversation at least some of them believed they were discussing malfeasance in Mali.</p>", "<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.codebluecampaign.com/undocuments\">CLICK HERE FOR THE CODE BLUE DOCUMENTS.</a></p>", "<p>According to a senior U.N. official, the internal discussions about Kompass and his case were no more than a routine sorting-out of the responsibilities involved in dealing with an employee who had already admitted his actions while simultaneously claiming protected whistleblower status for them.</p>", "<p>In the U.N.\u2019s case, establishing that status often involves notification of the established chain of command of perceived wrongdoing before going elsewhere with the information, which Kompass did not do.</p>", "<p>At the same time, the official noted, OIOS\u2019 investigations division is a \u201cmess\u201d that is rife with dissention and back-biting, which made its proper functioning nearly impossible.</p>", "<p>For critics, however, the same documentation is proof that the ostensible independence of OIOS and the U.N. Ethics Office in investigating wrong-doing and protecting whistle-blowers is only a sham.</p>", "<p>\u201cThe Code Blue documents show that Malcorra and others at the most senior levels of the UN were entirely indifferent to the welfare of little boys as young as nine years old being subjected to the most egregious sexual abuse,\u201d \u00a0\u00a0argues Peter Gallo, a former OIOS investigator who left the organization in March.</p>", "<p>\u201cThe very essence of whistleblower protection is to protect staff members from retaliatory actions by management, but in the UN, it is now clear that the Ethics Office and management are on the same side.\u201d</p>", "<p>\u201cThere should be a solid wall between these people,\u201d Paula Donovan, co-founder of AIDS-Free World, told Fox News. \u201cThe regulations are very clear. They are supposed to be impartial.\u201d And when they were joined by Zaid\u2014Kompass\u2019 boss\u2014and his deputy \u201cthat was completely against the rules.\u201d</p>", "<p>Instead, she argued, the evidence points to the conclusion that they were \u201cinvestigating the best way\u201d to get rid of him.</p>", "<p>(Unrelated to the Code Blue documents, another U.N. official, Miranda Brown, who worked directly under Kompass and was aware of his decisions, has charged that she was forced out of her job by means of an unwanted transfer to Fiji the day before she was scheduled to talk with OIOS investigators.)</p>", "<p>The propriety of the meetings and emails concerning Kompass was also criticized by Robert Appleton, the former head of investigations for the U.N. \u00a0Procurement Task Force, a special anti-corruption unit within OIOS that existed between 2006 and 2009.</p>", "<p>The communications are \u201cdeeply troubling,\u201d Appleton, a highly-regarded former U.S. prosecutor, told Fox News. \u00a0\u201cTheir priorities appear to be quite skewed.\u201d</p>", "<p>Among other things, he said, during his tenure at OIOS, \u201cwe did not coordinate with the Ethics Office - -other than to recommend that they pursue whistleblower retaliation claims.\u201d</p>", "<p>In addition, \u201cOIOS is independent for a reason,\u201d Appleton asserted, \u201cin part so that the process not only is, but appears to be, fair, objective and free of bias and influence.</p>", "<p>\u201cInvestigations are conducted in confidence so as not to prejudice the process , prejudice the subject, or the outcome, and so as not to create a conflict with the administration that potentially needs to carry on with disciplinary processes following the investigation.\u201d</p>", "<p>The same questions of confidence are going to surround Secretary-General Ban\u2019s newly announced \u201cexternal independent review.\u201d</p>", "<p>A spokesman for the Code Blue campaigners, for example, \u201cwelcomed\u201d the announcement and then added provisos, starting with \u201cNo member of existing U.N. staff should be appointed to investigate nor to act as the investigators\u2019 secretariat,\u201d and the notion that the broader the inquiry, the better.</p>", "<p>To be credible, the spokesman added, the inquiry should include an examination of \u201ctop members of the Secretary-General\u2019s own staff,\u201d singling out by title Dubinsky, LaPointe and Malcorra.</p>", "<p>But there should also be plenty of other grist for the panelists\u2019 work, including a report that OIOS itself has promised to make public by mid-June, entitled an \u201cEvaluation of protection against sexual exploitation and abuse in peacekeeping operations.\u201d</p>", "<p>Based on recent U.N. experience, the news it brings is unlikely to be good.</p>", "<p><i>George Russell is editor-at-large of Fox News and can be found on Twitter: \u00a0@GeorgeRussell or on Facebook.com/George Russell</i></p>"]}

agree that keeping serious criminals in prison is an effective means of preserving public safety, but we must also recognize that the axiom of \u201cputting people in jail and throwing away the key\u201d does not apply to all offenders universally, and can actually be counterproductive. </p>", "<p>Incarcerating non-violent offenders in the same population as more dangerous criminals has the effect of inculcating the former into a culture of criminality common among the latter, making them more of a risk to public safety upon release than when they originally went in.</p>", "<p>\u201cTough on crime\u201d policies, particularly mandatory sentences, tend to set such circumstances in stone, and vitiates the possibility of seeking out alternative, evidence-based programs that can divert amenable offenders into treatment. </p>", "<p>Such programs are more cost-effective, and most importantly, have been proven to reduce the likelihood of recidivism. </p>", "<p>Recognition of this has been just one instance of states taking \u201ccrime more seriously,\u201d and indeed, being\u00a0<i>smarter</i>\u00a0on crime. </p>", "<p>There\u2019s nothing conservative about allowing ourselves to become so inured to a \u201ctough on crime\u201d frame of mind that we would abandon tested alternatives that can yield better outcomes.</p>", "<p>Consider Texas. Since 2005, Texas has created drug courts, instituted swift and certain sanctions for those in violation of their terms of release, and incentivized offenders to comply with terms of probation. </p>", "<p>As a result of these reforms and others, Texas has realized a reduction in its incarceration rate of 12% since 2009, and its lowest crime rate since 1968\u2014at the same time, it should be noted, as reserving mandatory sentences for only the most violent or repeat offenders. </p>", "<p>Other conservative states have passed their own similar reforms in the last decade, and the Senate\u2019s bill draws on these lessons for the federal system.</p>", "<p>It\u2019s worthwhile at this point to highlight an important misconception among those against reform: namely, that increased incarceration translates directly to lower crime rates. </p>", "<p>While this may be true to an extent, studies have shown that only about 25% of our recent crime rate reduction can be attributed to imprisoning more people. </p>", "<p>In fact, according to the Pew Trusts, those states that have <i>reduced</i> incarceration have <a href=\"https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__www.pewtrusts.org_en_multimedia_data-2Dvisualizations_2015_imprisonment-2Dcrime-2Drates-2Dfell-2Din-2D30-2Dstates-2Dover-2Dfive-2Dyears&amp;d=CwMFAg&amp;c=RAhzPLrCAq19eJdrcQiUVEwFYoMRqGDAXQ_puw5tYjg&amp;r=Et5YdIyy-C0W2BTIH62ehqB-arbKzolU7qDKR2mCSoY&amp;m=gQWqn3fKNtC8WQsMJCq-WZ0WKsS_fy-esmKp3vMheK0&amp;s=TDMD-BOMrTvb75Hpd_goOt1hB_5-_yYyLtr3dYaOZsE&amp;e=\" target=\"_blank\">enjoyed the largest concomitant reductions</a>\u00a0in their crime rates. Therefore, attempts to draw any meaningful correlation between the two is perilous, particularly when arguing that curbing mandatory sentencing will yield higher instances of crime.</p>", "<p>Provisions including retroactivity where mandatory sentences have been shortened could indeed result in altered sentences, but such reductions would not be automatic, coming only after a court has considered various sentencing factors, including risk of recidivism, danger to the public, and prison misconduct. </p>", "<p>In fact, every provision of the federal Senate bill that reduces a mandatory sentence is coupled with judicial oversight. Therefore, any suggestion that Congress would be \u201cletting criminals out of prison\u201d haphazardly is without merit.</p>", "<p>The federal prison population has exploded by nearly 800 percent since 1980, fueled in large part by mandatory sentences that lock in definite stays behind bars, and don\u2019t allow for judicial discretion that treat cases on an individualized basis. </p>", "<p>Even without mandatory sentences, judges are still capable of levying tough penalties for serious offenses\u2014and just as in states like Texas that have \u201ctough on crime\u201d reputations, this can be done without jeopardizing public safety.</p>", "<p>Ken Cuccinelli is the former attorney general for Virginia, and a signatory to the Right on Crime statement of principles.</p>"]}

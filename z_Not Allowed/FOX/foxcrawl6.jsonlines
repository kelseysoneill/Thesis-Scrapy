The video prompted protests and led to a wide-ranging civil rights investigation of the entire police department by the U.S. Department of Justice.<br> </p>", "<p>Monday's 72-page opinion from U.S. District Judge Edmond Chang was part of a civil lawsuit brought by relatives of Darius Pinex, a black man, who was shot and killed by police during a 2011 traffic stop in Chicago.<br> </p>", "<p>The officers, Raoul Mosqueda and Gildardo Sierra, said they opened fire as Pinex refused orders and put his car in reverse. The officers had said they stopped Pinex because his car matched a description they heard on their police radio of a car suspected of involvement in an earlier shooting. But records emerged after the trial began that officers weren't listening to the channel broadcasting the radio traffic about the suspect's car. The judge said a city lawyer \"intentionally concealed\" that evidence.<br> </p>", "<p>The judge on Monday tossed a jury's finding in April that the police shooting was justified, ordered a new trial and instructed the city to pay attorney's fees to the plaintiffs.<br> </p>", "<p>\"Attorneys who might be tempted to bury late-surfacing information need to know that, if discovered, any verdict they win will be forfeit and their clients will pay the price,\" the judge wrote. He said Jordan Marsh, a senior corporation counsel, also later lied about when he was aware of the evidence.</p>", "<p>The judge also accused the law department, which defends city employees accused of wrongdoing, of shoddy record-keeping, saying it contributed to the problem in the Pinex case.<br> </p>", "<p>The city law department announced Marsh's resignation later Monday, saying it \"does not tolerate any action that would call into question the integrity of the lawyers who serve\" Chicago. It also said it was reviewing its training and evidence-gathering procedures.<br> </p>", "<p>But a lawyer for the Pinex family, Steve Greenberg, said Marsh's actions reflect on the city law department as a whole.

Few communications from Emanuel's staff mention the mayor directly \u2014 though several refer to him by the acronym \"MRE.\"</p>", "<p>A video of the officer shooting McDonald \u2014 which was not made public until more than a year later, on Nov. 24 \u2014 led to protests and repeated calls for Emanuel to resign. The officer, Jason Van Dyke, has been charged with murder and pleaded not guilty this week at his arraignment.</p>", "<p>Emanuel has denied ever seeing the video prior to its release, a contention many activists have said they do not believe. The emails do not appear to contradict Emanuel's claim, though they show how City Hall grew increasingly concerned that the video could pose a major public-relations problem.</p>", "<p>In early December 2014, Scott Ando, head of the Independent Police Review Authority \u2014 publicly touted by the mayor as uniquely independent in its probes of police shootings \u2014 singled out the case. He sent an email to the mayor's deputy chief of staff, Janey Rountree, with a link to a website that raised questions about police accounts of the shooting.</p>", "<p>Emanuel spokesman Adam Collins sent a flurry of emails about media inquiries into video of the shooting. His subject line on a Dec. 10, 2014, email to fellow Emanuel staffers included the headline in one Chicago newspaper: \"If Chicago police have video of teen shooting, let's see it: advocates.\"</p>", "<p>The risk that a publicly released video could blow up not just locally but also nationally was made by lawyers from McDonald's family, who reached out to the city about a settlement in early 2015, just over a month before Emanuel's re-election.</p>", "<p>Although none of the correspondence directly addressed Emanuel, in a letter on March 6 \u2014 after the family's lawyers saw the video \u2014 attorney Jeffrey J. Neslund told city lawyers that the footage would reflect badly on the city.</p>", "<p>\"I submit the graphic dash cam video will have a powerful impact on any jury and the Chicago community as a whole,\" he wrote. \"This case will undoubtedly bring a microscope of national attention to the shooting itself as well as the city's pattern, practice and procedures in rubber-stamping fatal police shootings of African Americans as 'justified.'\"</p>", "<p>He demanded $16 million. The two sides eventually settled on $5 million, a deal approved by the city council shortly after Emanuel won a second term.</p>", "<p>Though the Independent Police Review Authority, or IPRA, is supposed to maintain a distance from police and the mayor's office, a March 11 email from Ando asks about forwarding witness interview transcripts to the law department \"for their use in settlement negotiations with\" the McDonald family.</p>", "<p>In May, Collins cautioned IPRA spokesman Larry Merritt to \"tread lightly\" when a reporter asked for an IPRA interview about the case.</p>", "<p>\"Can anyone do an interview? I think we need to accept some of these opportunities,\" Merritt wrote in a May 26 email to top Emanuel aides and Ando. \"These stories are getting done with or without us.\"</p>", "<p>Collins responded: \"I completely agree that we need to engage more, but if their focus is on specifics (sic) investigations we should tread very lightly. This is about Laquan McDonald and we should not do interviews about open investigations.\"</p>", "<p>Also in May, Collins complained to colleagues that IPRA did not follow his recommendation on how to respond to a TV station about McDonald.</p>", "<p>Days before the video's release, Collins wrote to police and law department representatives urging them to speak with \"one voice\" on the topic.</p>", "<p>Emanuel and Chicago police have been under heavy scrutiny since the city, under court order, released the squad-car video. McDonald, who was carrying a folded 3-inch knife, is seen veering away from officer Jason Van Dyke in the video before the officer starts firing.</p>", "<p>Months before the video was made public, Emanuel's administration was well aware of growing outrage about the case. In a late July email exchange, top Emanuel aides worried about the perception of a cover-up and noted recent news stories.</p>", "<p>\"As you might imagine, the timing and details discussed in the Sun-Times article and growing interest in the McDonald incident has not worked in our favor, and is helping to 'stir the pot,'\" Emanuel aide Vance Henry wrote.</p>", "<p>By October, Henry noted organizing by community groups around the McDonald case and the fatal shooting of 22-year-old Rekia Boyd by another Chicago officer. He suggested in an Oct. 11 email that officials would be \"smart to act timely and strategically\" in both cases.</p>", "<p>The release of the video forced the resignation of Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy and led to an ongoing civil rights investigation of the entire Chicago Police Department by the U.S. Department of Justice.</p>", "<p>The city released the emails less than a week after police fatally shot two other people: 55-year-old Bettie Jones, who authorities said was killed accidentally, and 19-year-old Quintonio LeGrier, who police said was being \"combative.\" Both were black.</p>", "<p><i>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</i></p>"]}

Flint has since returned to Detroit's system for its water, but officials remain concerned that damage to the pipes caused by the Flint River could allow them to continue leaching lead.

FEMA has appointed a disaster recovery coordinator.</p>", "<p>U.S. Rep. Dan Kildee, a Democrat who represents the Flint area, has consistently criticized Snyder's response to the issue and advocated for greater federal assistance. He said Friday that he was glad to see Snyder's request.</p>", "<p>Kildee said in a statement that \"thousands of children of Flint who have been poisoned are the victims in this situation.\" He said Snyder's request \"is an important step toward making sure they get the help they need.\"</p>"]}

On Thursday, the city released video of a 2013 shooting in which a white officer shot and killed a 17-year-old black carjacking suspect, igniting fresh concerns.</p>", "<p>Protesters tried to block the entrance to Friday's breakfast.

That came after the city -- in a surprise about-face -- dropped its longstanding opposition to making it public.</p>", "<p>The video was taken by several surveillance cameras and from various angles.

Chatman scoots through parked cars and toward an intersection. Less than 10 seconds pass from the time Chatman jumped out of the car to the fatal shots.</p>", "<p>Officer Kevin Fry can be seen trailing behind Toth, aiming his gun at Chatman from a crosswalk and firing as the teen began rounding the corner in front of a bodega. One video from a camera that pans back and forth is grainy and it doesn't show Chatman fall; another is clearer and shows Chatman fall, but it is taken from farther away and doesn't show definitively if Chatman ever turned.</p>", "<p>Immediately after Thursday's hearing, Chatman family attorney Brain Coffman was asked if a criminal case should be reopened based on the video and other evidence. He answered, \"Absolutely.\" In a phone interview later, he said it was Cook County State's Attorney Anita Alvarez's call and that he hoped she would give the shooting \"a second look.\"</p>", "<p>But at a news conference on Thursday, Alvarez didn't seem inclined to do that.</p>", "<p>When asked if she could reopen the Chatman case, she responded, \"We looked at that case back in 2013 and determined that no criminal charges were warranted.\"</p>", "<p>Fry, the only officer to shoot that day, said in a 2014 deposition that he opened fire with his .45 caliber semi-automatic pistol out of fear for his own life and his partner's after Chatman \"makes a slight turn\" holding an object.</p>", "<p>\"It was a small black object, which I believed to be a handgun,\" Fry said.</p>", "<p>Investigators said later the object was an iPhone box. Coffman says the teen never turned toward the officers and posed no threat.</p>", "<p>The Independent Police Review Authority, which investigates police shootings, cleared the officer who shot Chatman of any wrongdoing.

Davis has filed a separate lawsuit about his dismissal. IPRA has declined to comment on Davis' case because the litigation is ongoing.</p>", "<p>In the Laquan McDonald case, the city fought the release of dashcam video for more than a year, making it public only after a state court ordered it to do so. The video and the delay in releasing it led to protests and calls for Mayor Rahm Emanuel to resign.</p>", "<p>Chatman's family had asked that the video in his case be made public, arguing it would counter the city's narrative that Chatman posed a danger to police. City attorneys, until Wednesday, fought to keep it under seal on grounds its release could taint any jury pool should the civil case go to trial. They said in a Wednesday court filing that the city was dropping its opposition in an effort to be more transparent while it waits for a recently created special task force to review policies regarding the release of videos showing disputed police shootings.</p>", "<p>Gettleman sharply criticized the city attorneys for suddenly changing their position on the video's release on policy grounds, not legal grounds, after spending weeks trying to prevent it.</p>", "<p>\"I went to a lot of trouble to decide this issue, and then I get this motion last night (Wednesday) saying that this is the Age of Enlightenment with the city and we're going to be transparent,\" Gettleman said. \"I think it's irresponsible.\"</p>", "<p><i>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</i></p>"]}

He was 74.</p>", "<p>Cianci's employer, WLNE-TV, and a friend, Artin Coloian, confirmed his death. Coloian said he died Thursday morning. He did not release the cause. WLNE said he was taping his weekly show, \"On the Record with Buddy Cianci, Wednesday evening when he had severe stomach pains and was taken by ambulance to Miriam Hospital.</p>", "<p>Cianci was elected to six terms as mayor, a period that coincided with the resurrection of Providence from a decaying, Industrial-age relic to a 21st-century city with gondolas plying newly uncovered rivers. His bare-fisted style of politics made Cianci larger than life even in a tiny state known for the outsized personalities of its public figures.</p>", "<p>\"He's the most talented politician that New England has produced since John Kennedy,\" former University of Rhode Island political scientist Marc Genest said in a 2002 interview.</p>", "<p>The charismatic mayor became ensnared in an FBI investigation into City Hall corruption, code-named \"Operation Plunder Dome.\" In 2001, he was indicted charges he orchestrated bribes for jobs, contracts and contributions to his campaign fund.</p>", "<p>Cianci vehemently proclaimed his innocence: \"I have said to you before, there are no stains on this jacket, and I assure you there still are no stains on this jacket,\" he said after the indictment.</p>", "<p>The case went to trial in 2002. In a circus-like trial that lasted seven weeks and featured a local who's who list of wise guys and mob wannabes, a jury found Cianci guilty of one count of racketeering conspiracy. He was sentenced to five years, four months in a federal prison.</p>", "<p>He was released from prison in 2007. He would later call his prison term a \"bump in the road.\"</p>", "<p>After prison, he resumed his career as a radio talk show host and TV commentator, but the pull back to politics was strong.</p>", "<p>\"All the things that they celebrate in this city are the things that I did,\" Cianci said in 2014 as he contemplated a comeback bid for mayor.</p>", "<p>Despite being diagnosed with cancer the same year, he chose to jump in, running as an independent. Faced with the possibility of a Cianci return to office, several Democratic candidates dropped out to consolidate support behind political newcomer Jorge Elorza. The idea of a new Cianci administration was so objectionable that even the Republican candidate donated $1,000 to Elorza and then voted for him.</p>", "<p>Cianci lost, but still pulled in 45 percent of the vote.</p>", "<p>Ironically, Cianci began his public career as a state prosecutor on the attorney general's anti-corruption task force. For six years, he made a name for himself going after members of the powerful mob families.</p>", "<p>In 1974, at 32, he capitalized on a rift in the dominant Democratic Party to win the mayoral post as a Republican. His first three terms were marred by scandal. Twenty-two city workers and contractors were convicted of corruption charges, including Cianci's chief of staff and city solicitor. But the mayor was never charged.</p>", "<p>\"I knew so little,\" he said later. \"I learned and grew in the job.\"</p>", "<p>In 1980, he ran for governor. But he was soundly defeated by Democratic incumbent Joseph Garrahy. He returned as mayor in a subsequent election.</p>", "<p>Personal problems sidetracked Cianci's career in 1984.</p>", "<p>He pleaded no contest to attacking his estranged wife's alleged lover with an ashtray, lit cigarette, and a fireplace log. As a condition of his plea deal, he was forced to resign.</p>", "<p>Cianci took a job as a talk-radio host on a local station and regained the mayor's office in 1990. The second coming of Cianci coincided with \"Providence renaissance.\"</p>", "<p>Rivers that had run through underground culverts were reclaimed. Ornate walkways and bridges graced the rivers. Providence landed the largest mall in the region. People flocked to a downtown that just decades ago had been a dangerous, seamy zone. The hugely popular WaterFire display lighted up the rivers with floating braziers of crackling, burning cedar.</p>", "<p>Cianci soaked up the notoriety. He marketed his own line of pasta sauce and became a fixture on the national \"Imus in the Morning\" radio show.</p>", "<p>But beneath the glitter, the city was rotting. Buddy's Providence was a town for sale, federal prosecutors said, where even routine dealings with City Hall \u2014 such as applying for jobs or bidding on contracts \u2014 meant greasing a few palms.</p>", "<p>\"I used my public power for personal reasons. I admit it,\" Cianci wrote in a 2011 memoir. \"It probably wasn't the right thing to do, but it certainly felt good.\"</p>", "<p>Cianci maintained his innocence, and appealed his conviction while incarcerated. His appeals failed.</p>", "<p>\"I love this city. It's a very, very saddening thought to be separated from it,\" he told The Associated Press the morning he left for prison. \"My whole life, personally and professionally, has revolved around it.

In the early 21st century, Siemens began to pay reparations to the workers it had paid nary a pfennig to 55 years earlier.\"</p>", "<p>Will companies signing up to do business with Iran be shamed and perhaps forced by law at a future date to pay reparations to the families of those killed by Islamic terrorists funded by the Iranian regime?</p>", "<p>IG Farben was another company that dealt with Nazi Germany. The company licensed to various companies the pesticide Zyklon B, which was used to suffocate millions in the death camps. \"In 1951,\" notes McFarlane, \"when the victors partitioned Germany, the Western Allies restored IG Farben into its original components,\" which included BASF, maker of cassette tapes. \"Today, BASF continues to trade as one of the featured securities on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, with a market capitalization of $60 billion.\"</p>", "<p>A line from \"The Godfather\" seems an appropriate analogy. Just before someone is assassinated he is told, \"Nothing personal, it's strictly business.\"</p>", "<p>In a twist on this theme, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1998/08/01/news/01iht-gold.t.html\" target=\"_blank\">Deutsche Bank</a> in 1998 accepted \"moral responsibility\" for its dealings with the Nazis. These dealings included knowingly buying gold taken from people murdered in the camps.</p>", "<p>What would be the morally responsible approach to Iran? Because the regime is complicit in the use of Improvised Explosive Devices (<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/war-zones/weapons-prove-iranian-role-in-iraq-us-says/2011/07/05/gHQAUnkmzH_story.html\" target=\"_blank\">IEDs</a>), which have led to the deaths of American servicemen and women, the morally responsible thing to do is not to conduct business with Iran.</p>", "<p>Given the depths to which human nature appears to have sunk, however, that is unlikely to happen.

They involved six children\u00a0 from the battered CAR--an epicenter of the sex abuse scandal. Banbury also said the total number of allegations involving U.N. forces world-wide this year was likely to be 69, or double the number that\u00a0 they have made public so far to troop contributing countries.</p>", "<p>In a break with the U.N.\u2019s normal discreet silence regarding the nationality of alleged offenders, Banbury reeled off a list of nations\u2014Bangladesh, Morocco, Niger, Senegal and the Democratic Republic of Congo\u2014that were involved in the CAR allegations, which ranged from sexual assault to sexual relations \u201cpossibly for money.\u201d</p>", "<p>In all, he said, there were 22 sexual exploitation and abuse cases in 2015 involving the U.N. peacekeeping force known as MINUSCA. Without the CAR cases, he said, the overall trend for U.N. sexual abuse allegations as reflected in official U.N. numbers would be declining, as it had in previous years.</p>", "<p>At the same time, he hailed the investigations in CAR that had led to the latest revelations as \u201cthe first time we have seen parts of the U.N. work together in this way,\u201d and called the effort \u201cmaybe a model\u201d for other probes.</p>", "<p>He explained the delay in providing more details about other alleged abuse cases by noting that they were \u201cat different stages\u201d and declaring that determining allegations was \u201cnot a precise science.\u201d</p>", "<p>\u201cThere are definitely other allegations out there,\u201d he said.</p>", "<p>Banbury added that more would be revealed in connection with the roll-out in \u201clate February\u201d of Secretary General Ban Ki-moon\u2019s report on measures to reduce the \u201cscourge\u201d of sexual abuse, which would also inaugurate unprecedented transparency of detail on outlining sexual abuse cases on a public website in the future.</p>", "<p>Banbury spoke hours after the Geneva-based U.N. High Commission for Human Rights, Zeid Ra\u2019ad Al Hussein, announced he was \u201cextremely alarmed\u201d by \u201c new\u201d revelations of similar alleged abuses by non-U.N. forces in CAR. Most of the \u201cnew\u201d alleged cases took place in 2014, but according to Zeid, \u201conly came to light in recent weeks.\u201d\u00a0</p>", "<p>Zeid\u2019s announcement said that the subsequent announcement from New York was based on information gleaned by the same team of U.N. investigators who had provided the latest information to him.</p>", "<p>The High Commissioner specifically named forces from France and the republic of Georgia as being involved in allegations of rape and sexual relations for such things as water and cookies, and indicated that further nationalities involved in European Union forces in CAR might also be implicated.</p>", "<p>The sudden but coordinated statements from New York and Geneva came only two days after the Fox News story, which centered on a radical proposal by a gadfly organization, AIDS-Free World, to abolish U.N. oversight of sexual abuse allegations altogether, and instead put them in the hands of an independent oversight body selected by U.N. member states without input from the international bureaucracy.</p>", "<p>AIDS-Free World officials said they had been circulating their proposals, part of their Code Blue campaign to bring radical reform to the U.N. sexual abuse issue, among a number of influential member states, and had gotten expressions of interest from at least three of them, which were not named.</p>", "<p>The Code Blue campaign has kept steady pressure on the sex abuse scandal for nearly a year, publishing internal U.N. documents that described what investigators called a \u201cculture of silence\u201d and \u201cenforcement avoidance\u201d where sexual abuse is involved.</p>", "<p>The campaign also unveiled internal emails that last December led the independent panel of jurists to castigate specific U.N. officials for inaction in the probe of alleged CAR sex crimes. One of the officials criticized, though not so harshly, in that report \u00a0was Zeid.</p>", "<p>For his part, Banbury appeared to struggle with emotion as he declared that the U.N. was \u201cdoing everything we possibly can\u201d to assist sexual abuse victims, bring \u201caccountability and justice\u201d and prevent recurrence of such incidents, even while insisting that most of the additional details would await the Secretary General\u2019s report.</p>", "<p>AIDS-Free World co-director Paula Donovan, on the other hand, expressed both frustration and anger at the U.N. publicity effort, and at the impression she felt it tried to convey that the world organization\u2019s attempt to portray the latest information as part of a \u201cproactive\u201d approach to the sex abuse scandal.</p>", "<p>The large number of revealed cases in CAR, she told Fox News, was an indication that it was the only nation where the U.N. had \u201cscratched the surface\u201d across its sprawling array of peacekeeping missions.</p>", "<p>In a withering rejoinder to Banbury\u2019s assertions, she also told Fox News that \u201cthere is no confusion on the part of criminal and law enforcement officials about whether to call each individual case of abuse a separate allegation, or whether to lump them together in some artistic and para-scientific way\u201d to \u201cmake it look as if the situation was getting better.\u201d</p>", "<p>\u201cWhat today\u2019s announcement points to,\u201d she said, Is that if you look hard enough, there are numerous victims. There is nothing unique about the CAR.\u201d</p>", "<p>It seemed likely that AIDS-Free World would also be looking further. Donovan told Fox News that she had just been in the Netherlands to receive a financial grant that would allow her organization to pursue its Code Blue efforts.</p>", "<p><i>George Russell is Editor-at-Large of Fox News.

It\u2019s critical role in our national security cannot be overstated.</p>", "<p>Early last year, I visited Guantanamo Bay and witnessed prisoner operations. I saw firsthand that it is not the barebones prison camp President Obama purports it to be. In fact, it couldn\u2019t be further from the picture he\u2019s painted for the public.</p>", "<p>Guantanamo Bay can be and has been visited repeatedly by the International Red Cross and other human-rights groups for observation in an open, regular, and transparent manner. Detainees receive the same medical care as the guard force and are able to participate in their daily prayer sessions.</p>", "<p>Guantanamo Bay is also a critical tool in our counterterrorism efforts. It is secure from attack and allows us to concentrate trained experts in interrogation in one place, to extract intelligence of paramount importance in uncovering and stopping plots against Americans.</p>", "<p>Information obtained from detainees at Guantanamo has been described by the CIA as \"the lead information\" that enabled the agency to recognize the importance of a courier for Usama bin Laden, a crucial understanding that lead to Bin Laden's secret hideout in Pakistan and the U.S. raid that killed him. It is this kind of information that we are losing by not making greater use of Guantanamo.</p>", "<p>Additionally, take for example what\u2019s happened to those \u201cdetainees\u201d who have been released from Guantanamo Bay.</p>", "<p>In 2007, the U.S. released Mullah Abdul Rauf, a former Taliban commander who claimed to have been a simple bread deliveryman. In the interim, he has reestablished himself as a warlord in southern Afghanistan-- one who pledged his allegiance to the Islamic State-- and led a group of insurgent fighters.Earlier this year, U.S. forces had to face him again. Thankfully, they killed him.</p>", "<p>Rauf is just one example amidst many. Over 650 detainees have been released from Guantanamo, with 196 being confirmed or suspected of having returned to the battlefield-- a 30 percent recidivism rate. This number is likely much higher and is made even more stark when measured against the recidivism rate of those who haven\u2019t been released: zero.</p>", "<p>Less than a week before President Obama took the podium for his final address, his administration released a dangerous Guantanamo Bay detainee, Mahmud Umar Muhammad Bin Atef, who also reportedly made some remarks worth noting.\u00a0 \u201cAll Americans shall die because these were the rules of Allah,\u201d and he threatened to \u201cresearch guard force personnel\u2019s names and faces on the Internet and sneak into their homes to cut their throats like sheep.\u201d</p>", "<p>President Obama likes to say Guantanamo Bay is a terrorist recruiting tool and while that may be an easy excuse, it\u2019s simply not true. The reality is the motivations of radical Islamic jihadism existed before Guantanamo Bay. The ideology is premised on a narrative of conquest, in the spiritual as well as the earthly world.</p>", "<p>They attack us not for what they believe we have done to them, or to Muslims around the world. They attack us for who we are and what we believe in.</p>", "<p>President Obama\u2019s State of the Union address was little more than a laundry list of the bad policies and government overreach that will define his policy. I am hopeful that when he departs next January he won\u2019t be able to add closing Guantanamo Bay to his highlight reel. \u00a0\u00a0</p>", "<p>In fact, we should be sending <i>more</i> terrorists to Guantanamo Bay, not looking for ways to release murders like Bin Atef, who want to slit soldiers\u2019 throats.</p>", "<p>Closing this facility for President Obama\u2019s political legacy would be a grave mistake that would put our national security at risk and be a propaganda boon for radical Islam.</p>", "<p>Republican Tom Cotton represents Arkansas in the United States Senate.</p>"]}

LEARN-NVLS, the ALPR data system from Vigilant contains nearly 3 billion plate scans and pulls in more than 70 million more each month.</p>", "<p>\u201cVigilant likes to say that drivers don\u2019t have a right to privacy because of license plates but that\u2019s baloney,\u201d Maass said. \u201cThey are taking advantage of a public safety rule that came years before anyone thought that data collection like this would be possible.\u201d</p>", "<p>Officials for Vigilant did not immediately respond to requests for comment, but in a press release from December, the company boasted that its systems were used by law enforcement in Guadalupe County to collect on more than 4,500 warrants since April of that year.

Roosevelt, Eisenhower, Kennedy and their predecessors aggressively enforced those laws, denying entry to agents of enemies such as Nazi Germany and Communist dictatorships.</p>", "<p>Essential to enforcement was the careful screening of <i>every</i> would-be immigrant from an enemy nation in order to separate the legitimate ones from those who posed dangerous political or criminal threats.</p>", "<p>Jacques Gadiel\u2019s experience as a refugee immigrant showed the thoroughness that President Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s administration employed to safeguard our people.</p>", "<p>Gadiel was my father, a German Jew, a perfect target for murder by Hitler's government. In addition, he and my mother, a German Protestant, had committed the ultimate \u201ccrime\u201d of marrying in violation of the Nazi race laws. As prime targets for the Gestapo, they agreed that if they were somehow separated, each would try to reach safe haven in any country that would accept them.</p>", "<p>As a result, with a visa issued by the U.S. charg\u00e9 in Lisbon, Portugal, my father arrived alone in the United States on April 25, 1941. His German passport had a big red \"J\" for \"Juden\" (Jew) stamped on it. He was in proximate danger of being murdered, as legitimate a refugee as one could be. Despite that legitimacy, the FBI took him into custody as soon as he arrived. He was held for over a week, during which time federal agents including a German-born psychiatrist carefully interrogated him to ensure that he was, in fact, a legitimate refugee and not a threat to U.S. security.</p>", "<p>\"They practically looked under my fillings to make sure that I was what I said I was,\" he told me years later. I asked him if he had been angry or offended that the U.S. government treated him in this manner after he had evaded the Nazis. His response: \"No. Not at all. I was glad. I didn't want Nazis in this country any more than FDR did. I came here to be <i>safe</i>.\"</p>", "<p>And for the rest of his life, he was. But not so his grandson \u2013 my son, James Gadiel, who was murdered at the age of 23<b> </b>by Islamic terrorists as he worked in the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001.</p>", "<p>James died because the screening of immigrants has been abandoned. </p>", "<p>That abandonment was begun by Pres. Carter. In 1980 he accepted 125,000 Cuban refugees with no inspection whatever. Fidel Castro exploited Carter's negligence by emptying his prisons of criminals and shipping them to us among the legitimate refugees. </p>", "<p>Later, Pres. Reagan signed an amnesty which was exploited by criminals and illegal aliens using forged documents to remain in the USA and obtain citizenship. Illegal immigration (that is, immigration without screening) continued under George H.W. Bush, and Bill Clinton permitted, even encouraged, ever more massive illegal immigration. </p>", "<p>It was during his administration that the 9/11 terrorists were admitted into the U.S. Even after the 9/11 attacks President George W. Bush continued to refuse to enforce our immigration laws leaving our borders wide open to Islamic terrorists and other criminals.</p>", "<p>That reckless \u2013 even criminal \u2013 policy has been brought to its ultimate by President Obama who now imports, by the hundreds of thousands, people from nations whose cultures and governing entities are enemies of our values, religions and freedoms \u2013 all without screening.</p>", "<p>From FDR's policies designed to protect our people to Obama's policies of intentionally bringing in the enemy. What a sad descent from decency and sanity.</p>", "<p><i>Peter Gadiel is a retired businessman and lawyer.

Iran is testing long-range, precision-guided ballistic missiles that could deliver a nuclear bomb, arguably in violation of U.N. agreements, and the terms of the Obama administration\u2019s much-trumpeted nuclear deal. North Korea is testing, or claims to be testing, hydrogen bombs; for years, the U.S. has essentially ignored Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear ambitions.</p>", "<p>And after executing a prominent Shiite cleric, Saudi Arabia has cut off diplomatic relations with Iran after a mob set ablaze the Saudi embassy in Tehran. The tensions between these Middle East rivals bode poorly for American relations with each country as well as for regional stability (such as it is).</p>", "<p>In short, this is hardly the time for America to disengage from the world. But to listen to the leading presidential candidates in both parties, disengagement seems to be where the momentum is. And that\u2019s where Putin comes in\u2014because while disengagement will cost the United States dearly, it\u2019s a windfall for the Russian president.</p>", "<p>On the Republican side, it\u2019s no surprise that Putin has boosted Donald Trump as \u201ca very bright and talented man and the absolute leader in the presidential race.\u201d In Trump, Putin sees the candidate most like him: driven by ego and deal-making over long-term thinking. Putin also knew that Trump would welcome his \u201cendorsement\u201d and defend him.</p>", "<p>And Trump did.\u00a0</p>", "<p>When asked about allegations that Putin has had journalists murdered, Trump coolly replied, \u201cI think our country does plenty of killing also.\u201d In his <i>60 Minutes</i> interview last fall, Trump boasted that he and Putin would \u201cget along very well\u201d and that if \u201c[Putin] wants to be bombing ISIS, let him bomb them\u201d\u2014another indication of a hands-off American approach in the region. Trump believes he and Putin can cooperate: \u201cI believe \u2013 and I may be wrong, in which case I\u2019d probably have to take a different path. But I would get along with a lot of the world leaders that this country is not getting along with,\u201d he said at the CNN debate in September.</p>", "<p>Trump\u2019s closest rival is Texas senator Ted Cruz, who has been a strident Putin critic. Cruz has promised that as president, he wouldn\u2019t allow Putin \u201cto move unimpeded into the [Middle East] to advance an agenda that is contrary to our own,\u201d has called for a reassertion of American exceptionalism, and says that America should \u201cemulate the decisive actions that empowered Ronald Reagan to win the Cold War without firing a shot.\u201d</p>", "<p>That isn\u2019t Putin-friendly language, to be sure. But Cruz\u2019s bellicose rhetoric obscures the substance of his proposed policies, which would play right into Russia\u2019s hands. In practical effect, Cruz is expressing a pro-Putin position when he says, \u201cIf we topple [Syrian president] Assad, ISIS will take over Syria and it will worsen U.S. national security interests,\u201d or when he mistakenly claims \u201cthat removing Assad from power would be \u201cmaterially worse for U.S. national security interests.\u201d</p>", "<p>The senator is dead wrong.</p>", "<p>If the United States disengages in Syria and stays on the sidelines in the Middle East, we will leave a void that will be filled by Russia and its proxies, Hamas and Hezbollah. Leaving Assad in power will send a message to our allies that we continue to allow red lines to be crossed.</p>", "<p>A Cruz presidency would leave room for the Russians and Chinese to advance their interests\u2014whether in the Middle East or in the South China Sea. Not to mention the holes left by his opposition to the metadata program, a serious national security need that Cruz doesn\u2019t support.</p>", "<p>We\u2019ve had enough of these hands-off policies already, under President Obama. Putin is making inroads with longtime U.S. allies in the Middle East, such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt, both disgruntled with the administration\u2019s lack of support. Putin met with Saudi Arabia\u2019s defense minister in Moscow last October, where they \u201cconfirmed that Saudi Arabia and Russia have similar goals\u201d in Syria. The Egyptian government signed a contract with Russia\u2019s state-owned Rosatom Atomic Energy to build a nuclear plant in Egypt.</p>", "<p>Sure, some Republican candidates\u2014especially Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush, and Carly Fiorina\u2014are taking a hard line against Putin. But none are faring well in the polls. Rubio can\u2019t break out of the low teens, and Bush languishes in the low single digits. Fiorina is sliding into also-ran status.</p>", "<p>On the Democratic side, the Obama administration\u2019s obvious mishandling of Russian policy has given Putin lots of room to pursue his goals\u2014and Hillary Clinton has endorsed Obama\u2019s policies across the board. She may have given Putin his biggest lift by praising the Russian Reset that she orchestrated as Secretary of State. In a 2014 NPR interview, she maintained that \u201cthe reset worked,\u201d and that it was meant to be a \u201cdevice to try to refocus attention on the transactional efforts that we needed to get done with the Russians.\u201d</p>", "<p>History tells a different story. Before Putin illegally annexed Crimea, Clinton went to Yalta and warned the Russians against aggression. The Russians came anyway. Since then, she has scarcely criticized the administration for its refusal to meaningfully aid an increasingly desperate Ukraine.</p>", "<p>Nor has Clinton dissociated herself from the administration\u2019s other foreign policy failures. She has supported the Iran nuclear deal without apparent concern about Russia\u2019s support, tacit and explicit, for the Tehran regime. And she has even backed Obama\u2019s failing ISIS strategy, offering that \u201ca lot of the right moves have been made\u201d and that she would have \u201cadvised him to do exactly as I believe he is now doing.\u201d</p>", "<p>This adds to the evidence that even though Hillary has decried Obama\u2019s foreign policy doctrine that we shouldn\u2019t \u201cdo stupid stuff\u201d \u2013 she said \u201cGreat nations need organizing principles, and \u201cDon\u2019t do stupid stuff\u201d is not an organizing principle\u201d \u2013 she seems to be tolerating and rationalizing ill conceived policies all the while saying we need to do more.</p>", "<p>Clinton, of course, is considered a lock to get the Democratic nomination. Trump and Cruz are lapping the Republican field.\u00a0 How things will play out remains to be seen, but the debate over whether Vladimir Putin is operating from a position of weakness or strength should stop.</p>", "<p>Putin has a clear strategy that has propelled him to military victory in Crimea, and he holds strong positions in Syria and Ukraine. He is on a mission to advance Russian interests around the world and reestablish Russia as a global superpower. We are doing nothing to stop him, and our politicians have no serious plan for the future.</p>", "<p>Just listen to America\u2019s leading presidential candidates. As long as they talk this way, it won\u2019t matter to Putin who\u2019s leading in the polls. He\u2019ll be assured that, come January 2017, another American president will help him #MakeRussiaGreatAgain.</p>", "<p><i>Douglas E. Schoen has served as a pollster for President Bill Clinton.

Secretariat\u00a0 annual budget (about $2.8 billion in 2015),\u00a0and 28.36 percent of\u00a0its peacekeeping budget, which has ballooned in the past few years to $8.47 billion in 2014-2015.</p>", "<p>The bigger the overall bills, the bigger is the share in dollar terms the U.S. must pay because of its outsized dues percentages.</p>", "<p>The next-biggest percentage payee,\u00a0Japan, forks over 10.83 percent of both the U.N.\u2019s regular budget and peacekeeping spending, and\u00a0as a result signed a check for\u00a0about $1.23 billion -- about 40\u00a0percent of the U.S. total. Powerhouses like Germany fall even further behind.</p>", "<p>The U.S. peacekeeping tab is more than the tally for the other four veto-wielding members of the U.N. Security Council -- France, the United Kingdom, China and Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russian Federation --combined.</p>", "<p>On the other hand,\u00a0 the least-paying 176 countries at the world organization -- and there are only 193 in the U.N. system -- coughed up\u00a0<i>in toto</i>\u00a0little more than Japan-- some $1.4 billion for both their peacekeeping and \u201cregular\u201d dues, according to figures compiled by the conservative Heritage Foundation.</p>", "<p>Taken separately, the peacekeeping tab for the Bottom 176 is even worse: about 10 percent of the bill, or roughly $848 million,\u00a0again less than Japan\u2019s share.</p>", "<p>This year, however, a few factors are favorable to change, starting with the fact that the annual cost of U.N. peacekeeping appears, for the first time in a decade, to be going down rather than up.</p>", "<p>Peacekeeping is currently estimated to cost U.N. member states about $8.27 billion in 2015-2016. (Typically for the U.N.\u2019s spaghetti-tangled system of bookkeeping, peacekeeping budgets are calculated from mid-year to mid-year, while \u201cregular\u201d U.N. budgets are calculated on a January-to-December basis -- but biennially.)</p>", "<p>One cause: A small number of expensive U.N. missions, including that in Haiti, for example, have shrunk considerably, and some are likely to shrink more.</p>", "<p>The other reason for a difference is that some of the biggest economies in the so-called developing world -- China, Russia, Korea, not to mention Brazil and Argentina -- are likely facing hikes in their U.N. percentage tabs due to rising local Gross Domestic Product, producing increases in their \u201cregular\u201d dues rates of 30 percent or more.</p>", "<p>In some cases, notably Argentina\u2019s, the hike will still be hard to spot:\u00a0that country\u2019s share of regular U.N. dues actually rose dramatically in the past two years -- from 0.0574 percent to .432 percent.\u00a0</p>", "<p>A further catch in the budget process is that many countries actually receive a\u00a0<i>discount</i>\u00a0from their\u00a0regular dues for peacekeeping, which the five veto power countries in the U.N. Security Council are expected to pick up as a \u201cpremium\u201d that ticks upward from their baseline \u201cregular\u201d budget dues in exchange for their veto-wielding status.</p>", "<p>Outcome: the U.S. once again gets hosed worse than other members of the veto club, even though the percentage increase in its \u201cpremium\u201d rate is the same as for other nations that don\u2019t pick up anywhere near as much of the U.N.\u2019s \u201cregular\u201d tab, because of its higher baseline, bringing its peacekeeping share to the current 28.36 percent level.</p>", "<p>\u201cWhen the math [of discounts] was created,\u00a0perhaps the dynamic was not clearly understood,\u201d says a U.S. official.</p>", "<p>This year, American effort is aimed, according to the official, at\u00a0ways \u201cto get the discounts streamlined, and eliminate those for the wealthiest countries.\u201d</p>", "<p>Among the countries targeted for persuasion are Saudi Arabia, the Gulf Arab states, and prosperous mini-states like Singapore.</p>", "<p>Saudi Arabia, for example, had an oil-inflated GDP of 746.25 billion in 2014, its highest level ever. But its share of the U.N. regular budget was a measly 0.864 percent, and its peacekeeping share, due to discounts, even lower: 0.518 percent.</p>", "<p>Spain, with twice the GDP of Saudi Arabia, but a much larger population -- which means its per-capita wealth is significantly less -- pays more than three times as much as\u00a0the Saudis for the regular U.N. budget, and nearly six times as much for peacekeeping.</p>", "<p>Will the U.S. effort pay off?</p>", "<p>\u201cThe situation is fluid,\u201d a U.S. diplomat told Fox News. \u201cI can\u2019t say we have clarity.\u201d</p>", "<p>In other words, no one is likely to be sure until somewhere around Christmas Eve, if then.</p>", "<p><i>George Russell is Editor-at-Large of Fox News.

At the forum Governors Chris Christie, Jeb Bush, John Kasich, and CEO Carly Fiorina shared personal stories that can help tear down the old stigmas of the \u201cjunkie\u201d and the \"addict\" and allow us to effectively address this growing epidemic that touches almost every American.</p>", "<p>When presidential candidates share their own stories of family and friends battling addiction, it makes it safer for all of us to do the same. If a governor, a CEO, a presidential candidate has family battling addiction, it may feel safer to bring our own families\u2019 struggles with substance abuse out from the shadows.\u00a0</p>", "<p>As Governor Christie explained during the New Hampshire Forum on Addiction, \u201cYou don\u2019t go to a neighborhood dinner party and say, \u201cHey, my daughter is addicted to heroin. What\u2019s new with you? But if she had cancer you would tell them.\u201d</p>", "<p>He\u2019s right. When a family struggles with addiction, where are the offers for help, the casserole dishes, the apple pies, note cards and community support you find when other challenges and tragedies strike our neighbors?</p>", "<p>I believe this month\u2019s forum can be part of a shift that reinforces that we all are affected by addiction in some way. With 22.7 million people in need of treatment and another 23 million in recovery, too many of our families are touched by the heartbreak of addiction. </p>", "<p>As Governor John Kasich remarked, \u201cThis disease knows no bounds, knows no income, knows no neighborhood, it's everywhere.\u201d</p>", "<p>Governor Jeb Bush opened up about his daughter\u2019s struggle with prescription drugs and remarked on the need to address stigma. \u201cWe need to eliminate the stigma and the barriers so more and more people get engaged with this. Where they are not embarrassed to say I have an illness and I\u2019m on the road to recovery.\u201d</p>", "<p>Carly Fiorina's stepdaughter died of a drug overdose in 2009.\u00a0She shared her family\u2019s painful story and the need to better treat addiction. \u201cUnfortunately, too many of the men and women I have met on the campaign trail have experienced tragedies like ours. This is a battle that we must fight. There are things that we can and must do,\u201d she said.</p>", "<p>Stigma has contributed to the worsening epidemic we are seeing nationwide, particularly with heroin and prescription drugs. Shame drives this pervasive disease into the shadows where individuals and families have less support, less treatment, less resources and a whole lot of isolation.</p>", "<p>Imagine if it were shameful to have cancer or asthma in America. Or, disgraceful to seek chemotherapy. Stigma is a dark environment that makes it hard for us to address the disease. New CDC data tells us that 129 people are dying of drug overdoses in our country each day. That\u2019s equivalent to two commuter plane crashes every day for an entire year. If you factor in alcohol-related deaths, that shoots up to over 300 needless deaths every day.</p>", "<p>Let\u2019s all continue the honest conversation that the presidential candidates have started, in order to bring addiction \u2013 how our family and friends have been affected, and our own personal struggles \u2013 out into the light to fight this epidemic.</p>", "<p><i>Authors Note: \u00a0The Addiction Policy Forum invited all presidential candidates to the New Hampshire forum and eight were represented. In addition to the candidates mentioned, Governor Jim Gilmore and surrogates for Secretary Hillary Clinton and Governor Martin O\u2019Malley were in attendance. We will continue to press the other candidates to weigh in on these issues.</i></p>", "<p>Jessica Nickel is the executive director of The Addiction Policy Forum.

There\u2019s the Michigan mother of four who started taking her daughter\u2019s Adderall prescription; the 16-year-old student who got hooked on pain pills after having surgery; former athletes who admit to taking dangerous cocktails of painkillers, tranquilizers, sexual dysfunction medications and supplements; and the suburban father who almost lost it all.</p>", "<p>In a surprising twist, Bell reveals his own struggles with prescription painkiller addiction in the film.</p>", "<p>\u201cI was never an addict, I was never addicted to anything \u2013 I was always somebody who was into sports \u2013 I was a power lifter \u2026 I was excited to go to the gym every day,\u201d Bell said. \u201cBut once I was hurt, and on these painkillers, everything started going slowly in reverse.\u201d</p>", "<p>By the time he finally sought help, Bell was taking up to 20 to 30 pain pills per day.</p>", "<p>\u201cIt\u2019s something that you have to come to terms with yourself, it\u2019s something that you have to want to quit and want to get off of,\u201d Bell said. \u201cIt\u2019s tough, it\u2019s a disease where it\u2019s a behavior problem \u2026 it\u2019s a brain chemistry problem \u2026 and the only way to fix it is to work on those behaviors and sort of modify those behaviors.\u201d</p>", "<p><b>A national epidemic</b></p>", "<p>The most abused prescription drugs fall under three categories: painkillers, tranquilizers and stimulants. In 2010, enough prescription painkillers were prescribed to medicate every American adult every four hours for a month, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.</p>", "<p>\u201cI think the biggest eye-opener was I always thought that like prescription drugs \u2026 were in the business of health and healing, and they wanted to get you better,\u201d said Bell. \u201cAnd I just realized that \u2026 people benefit and there\u2019s a lot of money being made off of keeping people on drugs.\u201d</p>", "<p>It\u2019s no secret the pharmaceutical industry rakes in billions of dollars producing drugs to treat symptoms and manage medical conditions. In fact, over the past decade, the Big Pharma raked in $711 billion. And in 2013, Bell points out, the industry spent upwards of $422,000 per United States Congressman to lobby their causes.</p>", "<p>Pharmaceutical executives and government officials Bell appealed to for his documentary denied his requests for interviews.</p>", "<p>And while he doesn\u2019t deny that the pharmaceutical industry is also responsible for many life-saving drugs on the market, Bell said he hopes his film will inspire people to be their own advocate when it comes to their health.</p>", "<p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a movie that\u2019s there to condemn the pharmaceutical industry or say \u2018If you get sick, don\u2019t go to the doctor,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI think [people] should go in and ask their doctor not what drug is right for them, but go in and ask their doctor why the doctor had put them on this specific drug.\u201d</p>", "<p>We\u2019re just taking too many pills, and we have to be careful, he added.</p>", "<p>For more information, visit <a href=\"http://www.prescriptionthugs.com\" target=\"_blank\">PrescriptionThugs.com</a>.</p>"]}

It will take at least several months to deploy a replacement carrier.<br> <br> Meanwhile, tensions continue to increase across the region, with Russian military involvement in Syria, ongoing fighting in Iraq, and a civil war in Yemen. In other words, just as the Middle East and North Africa are more volatile and uncertain than ever, America is dramatically reducing its visible military presence.<br> <br> How ironic that our withdrawn carrier was named for the president who urged America to \"Speak softly and carry a big stick.\" The Obama administration's motto appears to be the opposite of TR's -- \"Take your stick home and leave your allies to fend for themselves.\"<br> <br> The Rough Rider wasn't the first president who understood the importance of a strong peacetime military, even when budgets are tight. President George Washington made it a priority to invest in warships in the 1790s, when the new nation was still on shaky fiscal ground.<br> <br> As early as 1784, no longer protected by the Royal Navy, our new nation faced a threat from the Islamic states of North Africa -- Tripoli, Morocco, Tunis, and Algiers. They took advantage of America's lack of a navy, sending pirates to routinely hijack our merchant ships and enslave their crews. The radical leaders of those \"Barbary States\" demanded outrageous ransom and tribute payments, and felt no remorse for abusing or killing Christian sailors on religious grounds.<br> <br> President Washington used the new country's limited resources to build state-of-the-art warships like the USS <i>Constitution</i> (which you can still visit today in Boston Harbor). By 1801, when Thomas Jefferson became president, the U.S. Navy was strong enough that he could confront the extortion and barbarism of those Islamic states. Our success in the Barbary Wars (1801-15) would launch America on the path to future superpower status.</p>", "<p>Of course, it has always been expensive to build, maintain, and staff a powerful navy. In 1794, the Act to Provide a\u00a0Naval Armament appropriated the immense sum of $688,888. In 2016, our newest aircraft carrier, the USS <i>Gerald R. Ford</i>, will cost a staggering $13 billion. But just as George Washington couldn't allow the Barbary pirates to go unchecked, we can't allow our Navy to weaken to the point that no substitute carrier was available to relieve the <i>Theodore Roosevelt.</i></p>", "<p>Much has changed in 200 years, though not the bravery of our troops -- or\u00a0the mindset of Islamic extremists. In Jefferson's day, they refused to engage in diplomacy unless it was backed up by visible power. And today, how will we see ISIS respond to the\u00a0departure of our aircraft carrier, along with our premature withdrawal from Iraq?\u00a0</p>", "<p>We've been sporadically bombing ISIS for a year, with no visible progress. We bombed Libya and encouraged a revolution against Qaddafi, but then did nothing to fill the vacuum, leading to bigger problems. In the Obama era, half measures and mixed messages have damaged both our global reputation and our national security.<br> <br> Americans never want to go to war, but the best way to establish peace is to demonstrate that we're ready, willing, and able to defend our interests and allies. Washington, Jefferson, and James Madison -- the three presidents who drove our success in the Barbary Wars -- understood the importance of standing up to intimidation. Democrats like Harry Truman and JFK understood it. Why can't President Obama?<br> <br> Let's invest the resources to make sure our military is always fully prepared to do whatever our national security requires. And let's learn the lessons of history when it comes to what works and what doesn't in confronting radical Islamists.</p>", "<p>Brian Kilmeade currently serves as co-host of Fox News Channel's (FNC) <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/fox-and-friends/index.html\"><em>FOX &amp; Friends</em> (weekdays 6-9AM/ET)</a> alongside Steve Doocy and Elisabeth Hasselbeck.

Where you spend your money indicates what is important to your business. Investments made today can reveal what you believe about the future, while budget cuts show what has less value to you.</p>", "<p>That\u2019s why I think this Christmas season is a good time to reflect on our commitment to children and others in need, especially in our current moment where social issues are at the forefront of our national discussion. If where we spend our money indicates what we value, holiday spending suggests a lack of awareness and concern for some of the most urgent needs in our society and around the world.</p>", "<p>According to the National Retail Federation, <a href=\"https://nrf.com/media/press-releases/retailers-very-digital-holiday-season-according-nrf-survey\" target=\"_blank\">consumers will spend</a> on average $806 on food, gifts, and other holiday items this season, slightly more than last year. <a href=\"http://research.nrffoundation.com/Default.aspx?pg=9039#.VkTg8WSrT_Q\" target=\"_blank\">Surveys suggest</a> that will add up to $630 billion in spending over the holidays.</p>", "<p>That\u2019s an incredible amount of money, which could be used for other things. Budgets involve tradeoffs. At a time when <a href=\"http://www.nccp.org/topics/childpoverty.html\" target=\"_blank\">22 percent of American children</a> grow up in poverty and the world has more refugees than any other time in <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/06/18/world/unhcr-refugees-most-in-history/\" target=\"_blank\">recorded history</a>, how could some of that holiday spending be used to make the world a dramatically better place?</p>", "<p>It is surprising how much could be done with a small fraction of our Christmas consumerism. The average buyer will spend about <a href=\"http://research.nrffoundation.com/Default.aspx?pg=9003#.Vm8He9IrLIU\" target=\"_blank\">$53 on decorations alone</a>\u2014Christmas trees, lights, and candles. That\u2019s enough to provide <a href=\"http://donate.worldvision.org/ways-to-give/by-category/clean-water/water-for-one-person\" target=\"_blank\">one person with clean water</a> through <a href=\"http://www.worldvisiongifts.org/\" target=\"_blank\">World Vision\u2019s Gift Catalog</a>.</p>", "<p>Or, if we pooled our Christmas savings together and dedicated this year to making the world a better place, it would give us nearly $41.5 billion to do some good in the world. </p>", "<p>What could we do? And what could we do if we compounded that small sacrifice over the next decade? Let\u2019s look at the numbers.</p>", "<p>The <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jun/23/opinion/ed-food23\" target=\"_blank\">U.N. estimates</a> that it would cost about $30 billion a year for ten years to make the investments needed to end hunger. Because poor nutrition causes about half of deaths in children under five, according to the <a href=\"https://www.wfp.org/hunger/stats\" target=\"_blank\">World Food Program</a>, this would save about 3.1 million children every year. It would also enable the 795 million of the world\u2019s chronically hungry people to feed themselves\u2014without any outside help. We\u2019d still have another $11.5 billion to share.</p>", "<p>Around the world today, <a href=\"http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/160458/1/WHO_HTM_GMP_2015.2_eng.pdf?ua=1&amp;ua=1\" target=\"_blank\">someone dies of malaria nearly every minute</a>. Ending malaria would cost <a href=\"http://archiverbm.rollbackmalaria.org/gmap/gmap.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">$5.9 billion a year for six years</a>. That money would save millions of people from the crippling illness and boost local economies drained of productive workers. This would still leave more than $5 billion from our change-the-world fund.</p>", "<p>So, rather than spending it on scented candles, we could double our efforts to respond to the 4 million children, mothers, and fathers who have fled Syria. Right now, the U.N. High Commission for Refugees is <a href=\"http://data.unhcr.org/syrianrefugees/regional.php\" target=\"_blank\">asking for $4.3 billion</a> for its response. That appeal is only 50 percent funded, so refugees are receiving just $13 per month for food, and many other needs are unmet.</p>", "<p>This failure is pushing refugees farther and farther from Syria, into Europe and other Western countries where they risk their lives in dangerous border crossings. Becoming a <a href=\"http://www.worldvision.org/our-impact/syrian-refugees\" target=\"_blank\">World Vision Refugee Responder</a> would help provide the basics for refugees and allow Syrians to return home as soon as it\u2019s safe\u2014which they all want to do.</p>", "<p>So, by cutting back on our Christmas spending and redirecting that merry money to our global neighbors in need, we\u2019ve managed to end extreme hunger and malaria deaths while also giving the humanitarian agencies responding to the Syria crisis a huge boost.</p>", "<p>Just a fraction of our holiday spending\u2014$53 per holiday shopper\u2014could literally save millions of lives. That\u2019s an investment with an incredible return.</p>", "<p>It doesn\u2019t take much to change the world or save a life. It just requires making it a priority in our own budgets this Christmas season.</p>", "<p><i>Richard Stearns is president of World Vision US and author of \"</i><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Unfinished-Filling-Hole-Our-Gospel/dp/0529101149/\"><i>Unfinished: Filling the Hole in Our Gospel,</i></a><i>\" (Thomas Nelson 2014) \"</i><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Hole-Our-Gospel-Expect-Changed/dp/0849947006/\"><i>The Hole in Our Gospel: What Does God Expect of Us?

Students and parents alike fervently research and compare factors ranging from admission rates to extracurricular activities to ensure they make the \u201cright\u201d choice from a seemingly inexhaustible list of possibilities.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>", "<p>As the Superintendent of the United States Air Force Academy, I worry about how best to help students wrestling with the decision: should I, or should my child in the parent\u2019s case, consider attending the Air Force Academy?</p>", "<p>The answers are found both in the tangible benefits and distinguishing character of a Service Academy. To begin, the Air Force Academy is a competitive environment. Nearly all come to us as team captains, valedictorians, and student body presidents at their respective high schools. Over the next four years, however, they must learn to serve and lead in an environment in which everyone is a leader\u2026and everyone is a follower.\u00a0</p>", "<p>At the Academy, character is paramount \u2013 while they\u2019re evaluating our Academy we\u2019re evaluating them to determine if they have the honor and fortitude it takes to succeed at the Academy and serve in our Air Force. This begins with the cadet honor code: we will not lie, steal, or cheat, nor tolerate among us anyone who does.\u00a0 The Code is based on the enduring principles of honesty, respect, and fairness, and helps cultivate honor, integrity, and regard for human dignity -- core principles of the profession of arms.\u00a0 </p>", "<p>Our four-year curriculum and emphasis on character development is interwoven in all aspects of cadet life to create an atmosphere of trust and accountability amongst cadets and staff. \u00a0 \u00a0</p>", "<p>The military focus of the Air Force Academy adds another level of commitment, maturity and responsibility that we expect from our students. Our emphasis on impeccable character is why it becomes \u201cnews\u201d when an extremely small minority of our cadets does not meet our high standards. We hold ourselves to a higher standard.\u00a0 As such, we proactively address the difficult topics across our campus.\u00a0 </p>", "<p>As other institutions of higher learning struggle to tackle the growing campus sexual violence epidemic for example, <i>The Washington Post\u2019s</i> Nick Anderson highlighted the nation\u2019s military service academies\u2019 four year prevention training as the model for others to glean ideas from. We are not perfect, but as our reporting and prevalence rates continue to converge towards zero, our students are showing confidence in our leadership to maintain a safe, inclusive climate based on mutual respect regardless of race, gender, religion, or sexual orientation.\u00a0</p>", "<p>The impeccable character and personal achievements of our applicants produces an exceptionally well qualified and diverse pool of candidates. Consider this: while still in high school, one young man from the class of 2018 spent over a year of his after-school time building a 78-foot tall Hindu Temple.\u00a0 </p>", "<p>In another example of extraordinary accomplishments, a young lady from Colorado was the starting kicker on her high school football team. \u00a0The impressive list of academic and leadership accomplishments of each one of our 9000+ applicants is interwoven with personal stories of service, overcoming adversity, and grit in the face of challenges and difficulties.\u00a0</p>", "<p>The nominating process for the Air Force Academy generates a unique student body comprised of all U.S. states and territories, ethnicities, and economic backgrounds. This \u201celectoral college\u201d-style selection process not only reflects our national values, but also ingrains in each graduate a sense of respect and strength in diversity. \u00a0</p>", "<p>This diverse student body offering a variety of perspectives is leveraged to create a world-class education, which has been recognized by our \u201ctop-tier\u201d status in nearly every major national ranking. With full academic accreditation, the Academy offers a Bachelor of Science degree grounded in both STEM and the liberal arts. Through the Academy\u2019s 27 academic majors, 19 research centers, and two institutes, students have the freedom to pursue their passion and grow under the watchful leadership and mentorship of our world-class faculty.\u00a0</p>", "<p>Given the immense responsibility and immediate demand placed on our graduates, the Air Force Academy is more than a college.\u00a0 The Air Force Academy offers a full immersion in the Air Force\u2019s values and the modern profession of arms. Cadets will learn the principles of flight in our gliders and planes, operate and fly satellites, design and build cyber networks, and some will even test their courage and resolve through the Academy\u2019s solo freefall parachute program.\u00a0 </p>", "<p>Many will have opportunities to travel and study abroad, and all will test their grit, determination and warrior spirit through daily competition in sports and academia.\u00a0 \u00a0</p>", "<p>Competition is part of the fabric of every cadet. Every cadet at the Academy is a student-athlete. About 24% of our cadets will know the feeling of wearing Falcon blue and represent us in one of 27 NCAA division 1 sports.\u00a0 Some may represent us on one of 15 of the competitive clubs we offer. Nearly all cadets will have the opportunity to compete every semester in our many intramural competitions.\u00a0 </p>", "<p>Whether in the classroom, or \u201con the fields of friendly strife,\u201d competition is an indispensable element of the Academy experience. The will to win, teamwork, depending on others, risking failure, facing defeat with character \u2013 are critical leadership lessons our graduates will take into their futures.\u00a0</p>", "<p>Ultimately, the Academy is about graduating officers motivated to lead the United States Air Force in service to our nation. Our goal is to produce graduates who are exceptionally well-prepared to lead in a complex, challenging, technically sophisticated and ever-changing geopolitical environment. \u00a0</p>", "<p>As such, the Air Force Academy attracts a different type of student. Our Nation demands an unwavering commitment to lead and serve others.\u00a0 The education and leadership training they receive will crystalize their commitment to the core values of \u201cintegrity, service, and excellence\u201d and empower our graduates to become fit, ethically-based, service-minded officers prepared to lead in our Nation\u2019s Air Force and as leading citizens across our Nation.\u00a0\u00a0</p>", "<p>Lieutenant General Michelle D. Johnson is the Superintendent of the United States Air Force Academy, a four-year undergraduate institution of nearly 4,000 students that graduates officers ready to lead in the United States Air Force. \u00a0</p>", "<p>\u00a0</p>"]}

Trucks deliver nearly 70 percent of all domestic freight. And as our economy strengthens and consumer demand increases, policymakers must update existing laws to ensure the safest, most efficient, and most cost effective fleet on the roads.</p>", "<p>We have all seen twin or \u201cpup\u201d trailers on the road. Typically pulled in tandem, their 28-foot length was set by Department of Transportation regulations in 1982 \u2013 long before state of the art safety and emissions reduction equipment was developed and deployed. Unfortunately, this 30-year-old rule typically results in trailers filling up before the weight limit is met. In trucker jargon, they \u201ccube out\u201d before they \u201cweigh out.\u201d</p>", "<p>Members of Congress may soon consider an important proposal to allow a five-foot extension to 28-foot less-than-truckload (LTL) twin trailers, also known as \u201ctwin 28s.\u201d This small yet significant change would bring about dramatic improvements, including cost savings, increased highway safety, and benefits to the environment.\u00a0</p>", "<p>This modest increase would eliminate approximately 6.6 million truck trips per year, reduce carbon emissions by 4.4 billion pounds, save 204 million gallons of fuel, and eliminate 912 highway accidents annually, all without any change in the federal weight standard. In short, we estimate sanctioning 33-foot pup trailers would have the same overall effect as taking 1.5 million passenger cars off the road.</p>", "<p>Consider how we approach passenger vehicles.\u00a0 We have hundreds of miles of HOV lanes which are designed to encourage more efficient utilization of our passenger cars \u2013 but we actually have laws which limit the efficiency with which we deploy our fleet of trucks.</p>", "<p>The Transportation Research Board (TRB) of the National Academies recognized this issue more than a decade ago when calling for a five-foot extension for twin 28s. The logic was and still is simple: freight transportation is more productive if a single truck can haul more cargo.</p>", "<p>Poor utilization in truck capacity results in substantial fuel waste and increased levels of greenhouse gas emissions pumped into our atmosphere. It also increases congestion on our highways. According to the Federal Highway Administration miles traveled by vehicles on U.S. roads <a href=\"http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/travel_monitoring/tvt.cfm\" target=\"_blank\">reached an historic high</a>\u20141.5 trillion miles in the first half of 2015.\u00a0 By reducing the number of trucks on the road, we can help alleviate congestion and improve overall fuel economy.</p>", "<p>One group focused on improving freight transportation, the <a href=\"http://efficientandresponsible.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Coalition for Efficient &amp; Responsible Trucking</a> (CERT), also found a five-foot length increase could result in 18 percent more goods transported while reducing truck traffic by 1.3 billion miles per year.</p>", "<p>Longer pup trailers would not pose safety risks in stopping distance because the weight limit would remain the same. One <a href=\"http://efficientandresponsible.org/study-comparative-performance-evaluation-of-proposed-33-ft-double-trailers-combinations-with-existing-28-ft-double-trailers/\" target=\"_blank\">study</a> by commercial transportation expert John Woodrooffe at the University of Michigan asserts that twin 33s are \u201cinherently more stable\u201d and subsequently safer than twin 28s due to the longer wheelbase.</p>", "<p>A handful of states already allow 33-foot twins and have remarkable track records. On the nation\u2019s third-busiest toll road, the Florida Turnpike, twin 33s have traveled more than one million miles over the past five years without a single accident.</p>", "<p>There is no silver bullet for addressing shipping efficiency, climate change, and highway safety; however, twin 33-foot trailers move the needle closer and deserve support in Congress.\u00a0</p>", "<p>Carl Pope is the former Executive Director of the Sierra Club</p>", "<p>Mark Rosenker is the former chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and current senior adviser to the Coalition for Efficient and Responsible Trucking.</p>"]}

For example, Rep. Jim Jordan unearthed an email from Clinton to daughter Chelsea, penned while the violence still raged, describing the attack as perpetrated by an \u201cAl-Qaeda-like group,\u201d \u00a0and a next day conversation with\u00a0 the Egyptian Prime Minister admitting \u201cWe know the attack in Libya had nothing to do with the film. It was a planned attack, not a protest.\u201d\u00a0 All the while, Clinton was telling the world and the victims\u2019 relatives an anti Islamic video was to blame.\u00a0</p>", "<p>Unfortunately, crucial truths remain undisclosed or so botched by the Committee it was worthless to raise them. I know these truths because I have long represented former Tripoli DCM Greg Hicks, whose May 2013 House testimony was quoted extensively throughout the hearing. Three truths not revealed:</p>", "<p><u>1. The number of security personnel available to Ambassador Stevens dropped from 38 in May 2012, when he was sworn in, to 9, when he went to Benghazi</u>. It is a very simple concept, a loss of 29 security personnel during a time when there were hundreds of requests to Clinton\u2019s State Department for increased security. Hicks published an Op-Ed for the Wall Street Journal in 2014 describing the bases and process for this reduction.\u00a0 Yet, not one Member asked her for that information.</p>", "<p><u>By law, Clinton was required to waive the security in Benghazi and could not delegate that decision.</u></p>", "<p>Repeatedly, the Committee allowed Clinton to claim she had nothing to do with security in Libya.\u00a0 Such requests \u201cwere rightly handled by the security professionals\u2026. I did not see them.\u00a0 I did not approve them.\u00a0 I did not deny them.\u201d \u00a0However, the Secure Embassy Construction and Counterterrorism Act of 1999, SECCA, passed in the wake of the 1998 Embassy twin bombings in Africa when Bill Clinton was president, required her to rule on the substandard security in Benghazi. \u00a0</p>", "<p>2. As with Benghazi, an Accountability Review Board (ARB) for each African bombing was convened.\u00a0 The ARBs faulted the State Department for no accountability for the security in Kenya and Tanzania, and made specific recommendations for future Secretaries of State.\u00a0 But Congress went further.\u00a0 SECCA requires the Secretary to waive any situation where all the embassy buildings are not housed in one facility, as was the case with Benghazi, and states that the decision <u>cannot</u> be delegated.\u00a0\u00a0</p>", "<p>For a long time, the Committee seemed to be aware only of the ARB language, quoting it extensively while ignoring the statutory mandate.\u00a0 Finally, during the dinner hour, Rep. Susan Brooks broached the issue but clearly did not understand the law.\u00a0 When Sec. Clinton demurred she did not sign a waiver because the Benghazi consulate was \u201ctemporary,\u201d Brooks abandoned the subject. \u00a0But Brooks\u2019 acquiescence missed the point of the law.\u00a0 It was intended to cover such \u201ctemporary\u201d facilities.\u00a0</p>", "<p>The Benghazi ARB admitted in its 2013 report that there had been a waiver, describing the Benghazi compound as being \u201cexcepted\u201d under the law. \u00a0\u00a0Was no one on the Committee aware of that fact?\u00a0 An obvious follow up question: \u201cBut Ms. Clinton, who did the ARB refer to when saying Benghazi had been excepted?\u201d \u00a0And then: \u00a0\u201cIf you did not sign the waiver, who did?\u201d But the Committee let her escape an admission of violating the law by falsely claiming it did not cover a temporary facility.</p>", "<p><u>3. Ambassador Stevens was in Benghazi in September 2012 because Clinton requested him to recommend a permanent status for Benghazi. </u>\u00a0\u00a0</p>", "<p>On the day she swore Stevens in as Ambassador, Clinton requested him to go to Benghazi to determine whether it could be a permanent post.\u00a0 </p>", "<p>The report had to be written before the end of the fiscal year, September 30, because funds had to be requested.\u00a0 Moreover, Clinton was planning a trip to exploit that decision later in 2012.\u00a0 The ARB tried to conceal Clinton\u2019s role, falsely claiming that Stevens went there \u201cindependently\u201d of Washington, when it had been told the truth by Hicks.\u00a0 </p>", "<p>Throughout the hearing, Clinton\u2019s attitude about Stevens was that he went of his own accord \u201cHe did not need permission to travel.\u201d Yet, her request was the reason for his trip and its timing.</p>", "<p><i>Victoria Toensing is a former Chief Counsel for the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and former Deputy Assistant Attorney General, U.S. Department of Justice, where among other assignments she created the anti-terrorism section.

At a spry 91-years, the former president remains active, even continuing his service work with Habitat for Humanity. </p>", "<p>Thanks to the marvels of modern medicine, he can expect to enjoy more good health and time with his family despite having just undergone cancer treatment for a second time.<br> <br> While President Carter's restored health is cause for celebration, tens of thousands of other Americans with terminal illnesses will not have this happy ending. And federal laws bear some blame.<br> <br> According to President Obama\u2019s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, it takes 14 years to bring a new drug to market in the U.S.\u2014 up from eight years in the 1960s. Even the so-called \"accelerated approval\" of drugs often works at a snail\u2019s pace.<br> <br> Consider Keytruda, the cutting-edge treatment credited with eliminating President Carter\u2019s cancer. The FDA claimed it approved the drug in a matter of months. When we went back into the FDA records and calculated the <i>actual</i> time it took to approve the drug, from the filing of an Individual New Drug application to final approval, we found that it actually took years.<br> <br> The FDA said it took 9 months and 13 days to first approve this treatment in 2014. But, in reality, the total approval time was 4 years, 8 months, and 25 days. How many Americans could Keytruda have saved during that four-year wait?<br> <br> Promising new drugs are coming online too slow, especially for patients who have run out of options. But patients are finding a promising new avenue for hope in \u201cRight to Try\u201d laws that have been adopted in 24 states.<br> <br> Under these laws, patients who have exhausted standard treatment options have the right, under the care of their physician, to try to save their lives with investigational treatments. To qualify, a drug must have completed basic safety testing and continue to be under study at the FDA. In practical terms, this means promising drugs like Keytruda\u2014that eventually make it to market\u2014can start helping patients and saving lives years sooner.<br> <br> The FDA is a federal agency, so fixing this problem should be Congress\u2019s responsibility. But for decades, gridlock in Washington has blocked a solution. Multiple bills have been introduced in Congress to expand access for terminal patients to drugs stuck in the FDA pipeline, but most have gone nowhere.</p>", "<p>Seeing the inaction on Capitol Hill, the Cancer Treatments Centers for America (CTCA) came to us for help. They wanted to know if there was anything the states could do to help those dying from terminal diseases access innovative treatments that could save their lives. \u00a0</p>", "<p>Then CTCA CEO-Steve Bonner recalls, \u201cI just asked the question: You\u2019re talking about years and people with late-stage cancer don\u2019t have years. So is there a possible exception we could carve out here for cancer patients?\u201d</p>", "<p>As I listened to Bonner and his colleagues, I immediately thought of my uncle Kenny. He died when I was about four years old from Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma\u2014a form of cancer for which there are now multiple treatments with very high cure rates.</p>", "<p>He was my father\u2019s only brother, and I distinctly remember my dad saying, when I was growing up, that Uncle Kenny had died just months before a new treatment was approved. At that moment it hit me: If Kenny had been allowed to try that treatment earlier, my father might still have his brother, and my cousins might still have their father.</p>", "<p>The idea that the federal government was standing in the way of people fighting for their lives was infuriating. It\u2019s one thing for people to die because science has not come up with a treatment yet. It\u2019s quite another for someone to die when a treatment exists, but a patient can\u2019t get access to it because of governmental obstacles.</p>", "<p>If Washington will not fix the problem, we will.<br> </p>", "<p>Darcy Olsen, president of the Goldwater Institute, is the author of \u201cThe Right to Try\u201d which was recently published by HarperCollins.</p>"]}

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., perfectly embody the polarization that prevents Congress from getting anything done on the nation\u2019s most pressing issues, from immigration to stopping gun massacres to fighting the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS).</p>", "<p>This dysfunctional Congress deserves its dismal 13 percent approval rating from the American people. The Republican majorities in the House and Senate reached a new nadir in broken politics by inviting a foreign leader, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, to use the Congress as a setting to disrespect the American president back in March. They acted without first consulting with the White House.\u00a0</p>", "<p>And then there was the refusal to hold confirmation hearings on the president\u2019s nominees for judicial posts or to the Foreign Service.</p>", "<p>Congressional Republicans have made it their everyday practice to obstruct initiatives from the twice-elected leader of the nation. That includes their recent undercutting of any efforts to deal with global warming, which are being negotiated by the president and more than a hundred other world leaders.</p>", "<p>The GOP antipathy toward President Obama is not new, however. The bigger change is the out-of-control elbowing inside the Republican tent that came to define the year on Capitol Hill.</p>", "<p>Republicans in the House successfully launched a coup earlier this year against then-Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), forcing out a man who is by any measure a strong conservative but still not conservative enough for the party\u2019s far right. The same right wing then derailed Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) because they saw him as too close to Boehner.</p>", "<p>The eventual winner after several weeks of embarrassing party infighting was the 2012 GOP vice presidential candidate and former Ways and Means committee chair, Ryan. But Ryan won without winning the official endorsement of the rebellious Freedom Caucus, who dictated Boehner\u2019s departure.</p>", "<p>All this led the new Speaker, in his very first speech as the top Republican in the House, to stare failure in the face.\u00a0</p>", "<p>\u201cLet\u2019s be frank: The House is broken,\u201d said Speaker Ryan. \u201cWe are not solving problems. We are adding to them.\u201d</p>", "<p>And that is from a loyal conservative.\u00a0</p>", "<p>The real story on Ryan\u2019s elevation is that he is by far the most conservative Speaker in recent times. His voting record is far to the right of Boehner and other GOP Speakers of the current era, from Newt Gingrich (Ga.) to Denny Hastert (Ill.).</p>", "<p>Don\u2019t forget: Ryan rose to prominence as the defiant right-winger who proposed, as top Republican on the budget committee, to change Medicare from a guaranteed health care program for the elderly to a limited, untested voucher plan. He also backed massive tax breaks for the wealthy and large corporations.</p>", "<p>In almost 17 years in Congress, Ryan has been a reliable opponent of abortion rights and gay rights, and he supported President George W. Bush\u2019s push to privatize Social Security.</p>", "<p>Despite that very conservative record, the new Speaker had to deflect charges from the Freedom Caucus, conservative talk radio, websites and bloggers that he is just one more establishment Republican. That outrageous\u00a0indictment fits with a Pew Research poll from May\u00a0that found 75 percent of Republican voters want Congressional Republicans to obstruct, defy and challenge President Obama more frequently.</p>", "<p>The GOP\u2019s deference to the far right has resulted in a backlash from liberal Democrats \u2013 around the nation and on Capitol Hill \u2014 that finds expression in the presidential bid of Sanders.</p>", "<p>Last year, my top member of Congress leapt to prominence on the power of the same backlash: Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). She surfed a tide of populist anger among liberals over income inequality and the bailout of big banks and Wall Street.</p>", "<p>This year, the 74-year-old Sanders succeeded in channeling the same energy outside the halls of Congress. Democratic voters still strongly back former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for the party\u2019s 2016 nomination. But the unleashed, defiant roar of the party in 2015 can be heard at Sanders\u2019s political rallies.</p>", "<p>He has been a political sensation, all year long, in every corner of the nation. He attracts energized, loud crowds by identifying the Republican majority in Congress as the tool of big business and extremely wealthy Americans including Charles and David Koch, and other plutocrats.

For many of the more than 20 million Americans\u2014one out of every 10 adults\u2014who suffer from chronic kidney disease (CKD), that life isn\u2019t theoretical. It\u2019s their daily reality.</p>", "<p>But all taxpayers, not just those with kidney problems, have a reason to support a drastic increase in government funding for research: We, the taxpayers, are spending tens of billions each year to treat patients with kidney disease\u2014the nation\u2019s ninth-leading cause of death\u2014and yet we are investing very little in trying to cure it.\u00a0 \u00a0</p>", "<p>Every year, the federal government spends $80 billion through Medicare alone to treat CKD (and the real cost to taxpayers is much higher when we count spending through dozens of other programs), but the National Institutes of Health are able to devote less than 0.8% of that amount to research to prevent or cure it.\u00a0\u00a0</p>", "<p>To make matters worse, the costs of treating CKD are increasing rapidly. Between 2008 and 2012, Medicare spending on CKD patients increased at a rate almost five times as fast as the rest of the program and now makes up one-fifth of all Medicare Parts A and B expenditures. Costs increase as patients progress through the disease, with a dialysis patient requiring nearly $90,000 per year. This makes end stage renal disease one of the most expensive chronic diseases.\u00a0</p>", "<p>Put another way, every patient kept off of dialysis saves taxpayers $250,000.</p>", "<p>If we fail to solve this problem, then by 2030, one out of every six American adults will have CKD.</p>", "<p>Take for example the particular form of CKD that one of us (Bill) inherited from his father. The NIH spends $41 million on polycystic kidney disease (PKD) research per year. Having sent 5,000 patients to the transplant list, PKD costs taxpayers 50 times more than that\u2014 $2 billion\u2014annually via Medicaid and Medicare alone.</p>", "<p>Of course, this total does not include the lost productivity of workers forced to retire early. Only 20 percent of the people on dialysis of working age have jobs. Nor does it account for the toll of the disease on caretakers, nor the devastation that too many early deaths wreak on families.</p>", "<p>Bill\u2019s cousin Michael, a successful sales executive suffering from PKD, was torn from his family at the age of 35, leaving two young children to grow up without a father.</p>", "<p>A treatment to slow the progression of PKD may now be close at hand. Thanks to research funded in part by the NIH and in part by the PKD Foundation, Bill is taking an experimental drug already approved for use in the European Union, the U.K., Japan and Canada. With just a little more spent on PKD research, even better treatments could soon follow, saving billions for years to come.\u00a0</p>", "<p>PKD is just one of more than 200 costly kidney diseases. For each, research is severely underfunded. An additional $1.5 billion over ten years<i>\u00a0</i>could significantly reduce the $80 billion taxpayers are paying each year through Medicare to manage them. Simply delaying the onset of such illnesses by a few years would save American taxpayers billions of dollars annually\u2014forever.</p>", "<p>It is hard to imagine a smarter, and more compassionate, fiscal policy.</p>", "<p>Kidney disease, of course, represents just one of many debilitating conditions for which the NIH funds crucial basic research. Heart disease, cancer, stroke, arthritis, Alzheimer\u2019s\u2014swifter progress toward cures would benefit all of those who suffer from these terrible diseases, to say nothing of taxpayers at large.</p>", "<p>We have proposed doubling the NIH budget to $60 billion and reforming it to reduce bureaucracy, focus resources on basic research for the most expensive and prevalent health problems, and give the director more flexibility to redirect funds where they are urgently needed.\u00a0</p>", "<p>Leaders in both the House and Senate have taken important steps in this direction. The new budget deal\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/12/18/house-oks-year-end-budget-deal-sends-legislation-to-senate.html\">passed by the House</a>\u00a0would boost NIH\u2019s budget by $2 billion, the largest increase the NIH has received in 12 years.

"<p>America\u2019s crime rate has indeed fallen substantially in recent decades, but this is due in large part to a paradigm shift in what it means to be \u201ctough on crime.\u201d </p>", "<p>We can agree that keeping serious criminals in prison is an effective means of preserving public safety, but we must also recognize that the axiom of \u201cputting people in jail and throwing away the key\u201d does not apply to all offenders universally, and can actually be counterproductive. </p>", "<p>Incarcerating non-violent offenders in the same population as more dangerous criminals has the effect of inculcating the former into a culture of criminality common among the latter, making them more of a risk to public safety upon release than when they originally went in.</p>", "<p>\u201cTough on crime\u201d policies, particularly mandatory sentences, tend to set such circumstances in stone, and vitiates the possibility of seeking out alternative, evidence-based programs that can divert amenable offenders into treatment. </p>", "<p>Such programs are more cost-effective, and most importantly, have been proven to reduce the likelihood of recidivism. </p>", "<p>Recognition of this has been just one instance of states taking \u201ccrime more seriously,\u201d and indeed, being\u00a0<i>smarter</i>\u00a0on crime. </p>", "<p>There\u2019s nothing conservative about allowing ourselves to become so inured to a \u201ctough on crime\u201d frame of mind that we would abandon tested alternatives that can yield better outcomes.</p>", "<p>Consider Texas. Since 2005, Texas has created drug courts, instituted swift and certain sanctions for those in violation of their terms of release, and incentivized offenders to comply with terms of probation. </p>", "<p>As a result of these reforms and others, Texas has realized a reduction in its incarceration rate of 12% since 2009, and its lowest crime rate since 1968\u2014at the same time, it should be noted, as reserving mandatory sentences for only the most violent or repeat offenders. </p>", "<p>Other conservative states have passed their own similar reforms in the last decade, and the Senate\u2019s bill draws on these lessons for the federal system.</p>", "<p>It\u2019s worthwhile at this point to highlight an important misconception among those against reform: namely, that increased incarceration translates directly to lower crime rates. </p>", "<p>While this may be true to an extent, studies have shown that only about 25% of our recent crime rate reduction can be attributed to imprisoning more people. </p>", "<p>In fact, according to the Pew Trusts, those states that have <i>reduced</i> incarceration have <a href=\"https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__www.pewtrusts.org_en_multimedia_data-2Dvisualizations_2015_imprisonment-2Dcrime-2Drates-2Dfell-2Din-2D30-2Dstates-2Dover-2Dfive-2Dyears&amp;d=CwMFAg&amp;c=RAhzPLrCAq19eJdrcQiUVEwFYoMRqGDAXQ_puw5tYjg&amp;r=Et5YdIyy-C0W2BTIH62ehqB-arbKzolU7qDKR2mCSoY&amp;m=gQWqn3fKNtC8WQsMJCq-WZ0WKsS_fy-esmKp3vMheK0&amp;s=TDMD-BOMrTvb75Hpd_goOt1hB_5-_yYyLtr3dYaOZsE&amp;e=\" target=\"_blank\">enjoyed the largest concomitant reductions</a>\u00a0in their crime rates. Therefore, attempts to draw any meaningful correlation between the two is perilous, particularly when arguing that curbing mandatory sentencing will yield higher instances of crime.</p>", "<p>Provisions including retroactivity where mandatory sentences have been shortened could indeed result in altered sentences, but such reductions would not be automatic, coming only after a court has considered various sentencing factors, including risk of recidivism, danger to the public, and prison misconduct. </p>", "<p>In fact, every provision of the federal Senate bill that reduces a mandatory sentence is coupled with judicial oversight. Therefore, any suggestion that Congress would be \u201cletting criminals out of prison\u201d haphazardly is without merit.</p>", "<p>The federal prison population has exploded by nearly 800 percent since 1980, fueled in large part by mandatory sentences that lock in definite stays behind bars, and don\u2019t allow for judicial discretion that treat cases on an individualized basis. </p>", "<p>Even without mandatory sentences, judges are still capable of levying tough penalties for serious offenses\u2014and just as in states like Texas that have \u201ctough on crime\u201d reputations, this can be done without jeopardizing public safety.</p>", "<p>Ken Cuccinelli is the former attorney general for Virginia, and a signatory to the Right on Crime statement of principles.</p>"]}

The regulation would permit, but not require, charitable organizations to file a new, separate information return (in addition to the Form 990) to substantiate covered contributions. The new informational return would require the charity to collect an individual donor\u2019s name, address, and Social Security number, and provide a copy to the donor.</p>", "<p>We have filed <a href=\"http://media.aclj.org/pdf/20151214----Comments-to-IRS-Opposing-New-CWA-Regs_Redacted.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">public comments</a> with the IRS opposing this new regulation. It\u2019s a bad idea for a number of reasons. Here are three:</p>", "<p><b>1. On its website, the IRS advises consumers and taxpayers to provide their SSN (or TIN) only when \u201cabsolutely necessary.\u201d\u00a0 </b>Even as a voluntary system, the proposed regulations essentially require charities to ask donors to give out their SSNs when it is not absolutely necessary. Voluntary and \u201cabsolutely necessary\u201d are diametrically opposed to each other and the IRS should not create a system which provides such inconsistent advice. Doing so undermines consumer and taxpayer protections, and erodes public confidence in both charities and the IRS.\u00a0</p>", "<p><b>2. Requests for SSNs are likely to result in reduced charitable giving.</b> When confronted with requests for SSNs for contributions exceeding $250, donors will logically be unwilling to contribute more than $250.</p>", "<p><b>3. Concerns about identity theft are very real and a significant reason this new regulation should not be adopted.</b> Just this year, hackers have accessed sensitive employee data at the federal Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), two sophisticated organizations with the resources to protect against identity theft and sensitive information. Hackers were nevertheless able to breach their fire-walls and steal the information of millions of federal employees and contractors. If OPM and the CIA (among countless other governmental and private organizations) cannot protect against such security breaches and theft, it seems particularly ill-advised to set up a system that has charities collecting, storing, and (hopefully) protecting SSNs.</p>", "<p>Further, the IRS acknowledged in its notice, the present system \u201cworks effectively, with minimal burden on donors and donees.\u201d That being the case, there seems little need to create a new, optional, parallel reporting regime that would implement additional administrative burdens on charities.</p>", "<p>And, don\u2019t be fooled by the tax agency\u2019s assertion that this new regulation simply would be \u201cvoluntary\u201d \u2013 not mandatory. As the <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-irs-targets-political-donors-1450225321\" target=\"_blank\">Wall Street Journal</a> points out, this is really just another tactic for the IRS to get a foot in the door:</p>", "<p>\u201cWhile the IRS says the rule is \u2018voluntary,\u2019 in government that\u2019s often a prelude to compulsory. The legitimate fear in the nonprofit world, on the right and left, is that this is a first step toward making such donor lists mandatory, and then applying the requirement to every nonprofit\u2014including the conservative social-welfare organizations that the IRS helped to shut down in the 2012 presidential election.\u201d</p>", "<p>That is absolutely correct.</p>", "<p>In fact, we\u2019re still in <a href=\"http://media.aclj.org/pdf/second-amended-complaint-filed-redacted.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">litigation</a> against the IRS \u2013 representing dozens of conservative and Tea Party groups who were unconstitutionally singled out by the IRS because of their conservative beliefs. Even though this targeting scandal was revealed years ago, the IRS continues its targeting.</p>", "<p>Of the 38 clients we currently represent, two are still awaiting a response from the IRS on their applications -- Albuquerque Tea Party has been waiting six years and Unite in Action has been waiting for more than three years.</p>", "<p>Nearly <a href=\"http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=IRS-2015-0049-0001\" target=\"_blank\">35,000 comments</a> have been submitted to the IRS about the proposed regulation \u2013 most of them appear to be in <a href=\"http://thehill.com/regulation/finance/263530-irs-rule-could-hurt-non-profit-donations\" target=\"_blank\">opposition</a> to the new rule.

Private charities are often more cost conscious, responsive, better targeted, and invite greater citizen participation than government outlay programs. The deduction also recognizes that people contributing to charities are transferring part of their incomes to others, which reduces their ability to pay taxes out of what remains.\u201d</p>", "<p>As we approach 2016 many candidates are advancing their tax plans and some incorporate the elimination of all deductions including the charitable deduction. These plans must be scrutinized and understood in the macro and micro of their economic cause and effect.</p>", "<p>In January of 2014, I was heartened when a bipartisan group of U.S. Senators banded together to keep the charitable deduction out of tax reform legislation. The Hill reported the following on this effort: A coalition of 35 senators, 17 Republicans and 16 Democrats, argued that the cherished deduction is not a loophole but \u201ca lifeline for millions of Americans in need.\u201d The letter was noteworthy for the senators who agreed to back it.

But the broad group of senators contended that the charitable tax deduction is unique and should be left untouched as part of any overhaul effort.</p>", "<p>They argue that, if Congress were to trim the deduction or eliminate it altogether, it might raise governmental revenue, but at the expense of millions, who rely on charitable giving, incentivized by the tax code, to provide support.</p>", "<p>\u00a0\u201cThe charitable deduction is unique. It is the only provision that encourages taxpayers to give away a portion of their income for the benefit of others,\u201d the senators wrote. \u201cAnalysis has repeatedly shown that proposals to cut, cap, or limit the charitable deduction could cause charitable donations to decline by billions of dollars annually.</p>", "<p>\u00a0\u201cWe believe the federal government must affirm its long-standing dedication to encouraging private acts of charity and compassion, especially when our charities and the people they serve are facing so many challenges,\u201d they added.</p>", "<p>Backers of the deduction cheered the letter, calling it a \u201cclear signal\u201d on the importance of the charitable deduction.</p>", "<p>I could not agree more. As someone who founded one on America\u2019s and the world\u2019s most successful not-for- profits -- Susan G.

A federal lawsuit has been filed to remove our national motto \u2013 \u2018In God We Trust\u2019 \u2013 from the currency. If this sounds familiar, it should. This is not the first time that challenge has been made.</p>", "<p>In fact, dedicated atheist Michael Newdow, who is representing 41 plaintiffs in this suit filed in Ohio, is a veteran litigator who repeatedly has gone to court to remove \u2018In God We Trust\u2019 from our culture. More about that in a moment.</p>", "<p>In this new <a href=\"https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/2681345/Currency-Lawsuit.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">filing</a>, Newdow \u2013 and those he represents \u2013 are apparently so offended by the use of the word \u201cGod\u201d \u2013 that they can\u2019t even bring themselves to spell it out in the lawsuit. The hundreds of references to \u201cGod\u201d in the lawsuit are spelled \u201cG-d.\u201d</p>", "<p>The national motto concerns them so much that a key part of their legal argument in asking the court to remove \u2018In God We Trust\u2019 from the currency, is that the phrase violates the separation of church and state and creates a pro-Christian, and anti-atheist sentiment in the nation.</p>", "<p>\u201cThe \u2018In G-d We Trust\u2019 phrase has continued to be a tool used to perpetuate favoritism for (Christian) Monotheism,\u201d the suit contends. \u201cIt has also continued to perpetuate anti-Atheistic bias.\u201d</p>", "<p>This argument is deeply flawed and ridiculous. It simply represents another attempt to attack our religious heritage.</p>", "<p>The truth is the fate of this new lawsuit is likely to end up the way earlier attempts to remove the national motto did. It is destined to fail.</p>", "<p>Here\u2019s why.</p>", "<p>Our nation\u2019s history is replete with examples of acknowledgment of religious belief in the public sector, and the Supreme Court has repeatedly referenced the national motto as a legitimate expression of our religious heritage.</p>", "<p>The Establishment Clause was never intended as a guarantee that a person will not be exposed to religion or religious symbols on public property, and the Supreme Court has rejected previous attempts to eradicate all symbols of this country\u2019s religious heritage from the public\u2019s view.</p>", "<p>Whether it is in the national motto, the Pledge of Allegiance, patriotic music, or the nation\u2019s founding documents; such references are wholly consistent with the First Amendment.</p>", "<p>It\u2019s very likely this new suit will be rejected by the courts \u2013 adding to a long list of failures for Newdow.</p>", "<p>In 2013, a federal district court in New York rejected the very same argument in a case in which Newdow was directly involved \u2013 a case in which we filed a critical amicus brief on behalf of 41 members of Congress and nearly 88,000 Americans. In dismissing the case, a federal judge correctly concluded that the national motto <a href=\"http://aclj.org/american-heritage/victory-in-god-we-still-trust\" target=\"_blank\">\u201cdoes not violate the Establishment Clause.\u201d</a></p>", "<p>Newdow has also gone after the use of \u201cunder God\u201d in the Pledge of Allegiance.

Misguided, but persistent.</p>", "<p>While lawsuits like this are really just a nuisance, they must be taken seriously. You really never know how a court will interpret these flawed arguments.</p>", "<p>And that is exactly why, once again, we are mobilizing. We will defend the national motto again.

Wade</i>. This year\u2019s theme is \u201cPro-Life and Pro-Woman Go Hand in Hand.\u201d Why?</p>", "<p>Planned Parenthood and other abortion proponents falsely claim <i>they</i> are for mothers while <i>we</i> at the March for Life are for babies. No. We are marching for the unbreakable <i>bond of love</i> between mothers <i>and</i> babies.</p>", "<p>A pregnant woman and her baby are not radically separate individuals with isolated human rights \u201cat war\u201d with one another. A woman and her baby are a \u201cunity of two persons\u201d interconnected in love with everyone and everything. Whatever harms the baby harms the mother, whatever harms the mother harms the baby, and whatever harms either of them harms us all.</p>", "<p><i>Roe v. Wade</i> has enshrined into the law of our nation the false and damaging notion that you can snap the bond of love between a mother and her baby without consequences. </p>", "<p>That\u2019s simply untrue. You can gnaw at that bond of love through abortion. You can visibly and physically severe the mother\u2019s life from the life of her baby.\u00a0 But invisibly, in the human heart where the hidden truth lies, that silent bond of love remains unbroken and eternal.</p>", "<p>We are all well aware of the false rhetorical slogan claiming that the prolife movement has declared a \u201cwar on women.\u201d Nothing could be further from the truth. We in the prolife movement have never declared a war. We are defending <i>the bond of love</i> between a mother <i>and</i> her child.</p>", "<p><i>Roe</i> was never pro-woman. It was poorly conceived from the very beginning. </p>", "<p>Nearly all of the historical, medical, and legal arguments Justice Harry Blackmun used to support the <i>Roe</i> holdings have been subjected to intense scholarly criticism. </p>", "<p>Many of those arguments were devised by NARAL co-founder Lawrence Lader and NARAL attorney Cyril Chestnut Means, Jr. Lader was a master propagandist whose highly persuasive book <i>Abortion</i> was thick with half-truth, limited truth, and truth out of context. </p>", "<p>Means literally invented his own abortion \u201cfacts,\u201d observes Villanova University law-history professor Joseph Dellapenna in \"Dispelling the Myths of Abortion History.\" Yet in <i>Roe,</i> Blackmun cited Lader\u2019s \"Abortion\"<i> </i>book seven times and Means\u2019 papers another seven times. </p>", "<p>Women deserve so much more; at the very least they deserve the truth.</p>", "<p>Even Blackmun himself told the Washington Post in February of 1974 that the <i>Roe v. Wade</i> ruling could one day be regarded as \u201cas one of the worst mistakes in the court\u2019s history, or one of its great decisions, a turning point.\u201d</p>", "<p>Sadly, as we consider the United States today, we now know how damaging the decision has been. </p>", "<p>We have lost over 57 million Americans to abortion since <i>Roe </i>and many, many women regret choosing abortion. Some of these women who regret their abortions will be sharing their testimonies in front of the Supreme Court at the end of the March for Life.</p>", "<p>When we, as Americans, pledge that we are \u201c<i>One</i> nation, under God, <i>indivisible</i>, with liberty and justice for <i>all</i>,\u201d we are declaring the truth that we are all interconnected. </p>", "<p>We believe in liberty and justice for <i>all</i>, even the smallest person in the womb. And we believe that we cannot pit one human\u2019s \u201crights\u201d against another human\u2019s \u201crights.\u201d </p>", "<p>Human rights are not isolated, private, and \u201cat war\u201d with each other. <i>Human rights are indivisible</i>.</p>", "<p>No woman in her right mind chooses an abortion. Abortion is nearly always a choice born of fear. As pro-Life feminist Frederica Mathewes-Green famously put it: \"No one wants an abortion as she wants an ice-cream cone or a Porsche. She wants an abortion as an animal, caught in a trap, wants to gnaw off its own leg.\"</p>", "<p>As the grassroots March for Life continues strong into its 43<sup>rd</sup> year, we work for the day when no pregnant mother feels compelled to choose an abortion. </p>", "<p>We march toward that new day when all thoughtful Americans support the \"unity of two\"--both the mother <i>and</i> her baby--and when freedom for <i>all</i> at last reigns over our land.</p>", "<p>Jeanne Mancini is President of the March for Life Education and Defense Fund. \u00a0</p>", "<p>Sue Ellen Browder is author of \u201cSubverted: How I Helped the Sexual Revolution Hijack the Women's Movement.\u201d \u00a0</p>"]}

It swept away the laws of all fifty states, inventing a right to abortion that could not be found in the Constitution.</p>", "<p>Even many pro-choice legal scholars have criticized that decision, admitting that the Constitution clearly allows states to enact protections for the unborn. And so Friday\u2019s March for Life is also a march for democracy: for the right to use democratic means to advance justice.</p>", "<p>I applaud the marchers, and even more I applaud their noble cause.</p>", "<p>I strongly believe that we should build a culture that respects the dignity of all human life from conception to natural death.</p>", "<p>As president, I would move, through patient persuasion, toward protecting more and more unborn children from abortion. Many of my fellow citizens disagree with that goal, of course, but I think most Americans can agree that we should at least protect unborn children at 20 weeks of development, when they may be able to feel pain.</p>", "<p>In an age when parents and grandparents post sonogram pictures of their unborn children to their Facebook pages, and modern medicine allows doctors to save premature babies born earlier than we ever thought imaginable, most people understand that these are young lives worthy of our protection. Nearly all European countries protect children at this late stage of development, and it is time we joined them.</p>", "<p>I believe, as well, that taxpayers should not be the largest source of funding for the organization that performs the more abortions than any other entity in our country.</p>", "<p>When I am president, we will reinstate the rule that family-planning money goes to organizations that do not perform abortions. Americans who oppose Planned Parenthood should not be forced to fund it.</p>", "<p>I used persuasion and incremental change to build a culture of life in Florida. We banned partial-birth abortion and required parental notification before minors could have abortions. We forced abortion clinics to abide by basic health and safety standards for women.\u00a0 </p>", "<p>We required that women considering abortions after their first trimesters be allowed to review ultrasound images. </p>", "<p>We supported crisis pregnancy centers, so that pregnant women in difficult circumstances\u2014too often lacking support from the fathers of their children\u2014would have the material and emotional help they need. Some of the funding for these groups came from Florida\u2019s \u201cChoose Life\u201d license plates: something I am proud to say I was the first governor to sign a law to allow. We ended Medicaid funding for abortion.</p>", "<p>All of these measures faced serious opposition, but had strong public support. And they helped us bring the abortion rate in our state down twice as fast as the national average. Meanwhile we more than doubled the number of adoptions in our state. And I ensured that we defunded Planned Parenthood in our state, too.</p>", "<p>On all these issues, Hillary Clinton has a different view. When Americans from both parties and both sides of the abortion debate came together to ban partial-birth abortion as a truly barbaric procedure unworthy of our country, she defended it. She said that the voters had no right to decide the issue.</p>", "<p>Today she opposes banning late-term abortions, again siding with the most extreme advocates of abortion. It is a stance that has recently won her the endorsement of the two biggest supporters of unrestricted abortion in this country, Planned Parenthood and NARAL.</p>", "<p>Her vow to keep taxpayer dollars flowing to organizations that perform abortions\u2014a truly perverse example of cronyism\u2014surely helped seal the deal. She says that government should not be involved in abortion, but she means the opposite: government must force all of us to finance it.</p>", "<p>Government exists first and foremost to protect our rights and our lives. That\u2019s the conservative philosophy. It\u2019s also the philosophy of our Declaration of Independence, which declares that we have God-given rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.</p>", "<p>The order Jefferson chose was no accident. The right to life comes first because it is the most fundamental of our rights, the one without which we cannot enjoy the others.</p>", "<p>Thousands of people are marching in Washington, D.C., on Friday, January 22 because they understand that we must protect everyone, including the weakest and most vulnerable of all. They know that our country is better than abortion on demand.</p>", "<p>That is why they will succeed.

This flood of concerned citizens represents a deeply unsettled issue in our country: <i>the lives of children in their first nine months are not protected by law.</i></p>", "<p>Those who are marching are determined to change that, and to expand the protections of the law to these smallest and most vulnerable members of the human family.</p>", "<p>These citizens who are deeply committed to ending abortion do not restrict their pro-life activism to marching. Indeed, these are the same people who run pregnancy centers that provide alternatives to abortion each day, carry out healing ministries for those who have had abortions, undertake numerous educational efforts to help people understand the legal, moral, and sociological dimensions of abortion and the damage it does, preach sermons about how abortion violates the Word of God, and much more.</p>", "<p><i>And they work to elect pro-life candidates.</i></p>", "<p>Although the March for Life itself is not a political event, a keen awareness and a strong motivation of the marchers themselves this year is the fact that we have before us in 2016 the most important election we have ever faced.</p>", "<p>The March for Life is on January 22 precisely because the Supreme Court ruled on that day in 1973, through the twin decisions <i>Roe vs. Wade </i>and <i>Doe vs. Bolton, </i>that abortions can be performed throughout pregnancy. Marchers this year are keenly aware that the next President and Senate will have the opportunity to substantially shape the court in one direction or the other. And on the issue that these marchers care most about -- abortion -- the Republican and Democratic parties are diametrically opposed.</p>", "<p>At this point in the presidential race, the people who will be marching on Friday in Washington have not coalesced behind a single candidate. On the abortion issue, they have a lot of great options from which to choose. But there are a few points that do represent a consensus among this crowd:</p>", "<p>a) Legal abortion is not just bad policy; it redefines America and it redefines the relationship between government and human rights. Our right to life comes from God, not government. Therefore, not only <i>should </i>government not legalize abortion; it can't. To try to do so <i>is beyond its authority. </i>Roe vs. Wade is not just wrong; it's invalid.</p>", "<p>b) The right to life is not the only issue to consider in evaluating a candidate, but it is the <i>foundational</i> issue. Without life, we don't have anything. And if a politician can't respect the life of a little baby, how can he or she respect your life or mine? Just the fact that someone is prolife does not necessarily qualify him or her for public office; but justifying abortion does in fact disqualify a candidate.</p>", "<p>c) It is not enough for us to know what a candidate <i>believes </i>about abortion and the unborn child; we want to know what the candidate <i>is willing to do </i>to end abortion and protect the unborn child.</p>", "<p>d) While politics isn't the ultimate answer to solving the abortion problem, it's an essential part of the answer. Changing minds and hearts is not enough; public policy has to change so that the weak can be protected from those who hearts and minds have not changed.</p>", "<p>One of the roles that my organization has in the March for Life is that we organize the Youth Rally that takes place the day before, and during that youth rally, I will give a practical presentation about the elections of 2016. We will teach them how to foster voter registration, how to use voter guides, and how to get people to the polls, particularly by utilizing <i>early voting.</i> We will initiate an effort called <i>Drivers for Life, </i>recruiting volunteers to bring people to the polls who otherwise may not find it easy to get there.</p>", "<p>Likewise, at the interdenominational service in Constitution Hall on the morning of the March for Life, I will preach about the elections, and demonstrate the kind of fruit elections can bear by honoring Governor Sam Brownback of Kansas for being the first governor to sign into law a measure protecting unborn children from dismemberment abortion. </p>", "<p>I will also preach about the fact -- which I examine at length in my book <i>Abolishing Abortion -- </i>that the instructions pastors are sometimes given by their own church bodies to \"avoid <b><i>even appearing</i></b> to oppose or discredit a political party\" is not workable in the light of the Church's clear pro-life position and the Democratic party's clear support of abortion. </p>", "<p>I don\u2019t mean that the Church should be a partisan political machine; I mean that the Church should be <b><i>the Church, </i></b>clearly articulating her position, no matter what partisan accusations that may generate.</p>", "<p>And on this, you will find a consensus among the people who march this Friday. We will march for life, and our march on the streets will become a march into the voting booths to vote this November for public servants who know the difference between serving the public and killing the public.<br> </p>", "<p><i>Father Frank Pavone is National Director of <a href=\"http://www.priestsforlife.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Priests for Life</a> and Missionaries of the Gospel of Life.

Will they be conservative? What does that mean to you and how will you ensure it?\" he asked Donald Trump.</p>", "<p>When Trump replied that he would \"appoint conservative judges,\" Stephanopoulos asked for examples. Trump cited Justice Clarence Thomas and noted that Justice Roberts \"turned out to be an absolute disaster because he gave us ObamaCare.\" Trump added that he would \"work with people that I respect, conservative people\" in selecting judicial nominees.</p>", "<p>Because Donald Trump does not have any experience appointing judges, his best approach to the process would indeed be to rely heavily on the recommendations of respected conservatives in the legal community. Other GOP contenders have the legal background to take a more hands on approach.</p>", "<p>There is no one right answer, but questioning the presidential candidates about judicial appointments is vitally important. Stephanopoulos did well, going beyond asking Trump what kind of judges he would appoint by prodding him for specific examples. Most importantly, he asked the Republican candidate how he would <i>ensure</i> that his judicial nominees are truly judicial conservatives.</p>", "<p>The importance of that last question was emphasized last June with the most activist end of a Supreme Court term in recent memory, made possible by Republican Supreme Court appointees, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Anthony Kennedy.</p>", "<p>For the second time in three years, Chief Justice Roberts saved ObamaCare by rewriting the statute. At the same time, Justice Kennedy, a Reagan appointee, rubbed salt in what was already deep wounds of conservative disappointment by further involving the government in the marriage business and discovering a cause of action for \"disparate impact\" discrimination in the 1968 Fair Housing Act.</p>", "<p>Regardless of your views on ObamaCare, marriage, and disparate impact theories of discrimination, those three decisions in June 2015 should be disturbing because they remind us that there are virtually no limits on the Supreme Court's power to act as \"the Ruler of 320 million Americans coast-to-coast,\" as Justice Scalia observed in the marriage case.</p>", "<p>Over the past 50 years, a Democratic president has never failed to fill a Supreme Court vacancy with an appointee who was and remained a reliable liberal vote on the hot-button issues before the Court.</p>", "<p>Roberts and Kennedy \u2013 along with retired Justices Stevens, Souter, and O'Connor \u2013 make it painfully clear that Republican presidents do not have the same record with respect to conservative appointees.</p>", "<p>With several Supreme Court vacancies looming and hundreds of lower court appointments facing the next president, it is of utmost importance that the GOP presidential candidates articulate what procedures they would follow to ensure that the failures of past presidents are not repeated.</p>", "<p>What is the best way to identify a nominee who will remain committed to conservative judicial principles and the constitutional limits on government if placed on the federal bench? I believe the core characteristic GOP presidents should look for is the courage and commitment to follow the Constitution and laws where they lead, even when they lead to an inconvenient, uncomfortable or politically incorrect place.</p>", "<p>A <i>long </i>judicial record of constitutionalism \u2013 something Alito had but Roberts did not \u2013 is an important piece of evidence. But it is not the only predictor of judicial courage. That quality can be demonstrated on or off the bench.</p>", "<p>Again, there is no single right answer. What's important for now is that we hear from all the GOP hopefuls about how they would approach the challenge of filling judicial vacancies. What specific steps will they take in selecting nominees? What characteristics will they look for? What questions will they ask potential nominees?\u00a0</p>", "<p>Curt Levey is a constitutional law attorney and executive director of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://foundation.freedomworks.org/frontpage\">FreedomWorks Foundation</a>.

Trump also refused to address our arguments. Instead, he mislabeled the magazine a \u201cdying newspaper\u201d and said it had lost circulation and no one reads it. Many are reading this issue.</p>", "<p>One friend said he is convinced that Trump is \u201cteachable and we can move him in the right direction.\u201d On June 14, Trump will be 70 years old. By then, most people have long been settled in their worldview. Trump likes to cite Ronald Reagan, who was a Roosevelt Democrat before he famously said he didn\u2019t leave the Democratic Party, the party left him. But Reagan spent many years honing his conservative principles in speeches, articles, and radio commentaries. He did not have, as some nominees to high office experience, a \u201cconfirmation conversion.\u201d</p>", "<p>Quoting myself would be redundant (read us all at <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/article/430126/donald-trump-conservatives-oppose-nomination\" target=\"_blank\">National Review.com</a>), so here is the key paragraph from the lead editorial:</p>", "<p>\u201cTrump\u2019s politics are those of an averagely well-informed businessman: Washington is full of problems; I am a problem-solver; let me at them.\u00a0But if you have no familiarity with the relevant details and the levers of power, and no clear principles to guide you, you will, like most tenderfeet, get rolled. Trump has shown no interest in limiting government, in reforming entitlements, or in the Constitution. He floats the idea of massive new taxes on imported goods and threatens to retaliate against companies that do too much manufacturing overseas for his taste. His obsession is with \u2018winning,\u2019 regardless of the means \u2014 a spirit that is anathema to the ordered liberty that conservatives hold dear and that depends for its preservation on limits on government power.\u201d</p>", "<p>In the February 1 issue of <a href=\"http://www.weeklystandard.com/the-nominee-we-deserve/article/2000692\" target=\"_blank\">The Weekly Standard</a>, Stephen F. Hayes writes: \u201cThe Republican frontrunner is a longtime liberal whose worldview might best be described as an amalgam of pop-culture progressivism and vulgar nationalism. His campaign rallies are orgies of self-absorption, dominated by juvenile insults of those who criticize him and endless boasting about his poll numbers. He\u2019s a narcissist and a huckster, an opportunist who not only failed to join conservatives in the big fights about the size and scope of government over the past several decades but, to the extent he was even aware of such battles, was often funding the other side, with a long list of contributions to the liberals most responsible for the dire state of affairs in the country, including likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.\u201d</p>", "<p>What is the counter argument to these substantive opinions? Anger against the \u201cWashington establishment\u201d is not one. Those who worship Trump have an obligation to say why he is worthy of their faith. Given his liberal background and poor explanations of why he now believes differently, how do his supporters know he will govern conservatively should he win the White House? He once said his sister, who is pro-abortion, would be an excellent nominee to the Supreme Court. His story of how he supposedly became a pro-life convert lacks credibility.</p>", "<p>Electing a president, especially in a dangerous world, is important work. Anger and emotion should not govern the choice. Considered judgment should. Trump appeals to the former, but not the latter.</p>", "<p><i>Cal Thomas is America's most widely syndicated op-ed columnist.

Thus the 2014 dip does not necessarily establish a trend.</p>", "<p>Moreover, argues Paula Donovan, co-director of AIDS-Free World, the organization that made public in March the highly critical U.N. experts report on sexual abuse, one of the many loopholes in the U.N.\u2019s statistical catalogue is that one allegation does not always mean one person committing one offense.</p>", "<p>\u201cAn allegation is simply a report,\u201d she says. \u201cIt could include ten perpetrators or ten victims.\u201d U.N. data, she told a press conference last week, where she and a small array of present and former U.N. dignitaries announced the launch of a campaign dubbed Code Blue, is \u201cmisleading\u201d and \u201cconfusing.\u201d</p>", "<p>Code Blue aims to strip legal immunity automatically from any U.N. official accused of sexual abuse or exploitation, in a bid to both speed up the course of justice and prevent evidence from disappearing in the long time it takes investigations to occur. The U.N. opposes the idea, arguing that immunity is rapidly removed from offenders\u00a0once a case against them is made, and the Code Blue proposal would amount to a violation of due process.</p>", "<p>In addition, the Code Blue campaign aims to have the U.N. establish another independent panel of experts \u201cto examine every facet of sexual exploitation and abuse in peacekeeping\u201d -- more or less what Ban says he has already done.</p>", "<p><i>George Russell is editor-at-large of Fox News and can be found on Twitter:\u00a0</i><a href=\"https://twitter.com/GeorgeRussell\" target=\"_blank\"><i>@GeorgeRussell</i></a><i>\u00a0or on\u00a0</i><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/george.russell\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Facebook.com/George Russell</i></a></p>", "<p>\u00a0</p>"]}

In congressional hearings this month, Republicans said American commitments to cut emissions will make little difference and that the Obama Administration is giving control of American energy policy to the U.N.</p>", "<p>Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, chairman of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee, went further. He questioned the science that shows the Earth is warming and even subpoenaed records from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration that he said might show it had doctored data to get \"politically correct\" results.</p>", "<p><a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/science/2015/06/04/climate-change-brings-needed-rain-to-africa.html\">Skeptics</a> have largely dismissed the fears over global warming, saying climate change has been going on since the beginning of time.

What actually needs to be done is to ensure that $90 trillion goes into clean technology, resilient infrastructure and not into the kind of infrastructure, energy we had last century.\u201d</p>", "<p>The expected deal comes as more affordable renewables like wind and solar are motivating countries to cut their emissions, Figueres said, and the dangers of a warming planet blamed mostly on the burning of fossil fuels are becoming more visible.</p>", "<p>The Earth experienced record temperatures last year and is on pace to do the same in 2015, according to the NOAA.

But, rather, with full implementation of these climate change plans, we could be heading to a future that would increase the global temperature by 2.7 or 3 degrees.</p>", "<p>\u201cIs it enough? No. It clearly is not enough.

Negotiations faltered over who should take the lead in cutting emissions and how to help poor nations shift away from fossil fuels.</p>", "<p>This time, China and the U.S. have laid the groundwork. The U.S. says it will reduce emissions 26-28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. China has agreed to cap emissions by 2030, or earlier if possible, and increase the share of energy it derives from sources other than fossil fuels.</p>", "<p>India, another big emitter, has promised to reduce its emissions intensity by 33-35 percent below 2005 levels by 2030 and to increase electricity generated by sources other than fossil fuels by 40 percent.</p>", "<p>Critics say they are skeptical that China or India will take action or be able to wean themselves off their dependence on coal, and they doubt anyone will be able to verify their efforts even if they do.</p>", "<p>But Figueres said doubters should look at what both countries are doing on the renewable energy front.</p>", "<p>Related: <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/world/2015/11/09/china-shifts-course-on-carbon-emissions-promises-action-ahead-paris-climate/\">China shifts course on carbon emissions, promises action ahead of Paris climate talks</a></p>", "<p>\u201cChina is investing $80 billion into renewable energy, creating 3 million jobs (and) practically blanketing the Gobi Desert, because they want to take full advantage of their solar potential,\u201d Figueres said. \u201cTogether, China and India will be creating the opportunity and investing two times as much into solar and wind as the current global capacity in renewables\u2026.</p>", "<p>\u201cSo I actually do think that one has to look at the facts and the numbers and understand that the developing countries are moving forward in an accelerated and very determined pace to be able to clean their energy systems at a pace that we would have never thought possible even three or four years ago.\u201d</p>", "<p>\u00a0</p>", "<p>\u00a0</p>"]}

Kompass is still under internal U.N. investigation for the leak.</p>", "<p>Gallianne Palayret, a U.N. human rights\u00a0officer who compiled the original testimony from victims of the abuses allegedly carried out by a number of French and African soldiers in 2013 and 2014, made her new disclosure in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.francetvinfo.fr/replay-magazine/france-2/envoye-special/video-envoye-special-centrafrique-scandale-dans-l-armee-francaise_1108137.html\">a TV documentary on the aftermath of the abuses that aired in France on Oct. 2.</a></p>", "<p>The troops were members of a French-led force endorsed by a Dec. 5, 2013, U.N. Security Council resolution that among other things condemned \u201csexual violence against women and children,\u201d as well as rape, by sectarian forces ravaging\u00a0the country. A full-fledged U.N. peacekeeping force is now also in CAR.</p>", "<p>During the TV show, Palayret offered graphic descriptions of the alleged crimes, and brandished a red notebook that she said contained the personal accounts of six boys, ages 8 to 13, who had suffered the abuse.</p>", "<p>Palayret, who is now working for the U.N. in Phom Penh, Cambodia, told her interviewer that she met \u201cvery quickly\u201d with local French military authorities in May 2014 to warn them about the incidents and ask for increased patrols to prevent further abuse.</p>", "<p>She described a \u201cvery positive reaction\u201d to her revelations, along with promises that the military would \u201cimmediately\u201d notify authorities in Paris.</p>", "<p>According to the testimony of victims, however,\u00a0the abuses continued until at least June 2014.</p>", "<p>The documentary\u00a0also says that French Justice officials confirmed they only heard of the alleged crimes when Kompass, a senior official of the U.N.\u2019s Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights (OHCHR), to whom Palayret also reported, leaked a copy of her\u00a0 raw report, in mid-July 2014.

He and fellow OHCHR workers were apparently unaware of Palayret\u2019s\u00a0local meetings with military authorities.</p>", "<p>Indeed, in a letter to OHCHR officials in August 2014, after French investigators responded to Kompass\u2019 disclosure, Palayret\u00a0(her name was subsequently redacted) emphatically declared that she had never given her raw report to anyone outside the High Commissioner\u2019s office.</p>", "<p>The U.N. itself did not move against Kompass for another eight months, when he was suspended for passing on unredacted information, including the names of child witnesses, in violation of U.N. protocols that forbade handing on \u201cany information that could endanger victims, witnesses and investigators.\u201d Not long afterward, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/world/2015/05/01/african-troops-involved-with-french-in-un-rape-report-scandal/\">the scandal went public.</a> \u00a0</p>", "<p>U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon himself seemed to endorse the punitive action in an April 29, 2015,\u00a0statement that called the leak a \u201cserious violation of protocol.\u201d He noted Kompass\u2019 April 17 suspension and also declared that \u201cour preliminary assessment is that such conduct does not constitute whistle-blowing,\u201d a course of action that theoretically has protected status under U.N. directives.</p>", "<p>Within a week, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/world/2015/05/06/judge-slaps-down-un-on-sex-crimes-reporting/\">a\u00a0 U.N. dispute tribunal ordered Kompass\u2019 reinstatement,</a> on the grounds that the OHCHR official who gave the order didn\u2019t have the authority, and said that U.N. worries he might tamper with evidence while on the job were baseless.</p>", "<p>By the beginning of June, as worldwide outcry grew over the alleged crimes, Ban -- with U.S. urging -- suddenly scrambled\u00a0in a different direction. He announced creation of \u201can External Independent Review to examine the U.N. system\u2019s handling of these allegations,\u201d\u00a0starting in July. An internal investigation of Kompass\u2019 actions, however, kept going.</p>", "<p><br> <br> In August, Ban also fired his special envoy to CAR, who was also head of the MINUSCA peacekeeping force, after <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/world/2015/08/11/exclusive-another-un-child-sex-crime-allegation-who-knew-what-and-when/\">additional sexual-abuse cases cropped up</a> involving the U.N. peacekeeping forces.\u00a0</p>", "<p>For her part, Palayret had been staying very quiet, at least to outsiders.</p>", "<p>According to\u00a0Pierre Monegier, the French journalist who finally interviewed her for the TV documentary,\u00a0Palayret refused for 4 \u00bd months to speak with him, and he had \u201cgiven up all hope of getting in touch with her.\u201d</p>", "<p>Then, he told Fox News, \u201csomething changed in the situation.\u201d</p>", "<p>What that \u201csomething\u201d was, is still not clear. In the documentary, Palayret is said to be a \u201cwhistle-blower\u201d (in French, <i>lanceuse-d\u2019alerte</i>), a term that journalist Monegier told Fox News she used herself.</p>", "<p>\u201cI\u2019m baffled by the claim,\u201d said Bea Edwards, international program director of the Washington-based Government Accountability Project (GAP), a whistle-blower advocacy organization.</p>", "<p>Under directives from the U.N. Secretary General, that status is conferred by the U.N. Ethics Office on U.N. employees determined to have suffered from threatened or actual retaliation.</p>", "<p>Very few of such designations have been issued recently -- and while there may still be grounds for Kompass to charge he was the victim of retaliatory action despite Ban\u2019s earlier statements,\u00a0Palayret has not, to the best of anyone\u2019s knowledge, suffered any.</p>", "<p>The difference in treatment between the two U.N. staffers was underlined in a letter sent today to Ban Ki-moon by Miranda Brown, another former staffer at OHCHR who worked directly under Kompass, and subsequently <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://whistleblower.org/sites/default/files/Letter%20to%20Secretary%20General%20regarding%20OIOS%20investigation%20into%20Kompass%20disclosure%2013%20October%202015.pdf\">posted on GAP\u2019s website.</a> \u00a0</p>", "<p>Complaining about Kompass\u2019 treatment, Brown declared that \u201cno U.N. staff member should have been placed under investigation for trying to stop child sexual abuse,\u201d and said that the convoluted saga, including Palayret\u2019s belated TV appearance, \u201conly reinforce the notion that there are inadequate guidelines and protocols in place for dealing with such a situation and little protection for those who report wrongdoing.\u201d</p>", "<p>Since her brief star turn on French airwaves, Palayret has apparently returned to her run-silent-run-deep status. Repeated telephone calls by Fox News to a Cambodian telephone number for Palayret that was supplied by U.N. insiders were not answered.</p>", "<p>Fox News also sent questions to Ban Ki-moon\u2019s spokesman\u00a0about Palayret\u2019s appearance in the documentary, the claim of whistle-blower status, her claim to have passed evidence to the French military in CAR, whether Ban\u2019s office was aware in advance of Palayret\u2019s appearance in the documentary, and whether she had received permission to appear.</p>", "<p>The initial response from the spokesman was that he \u201chad not heard of the documentary nor of the whistle-blower status.\u201d A promise to \u201crevert\u201d was followed by days of silence.</p>", "<p>Finally, a deputy spokesman told Fox News that \u201cI don\u2019t have anything to say on this for now.\u201d</p>", "<p>Another U.N. spokesman told Fox News that neither the U.N.\u2019s Department of Peacekeeping Operations nor the current peacekeeping force in CAR, known as MINUSCA, were \u201caware of any whistle-blower status being given to Palayret by the Ethics Office.\u201d</p>", "<p>Nor were either of those two organizations aware of her provision of information to French authorities, and neither had advance notice of her TV appearance, the spokesman indicated.</p>", "<p>One of Palayret\u2019s other intriguing assertions to the French TV team was that her diplomatic immunity as a U.N. employee was lifted in July, which would allow her in theory to be interviewed by French investigators -- who, according to the documentary, had not yet done so.</p>", "<p>Nonetheless, the timing of the immunity release could well be significant. It coincides with the start of work by Ban\u2019s three-member \u201cexternal, independent\u201d review panel, which was initially supposed to report its findings within ten weeks, or around the beginning of September.</p>", "<p>As the panel is a non-U.N. body, Palayret would have to be granted leave -- and suspension of immunity -- in order to testify before it.</p>", "<p>The panel\u2019s report, however, was postponed until next month.</p>", "<p>Among other things, the ten-week deadline originally set by Ban meant that it would publish its controversial findings not long before September 28, when President Barack Obama was personally convening\u00a0a major summit meeting at the U.N.\u00a0to upgrade developed country support for U.N. peacekeeping.</p>", "<p>The U.N. has said there was no connection between the postponement and the date of President Obama\u2019s big peacekeeping event. But there is no doubt that a widespread debate beforehand about the U.N. handling of sex crimes would not have added luster to that occasion.</p>", "<p>The report is now due in early November.</p>", "<p>Meanwhile, the U.N. today posted the most recent annual report of its \u201cSpecial Rapporteur on the promotion and the protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression\u201d -- University of California Irvine Law Prof. David Kaye -- which included a special section on the responsibilities of international organizations toward whistle-blowers.</p>", "<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/world/interactive/2015/10/13/human-rights-whistle-blower-report/\">CLICK HERE FOR KAYE\u2019S REPORT</a></p>", "<p>\u00a0\u201cDisclosure of human rights or humanitarian law violations,\u201d Kaye concluded, \u201cshould never be the basis of penalties of any kind.\u201d</p>", "<p><i>George Russell is editor-at-large of Fox News and can be found on Twitter: \u00a0@GeorgeRussell or on Facebook.com/GeorgeRussell</i></p>", "<p>\u00a0</p>", "<p>\u00a0</p>"]}

Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has suddenly scrambled to announce an \u201cexternal, independent review\u201d panel to examine that issue, along with \u201ca broad range of systemic issues related to how the U.N. responds to serious information of this kind.\u201d</p>", "<p>Ban, who declared himself \u201cdeeply disturbed\u201d by the situation, said on Wednesday his intent was \u201cto ensure that the United Nations does not fail the victims of sexual abuse, especially when committed by those who are meant to protect them.\u201d</p>", "<p>In fact, Fox News has learned, Ban\u2019s action was also urged on him two days earlier by U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Samantha Power, as U.N. member states dickered in committee over a resolution that criticized Ban for the \u201cperceived lack of timely information\u201d he had provided on the abuse issue and the \u201clack of protection of whistleblower\u201d associated with the CAR incidents.</p>", "<p>At the time of Ban\u2019s announcement, U.S. and European diplomats were still offering up alternative wordings in committee to temper the harsher language.</p>", "<p>Ban\u2019s spokesman, Stephane Dujarric, told Fox News that \u201cthe need to set up such a review has been in discussion for a long time,\u201d but the specific terms of reference of the inquiry and its membership were not revealed in Ban\u2019s announcement, though he did specify it would look into \u201cthe treatment of the specific report of abuse in the Central African Republic.\u201d \u00a0</p>", "<p>According to Dujarric, both the terms of reference and the membership of the probe will be revealed \u201cas soon as possible\u201d \u2013a fairly clear indication that Ban\u2019s sparse announcement was intended more as an initial fire-fighting gesture than a fully-planned response to the sex-abuse crisis. \u00a0</p>", "<p>Another way to look at it is that the U.N.\u2019s top bureaucrat was trying to keep the explosive sex abuse issue from spinning further out of control, amid a gout of document leaks, finger-pointing and U.N. investigations criticized as focused on hushing up leakers than on protecting additional young and starving children in the war-torn CAR from rape, sodomy and other predatory offenses.</p>", "<p>Moreover, the CAR controversy is only the latest crest in a swelling critique of the U.N.\u2019s ability to protect the innocent from sex abuse where its blue-and-white flag is flying\u2014a critique that includes a long-suppressed report of U.N.-appointed experts <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/world/2015/03/27/un-peacekeeping-and-rape-getting-betteror-worse/\">who have decried a \u201cculture of impunity\u201d</a> in U.N. peacekeeping missions when it comes to such crimes.\u00a0</p>", "<p>The latest controversy has been further fueled by U.N. document leaks that raised the possibility of retaliatory collusion by the organization\u2019s independent Ethics Officer; the head of its main independent internal watchdog, the Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS); the U.N.\u2019s High Commissioner for Human Rights; and Ban\u2019s top deputy against Anders Kompass, a senior U.N. human rights official who first brought the Central African Republic scandal into the daylight.</p>", "<p>That interpretation was strenuously denied by one senior U.N. official, who requested anonymity, while for her part, the U.N. \u00a0Ethics Officer, Joan Dubinsky, declined comment saying \u201cI don\u2019t believe it is appropriate to comment on leaked documents.\u201d</p>", "<p>U.N. spokesman Dujarric told Fox News that an investigation of Kompass by OIOS for \u201cpossible staff misconduct,\u201d initiated in March, would nonetheless continue in parallel with the still-unformed inquiry panel. \u201cAny relevant information of a broad systemic nature that will come out of that investigation will be considered by the review,\u201d he declared.</p>", "<p>Kompass has already been asked to resign at the behest of the U.N.\u2019s High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra\u2019ad Al Hussein. He refused.</p>", "<p>Kompass was then briefly suspended from his work\u2014until a U.N. tribunal reversed the action-- in conjunction with his investigation by OIOS for passing on transcripts by U.N.-collected testimony from children who described their sexual abuse and exploitation by French and African peacekeepers in the chaos-shattered CAR in 2013 and 2014. The children were aged from 9 to 13.</p>", "<p>The troops were from a multinational contingent that preceded the current U.N. peacekeeping mission in CAR\u2014the U.N. forces took over in September 2015-- but were operating with U.N.

The district is being fully reimbursed by the state and federal government for compliance, and the kids are eating it up.</p>", "<p>\u201cYou have a variety of seven different feeding stations,\u201d Anthony N. Dragona, school administrator and secretary of the Union City Board of Education, said in an interview. \u201cCreate your own salad, create your own sandwich, whole wheat pasta bar. We incorporate parent, students, faculty, and we ask them, what do you want to see in your cafeteria?\u201d</p>", "<p>Dragona said that without a private company like Chartwells to lend a hand, food ends up being left on the plate. On their own, school districts are hard pressed to come up with innovative solutions in cafeteria design, menu creation, and school nutrition education. Dragona emphasized that Chartwells forges a partnership between parents and the school community.</p>", "<p>Margie Saidel, vice president of nutrition, culinary, and sustainability at Chartwells, brings close to 20 years of experience in child nutrition and food service to the lunch table. Speaking about the National School Lunch Program, she agreed with Dragona, \u201cThat\u2019s been difficult for a lot of school districts, and they\u2019ve seen their participation drop. But what we have decided is we are focusing on the taste and a full balanced meal.\u201d</p>", "<p>We still had our doubts when we arrived at Union City High School, but it soon became clear that Dragona and Saidel are right, Chartwells has taken the USDA guidelines and converted them into something with a lot of variety, a lot of health and a lot of choice. Just try a baked veggie roll and see for yourself.</p>", "<p>\u201cWe bring our team of experts, registered dietitians, culinarians and our food management expertise,\u201d Saidel said. \u201cAll the meals here are rich in color, all whole grain, many fruits and vegetables.\u201d</p>", "<p>Student liaison Josie Martinez said she preferred Chartwells\u2019 baked french fries to the fried kind. \u201cIt's not as greasy and it tastes a lot better,\u201d she said. \u201cIt doesn't slow you down later on, and it makes you feel more energetic.\u201d</p>", "<p>She said the kids were actually eating fruits and vegetables, even broccoli.</p>", "<p>\u201cBecause the food tastes so great, they participate,\u201d Seidel said. \u201cAnd the more they participate, the higher the revenue is for the school district. All schools in the National School Lunch Program have the ability to do that.\u201d</p>", "<p>The National School Lunch Program cost the government $70 million when it began in 1947. It\u2019s now in over 100,000 public and non-profit private schools and residential child care organizations, and it costs over $12 billion. As of 2012, more than 31 million children were getting their lunch through the program every day. Of those, 2.7 million had Chartwells as an intermediary.</p>", "<p>And Chartwells isn\u2019t alone. Another larger national food company, Aramark, is servicing public school lunch programs in urban areas around the country, and in New Jersey, a local vender called Masschio is doing the same thing.</p>", "<p>Chartwells adds flavor, variety and exciting presentation to the food, and it uses a smartphone app, \u201cNutrislice,\u201d that presents students and parents with the week\u2019s menu and nutrition information in advance. Focus groups and a voting system give the students control over what they see in the lunch line.</p>", "<p>\u201cYou\u2019re empowering the students,\u201d Dragona says. \u201cIt\u2019s not that the district is just giving them lunch. They\u2019re actually helping to shape it.\u201d</p>", "<p>Dragona said that Chartwells has been working with Union City School District for 18 years. When the new national school lunch guidelines were adopted five years ago and other school districts cringed and thought they might resist, Dragona said that Union City embraced them, since they already had many of the guidelines in place and much more. The school district had long focused on decreasing amounts of fats and sugars and increasing fruits and vegetables.</p>", "<p>According to Dragona, they switched to whole grains and stopped frying six years ago.</p>", "<p>Sure, Chartwells turns a profit, but they work under a \u201cbreak even\u201d contract with Union City, where no matter what the cost, it doesn\u2019t cost the school district anything. The federal government reimburses the school $2.30 for lunch, with a little more than half the students at full participation and the rest at 60 percent participation. More than enough to keep everyone happy and well fed.</p>", "<p>One walk through the elementary school is all you need to be convinced that a private solution can turn a floundering public program around. We asked a group of 7 and 8-year-olds if they were enjoying the food, and they shouted in unison, \u201cYes!\u201d</p>", "<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p>", "<p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s tasty!\u201d</p>", "<p>\u201cWhy else?\u201d</p>", "<p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s healthy!\u201d</p>", "<p><i>Allison Hedges is a field producer for \"Fox &amp; Friends\" on Fox News Channel.</i></p>", "<p>Dr. Marc Siegel, a practicing internist, joined FOX News Channel (FNC) as a contributor in 2008.</p>"]}

Reporters at the news conference were unusually deferential to Carter, which has not always been their attitude since he left office in 1981.</p>", "<p>What struck me was not only Carter\u2019s humility and gratitude for the opportunities and privileges he has enjoyed, but the inner peace he exuded. Evangelical Christians like Carter understand this from a Bible verse that says \u201cAnd the peace of God, which passes all understanding, shall guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.\u201d (Philippians 4:7)</p>", "<p>One can disagree with how Carter applied his faith, whether as a liberal on social issues like abortion and gay rights, or internationally where he frequently has cited Israel \u2014 not her enemies \u2014 as the main impediment to Middle East peace, but Carter probably has a better knowledge of the Bible\u2019s contents than any president since Abraham Lincoln.</p>", "<p>I attended Carter\u2019s Sunday school class at First Baptist Church in Washington, D.C., where he sometimes delivered the lesson. When at Camp David, he held services attended by family members, staff and invited guests. His example was cited by some in the Christian community as having a positive influence on people not well acquainted with the inside of a church building.</p>", "<p>Reporters who accompanied Carter to church rarely reported on what he said.

It\u2019s not something guaranteed to each of us.

When the State Department responded to the Judicial Watch FOIA request by telling Judicial Watch that it had no emails from Clinton, Judicial Watch filed a lawsuit. When the State Department made the same representation to the court -- as incredible as it seemed at the time -- the judge accepted that representation, and the case was dismissed.</p>", "<p>Then The New York Times revealed that Clinton used a private email server instead of the government\u2019s server for all of her work-related and personal emails during her four years as secretary of state. After that, the Judicial Watch FOIA case was reinstated, and then the judge in the case demanded of State that it produce Clinton\u2019s emails.</p>", "<p>When Judicial Watch expressed frustration to the judge about the pace at which it was getting emails, the judge ordered Clinton, \u201cunder penalty of perjury,\u201d to certify that she had surrendered all her governmental emails to the State Department.</p>", "<p>Eventually, Clinton did certify to the court that she did surrender all of her governmental emails to the State Department. She did so by sending paper copies of selected emails, because she had wiped clean her server. She acknowledged that she decided which emails were personal and which were selected as governmental and returned the governmental ones to the State Department. She has denied steadfastly and consistently that she ever sent or received any materials marked \"classified\u201d while secretary of state using her private server.</p>", "<p>All of her behavior has triggered the FBI investigation because she may have committed serious federal crimes. For example, it is a crime to steal federal property. What did she steal? By diverting to her own venue the digital metadata that accompany all emails -- metadata that, when attached to the work-related emails of a government employee, belong to the government -- she stole that data. The metadata do not appear on her paper copies -- hence the argument that she stole and destroyed the government-owned metadata.</p>", "<p>This is particularly troublesome for her present political ambitions because of a federal statute that disqualifies from public office all who have stolen federal property. (She is probably already barred from public office -- though this was not prominently raised when she entered the U.S. Senate or the Department of State -- because of the china, silverware and furniture that she and her husband took from the White House in January 2001.)</p>", "<p>Clinton may also have committed espionage by failing to secure the government secrets entrusted to her. She did that by diverting those secrets to an unprotected, nongovernmental venue -- her own server -- and again by emailing those secrets to other unprotected and nongovernmental venues. The reason she can deny sending or receiving anything marked \"classified\u201d is that protected government secrets are not marked \u201cclassified.\u201d</p>", "<p>So her statement, though technically true, is highly misleading. The governmental designations of protected secrets are \u201cconfidential,\u201d \u201csecret\u201d and \u201ctop secret\u201d -- not \u201cclassified.\u201d State Department investigators have found 999 emails sent or received by Clinton in at least one of those three categories of protected secrets.</p>", "<p>Back when Clinton became secretary of state, on her first day in office, she had an hourlong FBI briefing on the proper and lawfully required care of government secrets. She signed a statement, under penalty of perjury, acknowledging that she knew the law and that it is the content of emails, not any stamped markings, that makes them secret.</p>", "<p>Earlier this week, my Fox News colleagues confirmed the certain presence of top-secret materials among the 999 emails. Intelligence from foreign sources or about foreign governments is always top-secret, whether designated as such or not. And she knows that.</p>", "<p>As well, she may have committed perjury in the FOIA case. When the House Select Committee on Benghazi, in its investigation of her role in the deaths of the U.S. ambassador to Libya and three other Americans, gathered emails, it found emails she did not surrender to the State Department.</p>", "<p>Last week, the State Department released emails that give the FBI more areas to investigate. These emails may show a pattern of official behavior by Clinton designed to benefit the financial interests of her family's foundation, her husband and her son-in-law. Moreover, the FBI knows of a treasure-trove of documents that may demonstrate that the Clinton Foundation skirted the law and illegally raised and spent contributions.</p>", "<p>Two months ago, a group of FBI agents sat around a conference table and reviewed the evidence gathered thus far. Each agent was given the opportunity to make or detract from the case for moving forward. At the end of the meeting, it was the consensus of the group to pursue a criminal investigation.</p>", "<p>And Clinton is the likely target.</p>", "<p>Andrew P.

Executive orders do not direct private persons, or persons in the legislative or judicial branches of government. Executive orders remain in effect until abandoned or rescinded by the president who issued them or by a successor president.</p>", "<p>President Obama has very little room to issue executive orders on guns because the congressional legislation is so extensive, detailed, and clear. The principal thrust of the president\u2019s orders addresses the requirement for background checks in occasional sales and the requirement that occasional sellers become federal licensees and the imposition of reporting upon physicians.</p>", "<p>Congress has expressly removed occasional sales (sales not made by full-time dealers) from the obligation of obtaining federal licenses and from conducting background checks.</p>", "<p>The president is without authority to negate the congressional will on this, and any attempt to do so will be invalidated by the courts. Mr. Obama will now require that anyone who sells a gun, that is even an \u201coccasional\u201d seller will be required to perform a background check. By defining what an \u201coccasional seller\u201d is, the president is essentially interpreting the law, a job reserved for the courts.</p>", "<p>The courts will ignore his interpretation, and impose their own.</p>", "<p>As well, by requiring physicians to report conversations with their patients about guns to the Department of Homeland Security, (yes, even an innocent conversation in the examination room, \u201cwe gave Bobby a bee bee gun for Christmas, we plan to get him some instruction on how to use it\u201d) the president will be encouraging our government to invade the patient/physician privilege.</p>", "<p>But wait, there\u2019s more. The Supreme Court has made it clear that the right to keep and bear arms is a fundamental liberty. Under the Constitution, fundamental liberities (like speech, press, worship, self-defense, travel, privacy) are accorded the highest protection from governmental intrusion.</p>", "<p>One can only lose a fundamental right by intentionally giving it up, or via due process (a jury trial resulting in the conviction of criminal behavior). President Obama --\u00a0 whose support for the right to keep and bear arms is constitutionally limited to the military, police, and his own heavily-armed body guards --\u00a0 is happy to begin taking America to a slippery slope down the dark hole of totalitarianism whereby a president can negate liberty.</p>", "<p>Finally, we still have a Constitution in America. Under the Constitution, Congress writes the laws, the president enforces them, and the courts interpret them.</p>", "<p>President Obama can no more write his own laws or impose his own interpretations upon them than the Congress or the courts can command the military.</p>", "<p>Andrew P.

We\u2019re seeing their voting power in action in both Kansas and South Dakota\u2019s senate races where independents Greg Orman and Larry Pressler are not only in contention, but leading in some polls.</p>", "<p>But in Illinois, where politics is notoriously rough and four of the last seven governors have wound up in prison, any candidate who wasn\u2019t a Democrat or a Republican has been forced off the ballot, except for Grimm.</p>", "<p>So what makes Grimm so special?</p>", "<p>I\u2019m not convinced that he really is. His role in the election is more about sending a message to Illinois\u2019s established politicians. And that leaves them with little choice but to vote for Grimm. Either that, or they bite the bullet and vote for the deeply unpopular Quinn, or Rauner, who\u2019s earned a reputation as a behind the scenes Republican donor.</p>", "<p>For frustrated Americans, biting the bullet is less appetizing than ever before.</p>", "<p>As the races in Kansas and South Dakota show, people are becoming less willing to vote for a candidate they perceive as the lesser of two evils and more willing to see a vote for an independent or third party candidate as a positive political statement, rather than a wasted vote.\u00a0</p>", "<p>Put another way, voters across America are looking for ways to register their unhappiness with the state of our politics and the quality of our politicians. Voting for a candidate like Grimm is one way to do that.</p>", "<p>When people hear a candidate say, as Grimm has said about Quinn and Rauner, that, \u201cOnce [politicians] get elected, the doors close, they smoke the same cigars, and pass the same kind of legislation,\u201d voters recognize the sense of mistrust and dissatisfaction that is spreading throughout the American electorate, and they respond to it.</p>", "<p>While Grimm won\u2019t be taking over the governorship, he may very well win enough votes on Election Day to deny either Rauner or Quinn the office.</p>", "<p>The message to Republicans and Democrats is clear. They need to take a good, hard look at why so many Americans just don\u2019t want to vote for their candidates any more. And they need to change it.</p>"]}

It\u2019s hard to know whether Tuesday\u2019s results will make much difference. Often, individual liberty erodes in ways that neither major political party much cares about.</p>", "<p>Last weekend, I suffered through the New York Marathon. I suffered not because I ran 26.2 miles but because I live near Central Park, and at Marathon time, officials turn my neighborhood into a little police state. Four thousand police officers, 20 boats and four blimps \u201cguarded\u201d the Marathon. Barricades, bomb-sniffing dogs and surveillance cameras were everywhere.</p>", "<p>This is new. Marathons used to be fun, people-friendly events. Athletes and spectators mingled freely. No more. New York\u2019s authorities now treat marathon spectators as annoyances, if not threats. Even runners must pass through magnetometers before they may race.</p>", "<p>[pullquote]</p>", "<p>This happened, of course, because of the horrible bombing in Boston. That shut down parts of Boston for nine days. But other countries\u2019 response to terrorism is less extreme. Fifty-two people were killed in the London Underground bombing of 2005. By 4 p.m. that same day, bus service resumed.</p>", "<p>In my neighborhood, concrete blocks and parked garbage trucks (manned by a union driver) prevent civilian vehicles from entering or leaving (in case terrorists drive a car over Central Park\u2019s wall and then through the trees to kill runners?). We were allowed to <i>walk </i>home, but only if we showed ID's that proved we lived on that street. The ground was covered in litter, since authorities remove every trash can, lest a terrorist hide a bomb in one.</p>", "<p>I can\u2019t imagine what all this costs.</p>", "<p>Police barricades are everywhere these days. If you want to watch the Fourth of July fireworks in New York City, you may no longer just gather with friends and have a picnic. Police herd spectators into barricaded pens, and if people try to climb out to use a bathroom, cops yell: \u201cStop! Once you\u2019re in, you\u2019re in.\u201d</p>", "<p>I doubt that such \u201csecurity theater\u201d makes us safer. If terrorists want to make a statement, they will find other locations.</p>", "<p>Government always grows. Police departments are no exception. The incentive is always: do \u00a0<i>more</i>. Politicians reason, \u201cIf anything goes wrong, I\u2019ll be blamed. Someone else pays for prevention, though, so I\u2019ll take every precaution.\u201d</p>", "<p>I once asked New York City\u2019s police commissioner if there was now \u201ctoo much security.\u201d He replied, \u201cpeople want to <i>feel</i> safe.\u201d</p>", "<p>Yes, most people will give up liberty for security.</p>", "<p>But when we change society this way, we let the terrorists win.</p>", "<p>That\u2019s one reason I fight with Ann Coulter. She wrote, \u00a0\u201cIf you are considering voting for the Libertarian candidate in any Senate election, please send me your name and address so I can track you down and drown you \u2026 [because] nothing matters more to the country than Republicans taking a majority in the Senate.\u201d</p>", "<p>That mindset distracts us from defending something far more important than either party: individual liberty. Neither Republicans nor Democrats consistently protect it.</p>", "<p>When I told Coulter that I often vote Libertarian, she replied: \u201cInfluence the Republican Party. \u2026 Do not be the spoiler to hand the government over to Democrats, who I promise do not share a single principle with you.\u201d</p>", "<p>Democrats do want government control of the economy and more regulation of speech, innovation, medicine, school and all kinds of things that ought to be fun. But I feel threatened by Republicans, too. Some want to control our personal lives and fight constant wars abroad.</p>", "<p>I don\u2019t want government to regulate every inch of my life. That\u2019s why I\u2019m a libertarian.</p>", "<p>Most Republicans and Democrats don\u2019t love liberty enough to remove those barricades near Central Park, or countless other impediments to doing what we want. They impose a million boring, bureaucratic intrusions on daily life.<br> It\u2019s time America obsessed less about Republicans vs. Democrats and more about liberty, in all its forms.<br> Still, I\u2019m delighted that Republicans won the Senate yesterday, finally taking power from the destructive Harry Reid.

Much to the shock of many, instead of thanking the West, the Ayatollah had his followers invade embassies and take 66 American diplomatic personnel hostage.<br> <br> The Ayatollah is long gone but his legacy of hatred of America and Israel; of terrorism by proxy; of diplomatic duplicity lives on.<br> <br> Today, Tehran is doing its best to disabuse anyone who thought that the P5+1 international nuke deal will produce any change in the regime\u2019s behavior.<br> <br> No sooner had the disappearing ink dried on the deal, when alarming news came that Tehran had already violated the agreement by testing two long-range missiles. This was a dual success for Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards. Technically, Iran now has the capacity to deliver miniature atomic warheads that could target Israel, Saudi Arabia and Europe. Equally important is that Tehran has tested the international community\u2019s resolve and the world blinked again, and sanctions will be lifted next month.<br> <br> Now the Iranians may have upped the ante again. The cornerstone of the P5+1 accord is that Iran will dismantle centrifuges before the lifting of sanctions. But in a December 18th interview in <i>The New Yorker</i>, Iran\u2019s Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, who personally negotiated the deal, hinted that the sanctions must go first:<br> <br> \"Where does the Iran nuclear deal stand? What is your timetable to complete steps pledged in dismantling part of the program?<br> Zarif: We're not dismantling anything. We are uninstalling some centrifuges and reconstructing the Arak reactor, modernizing it...The remaining activities that we need undertake will not take more than several days, less than two weeks.<br> \"Is there a projected day for implementation?<br> Zarif: Well, we need to resolve still some political issues...There are obligations on the other side that we have to make sure are implemented before we start the final stage of our implementation\u2026<br> <br> And what signal is the U.S. sending Tehran?</p>", "<p><br> <i>The Wall Street Journal </i>reports that Secretary of State John Kerry wrote to his Iranian counterpart on Saturday to assure him the visa changes approved by Congress last week won\u2019t undermine business opportunities in Iran. Citing the State Department\u2019s ability to expedite visa applications, Kerry also said the White House had the power to issue waivers to exempt individuals from the new travel laws!<br> <br> \u201cI am also confident that the recent changes in visa requirements passed in Congress\u2026will not in any way prevent us from meeting our\u201d commitments under the nuclear deal, Kerry wrote. \u201cWe will implement them so as not to interfere with legitimate business interests in Iran.\u201d<br> <br> Tehran has sent out another broadside, this one aimed at denigrating the 6 million Jewish victims of the Nazi Holocaust. It has announced the Third International Holocaust Cartoon Contest. First launched in 2006 in response to a Mohammed cartoon controversy, previous \u201cwinners\u201d included a cartoon showing grinning soldiers above a freshly dug mass grave in which they are placing not real corpses, but merely paper cut-outs suggesting that there were no real Holocaust victims. </p>", "<p>The grand prize winner, a Moroccan entry, showed an Israeli crane building a wall around Jerusalem\u2019s Dome of the Rock on which there was the image of the infamous Auschwitz death camp. Tehran also broke new media ground by introducing for children animated versions of the hate on Holocartoon.com.\u00a0</p>", "<p>In 2007, Iran even filed a complaint with the United Nations Human Rights Council against those who do not deny the Holocaust. Iran was also the only country to attack U.N. Resolution 61/255 against Holocaust denial, which the United Nations General Assembly passed in 2007.<br> <br> The regime\u2019s latest move is not only designed to alarm and enrage Israel and the Jewish people, but to also expose the hypocrisy of European nations including Germany. These nations lead International Holocaust Day commemorations each year, but utter nary a peep of protest against a Mullahocracy that serially denies the Shoah, lest they be barred from pursuing lucrative economic deals with Iran.<br> <br> With no price to pay for its past bad behavior, Tehran should have a very good 2016. True, the price of oil has plummeted, but a $150 billion windfall guaranteed by President Obama should provide the economic cushion for the regime at home, with a few billion left to continue to spread their hate and terror abroad.<br> </p>", "<p><i>Rabbi Abraham Cooper is associate Dean of the </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.wiesenthal.com/site/pp.asp?c=lsKWLbPJLnF&amp;b=6212365\"><i>Simon Wiesenthal Center</i></a><i> in Los Angeles.

John Cornyn: In 2015, new Senate majority delivered for the nation"], "article_url": ["http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/12/28/sen-john-cornyn-in-2015-new-senate-majority-delivered-for-nation.html"], "article_author": ["FoxNews.com"], "article_timestamp": ["2015-12-28T11:59:00.000-05:00"], "article_content": ["<p>Congress is often characterized as a place of partisan bickering and gridlock\u2014where debate and partisan rancor is widespread, but little is actually accomplished. Too often, this assessment has proven accurate. But last fall, the American people decided to change that, sending a Republican majority to the U.S. Senate. Since January, and under Republican leadership, the Senate has delivered on our promise to pass legislation to help American families, grow our economy, and keep us safe.</p>", "<p>At the beginning of the 114<sup>th</sup> Congress, I introduced the <i>Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act</i>\u2014legislation aimed at defeating the scourge of human trafficking in this country. Human trafficking is a horrendous practice that, tragically, can be found in every state. Fortunately, members in both parties, and in both Chambers, understood the great need to urgently fight this reprehensible practice. </p>", "<p>Legislators from across the political spectrum united under a common cause: to help victims of modern-day slavery recover and rebuild their lives. In the spring, the <i>Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act</i> passed with 99 votes in the Senate, and paved the way for these brave survivors\u2014some young children\u2014to find a path to healing. It\u2019s now the law of the land.</p>", "<p>Congress also tackled major issues concerning our national security. This fall, both Chambers overwhelmingly passed the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). The NDAA is integral to ensuring that our military is resourced, trained and ready for action when called upon. </p>", "<p>And in the wake of several serious security breaches of federal government computer servers over the summer\u2014and the brazen theft of the personal information of millions of Americans\u2014the clear need for robust cyber security legislation became even more apparent. So, the Senate passed the <i>Cyber Information Sharing Act</i> to give the public and private sectors the tools to act more nimbly when attacks are detected.</p>", "<p>We\u2019ve also passed legislation to grow our economy not just for today, but for years down the road. In June, Congress passed Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) legislation. TPA is a blueprint for pending and future trade negotiations\u2014one that ensures that American farmers, ranchers, and manufacturers get the best deal possible. By setting the ground rules on agreements with countries in Asia, Latin America, and Europe, TPA opens doors of opportunity to our country\u2019s businesses around the world, and is essential to growing our economy.</p>", "<p>But perhaps the most significant achievement was confronting entrenched policy problems that proved too divisive or complicated to tackle in the past.</p>", "<p>In April, Congress came together to bring about much-needed reform to the payment system for doctors who treat Medicare patients. The legislation preserved seniors\u2019 access to care, and ended years of uncertainty for physicians. </p>", "<p>Congress also passed the first significant education reform since 2001. The<i> Every Student Succeeds Act</i> ensures that parents, teachers, and local school boards will hold the reins to their children\u2019s education, not the federal government.</p>", "<p>And for the first time in more than a decade, Congress passed a multi-year transportation bill\u2014the result of hard work across party lines over the course of this year. Passage of this bill marked an end to years of short-term extensions, and will allow states the freedom and flexibility to plan for and deliver major transportation and infrastructure projects across the country. This will help make our nation\u2019s transportation system safer and more efficient, and lays the groundwork for even greater economic growth.</p>", "<p>Last fall, Republicans set the bar high for the new Senate majority. We pledged to get back to work, and to create and pass substantive pieces of legislation. We did that, and proved that inaction didn\u2019t have to be the norm. Effective governance and principled leadership doesn\u2019t shy away from confronting long-standing, seemingly intractable policy problems head-on.</p>", "<p>As we look to the year ahead, our work is far from over. But by keeping the American people in the drivers\u2019 seat, we will continue to deliver real solutions for our country.</p>", "<p><i>Republican John Cornyn represents Texas in the United States Senate where he serves on the Judiciary Committee.

They should have forwarded that subsequent story.

Cruz, a Texas senator, had 28 percent, and Trump had 24 percent. How much the drop-out rumors may have affected that count is unclear. But the interactive caucus process does offer an opportunity for supporters of one candidate to be persuaded to change sides before casting their ballot.</p>", "<p>The usually mild-mannered Carson accused the other side of using the process to execute \u201cdirty tricks.\u201d</p>", "<p>\u201cIt\u2019s the exact thing the American people are tired of,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy would we want to continue with this kind of shenanigans?\u201d</p>", "<p>He said his suspicions were also confirmed by tweets, \u201cother correspondence,\u201d and a first-hand experience by his wife at a precinct.</p>", "<p>Carson said his wife Candy arrived at the precinct to learn that a Cruz supporter was \u201cdisseminating\u201d the misinformation and was asked to set straight the record.</p>", "<p>\u201cShe did, and we won that precinct,\u201d he said.</p>", "<p>One of the tweets, Carson noted, came from Rep. Steve King, a Cruz supporter and an influential Iowa Republican.</p>", "<p>King later tweeted that he respects Carson and regrets any \"miscommunications.\"</p>", "<p>Carson said if Cruz was unaware of the tactics, then he should find out who was involved and fire them. And if Cruz knew about the effort, he should admit his involvement and \u201coffer a solution,\u201d Carson said.</p>", "<p>The Cruz campaign is also taking heat for a \u201cmailer\u201d it sent out to potential voters before caucus night that seemingly accused them of voting violations.</p>", "<p>Tyler earlier told MSNBC that Iowans are used to getting similar ones and that the campaign \u201cmodeled ours after them.\u201d</p>"]}

Like in 2008, she could very well go 1-1 with her closest rival in the first two contests.</p>", "<p>Further, the race essentially begins at a near-draw in the delegate count. Sanders noted that Iowa's 44 Democratic national convention delegates would be distributed almost evenly between the two candidates. The Associated Press reported that Clinton had captured at least 22 delegates to Sanders' 21, with the remaining one going to the statewide winner.\u00a0</p>", "<p>Republicans gleefully described the returns as a problem for Clinton.</p>", "<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a total disaster for Hillary Clinton,\u201d Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus told Fox News, predicting the Democrats could be \u201ceven more unclear in April than we are\u201d in their nominating contests.</p>", "<p>Nevertheless, the Clinton campaign touted their narrow delegate lead early Tuesday as a victory, plain and simple \u2013 though it appeared some precincts had stray delegates decided by coin toss.\u00a0</p>", "<p>\"Statistically, there is no outstanding information that could change the results and no way that Senator Sanders can overcome Secretary Clinton's advantage,\u201d the campaign said.</p>", "<p>A number of news outlets, including Fox News, have not yet formally called the contest for the former secretary of state.\u00a0</p>", "<p>Sanders said the results sent a \u201cprofound message\u201d to the media and political establishment.</p>", "<p>Anti-establishment overtones also were apparent on the Republican side, where Cruz claimed a more resounding victory in the state.</p>", "<p>\u201cTonight is a victory for the grassroots. Tonight is a victory for courageous conservatives across Iowa and all across this great nation,\u201d Cruz told cheering supporters.</p>", "<p>In the Republican campaign, Cruz fought hard in recent weeks to make up lost ground in the polls and was helped in part by a sophisticated ground operation. He also hammered Trump for his decision to skip last week's Republican debate.\u00a0</p>", "<p>Meanwhile, Rubio's stronger-than-expected third place finish was helped in large part by late deciders.

But they warned that inherent physical differences and different injury rates between men and women will have an impact on how the integration moves ahead.</p>", "<p>The selective service question revealed differences between the military chiefs and their political leaders. Army Gen. Mark Milley and Marine Gen. Robert Neller both flatly said that women should be included in the requirement to register for the selective service at age 18. But Navy Secretary Ray Mabus and Army Acting Secretary Patrick Murphy would only say that the issue should be discussed. Political leaders overall have so far been reluctant to endorse the draft requirement.</p>", "<p>The sometimes contentious hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee laid bare the deep reluctance of Marine Corps leaders to bring women into certain demanding infantry, armor and special operations jobs.</p>", "<p>After a lengthy review by the services and the Pentagon, Defense Secretary Ash Carter in December ordered all combat jobs open to women, but also vowed that no standards would be lowered to make way for women.</p>", "<p>The Marine Corps initially sought to keep certain infantry and combat jobs closed to women, citing studies showing combined-gender units are not as effective as male-only units. Allowing women to compete for ground combat jobs, it concluded, would make the Marine Corps a less-efficient fighting machine.</p>", "<p>Both Mabus and Carter rejected that argument. In response, Marine leaders, including Neller, immediately began to lay out implementation plans, but they continue to make clear their reservations.</p>", "<p>\"We have a decision and we're in the process of moving out,\" Neller told the senators. \"We will see where the chips fall. And, again, our hope is that everyone will be successful. But hope is not a course of action on the battlefield.\"</p>", "<p>Neller said that Marine Corps testing revealed two significant differences between all-male units and those with men and women. He said all-male units were able to better march long distances carrying heavy loads and also were able to fire their weapons more accurately after marching over distance.</p>", "<p>Being big and strong and having a \"certain body mass give you an advantage,\" said Neller. He added that as women do more conditioning and weight training to meet combat standards, they have been more likely to be outside the required weight and size requirements for women. The Marine Corps, he said, is looking at that issue.</p>", "<p>Mabus and Neller have deep differences on how the Marine Corps should proceed, and provided their views in starkly different ways.</p>", "<p>Mabus presented a lengthy opening statement laying out his views and why he disagreed with the Marine's recommendation, and had to be warned by McCain to finish up quickly. Neller, meanwhile, made no opening statement, provided short, clipped answers to questions, and avoided most direct disagreements with Mabus.</p>", "<p>Asked to list his concerns, Neller said he's worried about retention, injury rates and unit effectiveness.</p>", "<p>Lawmakers, including McCain, criticized Mabus for deciding to allow women to compete for Marine combat jobs \u2014 and telling the media \u2014 before fully reading and taking into account the massive Marine study.</p>", "<p>\"You're handling of this issue has really complicated this issue for those of us who support integration,\" McCain snapped at Mabus at the end of the hearing.</p>", "<p>Milley said he fully supported allowing women to seek combat jobs, but cautioned that it should be done slowly and methodically because \"we must not rush to failure.\"</p>", "<p>The military leaders said that for the first time the services are developing standards that are specific to each job, based on the requirements and tasks that must be accomplished. Those standards, they said, will be applied equally for men and women.</p>", "<p>Milley added that at this point he does not expect that women will be forced into infantry jobs. The Army, he said, doesn't involuntarily send men to the combat post right now and the service is meeting all its needs. But, he said, things could change in the future depending on the military's needs.</p>", "<p>Carter's order to allow women to compete for combat posts opens the final 10 percent of military positions to women \u2014 a total of about 220,000 jobs. And it allows them to serve in the most demanding and difficult jobs, including as special operations forces, such as the Army Delta units and Navy SEALs.</p>"]}

But Cruz avoided taking on Trump in favor of Rubio \u2013 he even jokingly backed Trump\u2019s plan to build a border wall.</p>", "<p>\u201cWe will build a wall that works, and I\u2019ll get Donald Trump to pay for it,\u201d Cruz said.</p>", "<p>Later on, Trump backed off comments where he said Cruz acted in Congress like \u201ca bit of a maniac.\u201d Trump said Tuesday, \u201cHe\u2019s just fine, don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p>", "<p>Instead, Trump took heat mostly from former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who slammed Trump\u2019s plan to ban Muslims from entering the United States as \u201cnot a serious proposal.\u201d\u00a0</p>", "<p>\u201cHe\u2019s a chaos candidate, and he\u2019d be a chaos president,\u201d Bush said.</p>", "<p>Trump fired back that \u201cJeb doesn\u2019t really believe I\u2019m unhinged\u201d and only went after him because he\u2019s \u201cfailed in this campaign.\u201d</p>", "<p>The Trump-Bush acrimony simmered throughout the debate, with Bush later telling Trump he can\u2019t \u201cinsult your way to the presidency,\u201d and Trump once again reminding Bush that his poll numbers have plummeted while Trump is leading.</p>", "<p>Whether Bush\u2019s attacks will help the struggling candidate remains to be seen. Perhaps more consequential is whether Rubio or Cruz can present himself as more capable of taking on the country\u2019s security challenges.</p>", "<p>Bush followed up on his criticism of Trump on Fox &amp; Friends Wednesday morning, saying: \"I just don't think he's ready from day one to be President of the United States.\"</p>", "<p>\u201cHe has made it clear that he gets his foreign policy advice from the shows, he makes it clear hew thinks Hillary Clinton was a great negotiator with Iran, he thinks ISIS wasn\u2019t a threat just two months ago \u2013 he\u2019s not a serious candidate,\u201d Bush said.</p>", "<p>All the leading candidates, though, focused on the terror threat throughout the CNN-hosted primary debate Tuesday night in Las Vegas \u2013 an event held just hours after Los Angeles closed its school system over a terror threat.</p>", "<p>Citing that closure, which is now thought to have been prompted by a hoax threat, Christie said children will be going back to school filled with anxiety. And he said the country\u2019s overall security environment has been hurt by President Obama and Hillary Clinton\u2019s policies.</p>", "<p>\u201cAmerica has been betrayed,\u201d he said.</p>", "<p>Christie cited his experience as a federal prosecutor, and governor, in saying that under a Christie presidency, \u201cAmerica will be safe.\u201d</p>", "<p>Carson also dismissed \u201cPC\u201d concerns about some of his own plans for taking on the terror threat.</p>", "<p>\u201cWe are at war \u2026 We need to be on a war footing,\u201d Carson said, while later making an argument against toppling foreign dictators. He compared the situation to being on a plane, where passengers in an emergency are advised to use oxygen masks themselves before helping others.</p>", "<p>\u201cWe need oxygen right now,\u201d Carson said, adding the government needs to think of the needs of the American people before solving everyone else\u2019s problems.</p>", "<p>Trump also sparred at times with other lower-polling candidates.</p>", "<p>As before, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul questioned Trump\u2019s policy proposals, including to restrict the Internet to clamp down on ISIS\u2019 social media use. \u201cDo you believe in the Constitution?\u201d Paul said of Trump supporters. Trump clarified he\u2019s only talking about restricting the Internet in parts of Iraq and Syria.</p>", "<p>And when Trump suggested that the money spent toppling Mideast dictators could have been better spent on building America\u2019s roads and bridges, former HP CEO Carly Fiorina compared him to Obama.</p>", "<p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what President Obama has said. I\u2019m amazed to hear that from a Republican presidential candidate,\u201d she said.</p>", "<p>Ohio Gov. John Kasich also took issue with suggestions from Cruz and Trump that the priority in Syria is not to remove Bashar Assad.</p>", "<p>\u201cWe can\u2019t back off of this,\u201d Kasich said. \u201cHe must go.\u201d</p>", "<p>CNN also hosted a debate Tuesday for the second-tier GOP candidates -- former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham and former New York Gov. George Pataki. Graham was particularly critical of Trump\u2019s Muslim ban plan at that debate, accusing him of declaring war on Islam and delivering a \u201ccoup\u201d for ISIS.</p>"]}

But you're out traveling, you're trying to negotiate something. You want to communicate with people, it's the fastest way to do it.\"</p>", "<p>Clinton's use of a personal server for her official emails during her time as secretary of state is now being reviewed by the FBI.\u00a0</p>", "<p>The Democratic presidential candidate has maintained she never sent or received information that was marked classified at the time.

Bernie Sanders. Clinton's once double-digit lead in Iowa has dwindled to just 6 points, while Sanders has opened a 22-point lead in New Hampshire.\u00a0</p>", "<p>The polls also showed that in both Iowa and New Hampshire, Democratic voters said the top quality they want in a candidate is being honest and trustworthy, while experience and electability were less important.\u00a0</p>", "<p>Ed Henry currently serves as Fox News Channel's (FNC) chief White House correspondent.

But they warned that inherent physical differences and different injury rates between men and women will have an impact on how the integration moves ahead.</p>", "<p>The selective service question revealed differences between the military chiefs and their political leaders. Army Gen. Mark Milley and Marine Gen. Robert Neller both flatly said that women should be included in the requirement to register for the selective service at age 18. But Navy Secretary Ray Mabus and Army Acting Secretary Patrick Murphy would only say that the issue should be discussed. Political leaders overall have so far been reluctant to endorse the draft requirement.</p>", "<p>The sometimes contentious hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee laid bare the deep reluctance of Marine Corps leaders to bring women into certain demanding infantry, armor and special operations jobs.</p>", "<p>After a lengthy review by the services and the Pentagon, Defense Secretary Ash Carter in December ordered all combat jobs open to women, but also vowed that no standards would be lowered to make way for women.</p>", "<p>The Marine Corps initially sought to keep certain infantry and combat jobs closed to women, citing studies showing combined-gender units are not as effective as male-only units. Allowing women to compete for ground combat jobs, it concluded, would make the Marine Corps a less-efficient fighting machine.</p>", "<p>Both Mabus and Carter rejected that argument. In response, Marine leaders, including Neller, immediately began to lay out implementation plans, but they continue to make clear their reservations.</p>", "<p>\"We have a decision and we're in the process of moving out,\" Neller told the senators. \"We will see where the chips fall. And, again, our hope is that everyone will be successful. But hope is not a course of action on the battlefield.\"</p>", "<p>Neller said that Marine Corps testing revealed two significant differences between all-male units and those with men and women. He said all-male units were able to better march long distances carrying heavy loads and also were able to fire their weapons more accurately after marching over distance.</p>", "<p>Being big and strong and having a \"certain body mass give you an advantage,\" said Neller. He added that as women do more conditioning and weight training to meet combat standards, they have been more likely to be outside the required weight and size requirements for women. The Marine Corps, he said, is looking at that issue.</p>", "<p>Mabus and Neller have deep differences on how the Marine Corps should proceed, and provided their views in starkly different ways.</p>", "<p>Mabus presented a lengthy opening statement laying out his views and why he disagreed with the Marine's recommendation, and had to be warned by McCain to finish up quickly. Neller, meanwhile, made no opening statement, provided short, clipped answers to questions, and avoided most direct disagreements with Mabus.</p>", "<p>Asked to list his concerns, Neller said he's worried about retention, injury rates and unit effectiveness.</p>", "<p>Lawmakers, including McCain, criticized Mabus for deciding to allow women to compete for Marine combat jobs \u2014 and telling the media \u2014 before fully reading and taking into account the massive Marine study.</p>", "<p>\"You're handling of this issue has really complicated this issue for those of us who support integration,\" McCain snapped at Mabus at the end of the hearing.</p>", "<p>Milley said he fully supported allowing women to seek combat jobs, but cautioned that it should be done slowly and methodically because \"we must not rush to failure.\"</p>", "<p>The military leaders said that for the first time the services are developing standards that are specific to each job, based on the requirements and tasks that must be accomplished. Those standards, they said, will be applied equally for men and women.</p>", "<p>Milley added that at this point he does not expect that women will be forced into infantry jobs. The Army, he said, doesn't involuntarily send men to the combat post right now and the service is meeting all its needs. But, he said, things could change in the future depending on the military's needs.</p>", "<p>Carter's order to allow women to compete for combat posts opens the final 10 percent of military positions to women \u2014 a total of about 220,000 jobs. And it allows them to serve in the most demanding and difficult jobs, including as special operations forces, such as the Army Delta units and Navy SEALs.</p>"]}

Ted Cruz scored a decisive win over Donald Trump in the Republican caucuses, with Florida Sen. Marco Rubio a close third.\u00a0</p>", "<p>Early Tuesday, the Iowa Democratic Party said Clinton had been awarded 699.57 state delegate equivalents while Sanders had received 695.49 state delegate equivalents with one precinct outstanding. That precinct was worth 2.28 state delegate equivalents \u2014 not enough for Sanders to make up the deficit.</p>", "<p>The Clinton campaign quickly issued a statement declaring victory, saying, \"Statistically, there is no outstanding information that could change the results and no way that Senator Sanders can overcome Secretary Clinton's advantage.\" However, a number of news outlets, including Fox News, did not immediately call the contest for the former secretary of state.\u00a0</p>", "<p>In at least three precincts, the Democratic outcome was so close that party officials ordered a coin toss to determine which candidate should receive an extra county convention delegate, a longstanding tiebreaking method.

Sanders said the results sent a \u201cprofound message\u201d to the media and political establishment.</p>", "<p>Cruz, too, cast his victory as a message to the Republican establishment.</p>", "<p>\u201cTonight is a victory for the grassroots. Tonight is a victory for courageous conservatives across Iowa and all across this great nation,\u201d Cruz told cheering supporters.</p>", "<p>Speaking to supporters at Drake University, Clinton said she was \"breathing a big sigh of relief\" about the outcome.</p>", "<p>\"Thank you Iowa. I want you to know that I\u2019ll keep standing up for you, keep fighting for you. Join me. Let\u2019s go win that nomination,\u201d she said.</p>", "<p>Sanders noted that Iowa's 44 Democratic national convention delegates would be distributed almost evenly between the two candidates. The Associated Press reported that Clinton had captured at least 22 delegates to Sanders' 21, with the remaining one going to the statewide winner.\u00a0</p>", "<p>Sanders touched on familiar themes during his speech, saying his campaign was about the people and \u201cnot billionaires buying elections.\u201d</p>", "<p>En route to New Hampshire, where he holds a substantial lead in the polls ahead of the Feb. 9 primary, Sanders vowed, \"We're in this to the convention, and I think this [result] shows the American people we're a campaign that can win.\u200e\"</p>", "<p>In the Republican campaign, Cruz fought hard in recent weeks to make up lost ground in the polls and was helped in part by a sophisticated ground operation. He also hammered Trump for his decision to skip last week's Republican debate.\u00a0</p>", "<p>Meanwhile, Rubio's stronger-than-expected third place finish was helped in large part by late deciders. Entrance polling conducted by Fox News found that 35 percent of GOP caucus-goers made their choice within the last few days of the race. Of those, 30 percent broke for Rubio.</p>", "<p>Rubio's campaign also suggested Trump\u2019s debate boycott helped change the dynamic in the race.</p>", "<p>With all but one precinct reporting, Cruz had 28 percent, Trump had 24 percent and Rubio had 23 percent.\u00a0Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson placed a distant fourth in the race with 9 percent, while Kentucky Sen.

After seven years of Barack Obama, we are not waiting any longer to take our country back.\u201d\u00a0</p>", "<p>Trump, for his part, argued he beat initial expectations by placing second and predicted he'd still win in New Hampshire next week.\u00a0</p>", "<p>\u201cWe will go on to get the Republican nomination, and we will go on to easily beat Hillary or Bernie or whoever the hell they throw up\u00a0there,\u201d he said. He closed his speech by saying: \"I think I might come here and buy a farm, I love it.\u201d</p>", "<p>Republicans voted by private ballot. The state's 30 Republican delegates are awarded proportionally based on the vote, with at least eight delegates going to Cruz, seven to Trump and six to Rubio.</p>", "<p>Two candidates dropped their presidential bids after poor showings.

Mike Huckabee also suspended his campaign.\u00a0</p>", "<p>Interest and turnout were high on both sides. Republican officials said there were more than 180,000 people at Monday's GOP caucuses, up from the previous high of about 121,000 in 2012. The Iowa Democratic Party said their caucuses drew 171,109 supporters, well short of the record 240,000 caucus-goers in 2008.</p>", "<p>Several caucus sites remained open longer to accommodate long lines; some even ran out of registration forms or ballots.</p>", "<p>Cruz rose from the middle of the Republican pack last year to overtake Trump on Monday. His victory disrupts Trump's front-runner narrative and could jolt the GOP race, where candidates have struggled for months to arrest Trump\u2019s rise.\u00a0</p>", "<p>According to\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/elections/2016/primary-caucus-results/iowa\">entrance polling</a>\u00a0of Republican caucus-goers conducted by Fox News, Cruz won by garnering the support of evangelical Christians and those who wanted a candidate who shares their values. Evangelical Christians made up 62 percent of Republican caucus-goers \u2014 up from 56 percent in 2012 \u2014 and of those, 33 percent backed the Texas senator.\u00a0</p>", "<p>On the Democratic side, Sanders overwhelmed Clinton among caucus-goers under 30, a group that he won 84 percent to 14 percent. However, that constituency only made up 18 percent of all Democratic caucus-goers.\u00a0</p>", "<p>On the other hand, 55 percent of all Democratic caucus-goers said they wanted the next president to continue President Obama's policies. Clinton won the support of 68 percent of that constituency.</p>", "<p>The Iowa caucuses have had a mixed record in recent cycles, particularly on the Republican side, in picking the eventual nominees.\u00a0</p>", "<p>The GOP caucus winners in 2008 and 2012 were Huckabee and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, respectively, neither of whom won the nomination.</p>", "<p>Eight years ago, though, Obama\u2019s Iowa win helped set him on the trajectory to claim first the Democratic nomination, then the presidency.</p>", "<p><i>Fox News\u2019 Ed Henry and Jake Gibson and The Associated Press contributed to this report.</i></p>"]}

With only 23 delegates at stake in the 2016 GOP contest, New Hampshire doesn\u2019t have the heft of say, California, which will carry upwards of 172 Republican delegates to the nominating convention. Nevertheless, while New Hampshire\u2019s primary will take place on Feb. 9, the California primary isn't scheduled until June 7, long after a winner is likely to emerge.</p>", "<p>Other early primary contests include South Carolina\u2019s (Feb. 20) followed by Super Tuesday (March 1), which features 14 states from every corner of the country with a combined total of 653 pledged candidates at stake.</p>", "<p>The number of delegates each state gets is determined by the national party, typically based, but not exclusively, on the number of congressional districts in each state. How the delegates are won is determined at the state party level, which means there are widely varying rules across the country.</p>", "<p>Democratic candidates win delegates proportionate to the number of votes they get in that particular state primary. For example, if Hillary Clinton gets 60 percent of the vote in New Hampshire, she gets 60 percent of the pledged delegates there. State Republican parties have more discretion over how they apportion their delegates to winning candidates. Up until March 14 in next year\u2019s contests, they must adhere to a proportional formula similar to the Democrats. But after that date, states are free to tinker with the system, which may include a winner-take-all formula, or some sort of hybrid.</p>", "<p>Pledged delegates are committed to voting for the candidate who won them at the nominating convention. These delegates are typically local and state party officials, committee members, and party activists.\u00a0 Each state has super-delegates, as well, and they are not bound to any one candidate. They typically include elected officials and other party VIPs like former members of Congress, governors or ex-presidents. According to Ballotpedia, 15 percent of delegates in the 2016 Democratic convention are expected to be super-delegates.</p>", "<p>In the past four presidential election cycles, the winner of the GOP primary in New Hampshire went on to be the party\u2019s nominee. In 1996, Pat Buchanan won the state\u2019s contest, but ultimately lost to Bob Dole at the national convention. Hillary Clinton won the New Hampshire Democratic primary in 2008, but ultimately lost the nomination to Barack Obama.<br> </p>"]}

And once the news got to Capitol Hill, it set off alarm bells given the host country\u2019s proximity to Al Qaeda\u2019s most active branch.</p>", "<p>The transfer is the largest batch of detainees shipped out of the Cuba prison camp so far this year. It is part of a wave of transfers as the administration steps up efforts to shrink the prison population, with the ultimate goal of closing the facility despite congressional resistance.\u00a0</p>", "<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/01/12/ten-detainees-leaving-gitmo-in-bulk-transfer-thursday-defense-officials-say.html\">Fox News reported earlier this week</a> that the 10 detainees were slated for transfer, but the destination at the time was not known.

The Pentagon said the individuals \u201cwere unanimously approved for transfer by the six departments and agencies comprising the task force,\u201d and said the government is \u201cgrateful\u201d to Oman for its \u201chumanitarian gesture and willingness to support ongoing U.S. efforts to close the Guantanamo Bay detention facility.\u201d</p>", "<p>Ahead of the announcement, Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., slammed the transfer as a \u201cthinly veiled attempt to undercut the will of Congress and would further endanger the American people.\u201d</p>", "<p>The administration is banned by law from transferring Guantanamo detainees to Yemen, given the risk in that country. Yemen is not only racked by civil war, but is the home of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. At least three previously released Guantanamo detainees have gone on to become leaders with AQAP in Yemen after leaving the camp.</p>", "<p>Given that Oman neighbors Yemen, Ayotte described the move as a potential attempt to \u201ccircumvent\u201d the congressional ban on sending prisoners to Yemen.</p>", "<p>\u201cThis potential transfer is all the more troubling in light of the fact that Ibrahim al Qosi, who was released from Gitmo by the Obama administration in 2012, is now reportedly a leader and spokesman for AQAP,\u201d Ayotte said. \u201c\u2026 The administration has not been forthright with the American people about the terrorist affiliations and activities of these detainees, or provided sufficient assurances that they will not return to the battlefield, particularly given their possible proximity to Yemen.\u201d\u00a0</p>", "<p>The transfer also coincides with a recent weapons deal. The terms are classified, but the State Department a week ago approved the proposed sale of TOW 2B missiles and supporting equipment to the government of Oman \u2013 valued at about $51 million.</p>", "<p>The department said the sale would help an ally build its ground defenses and bolster the country's national security and defensive capabilities.</p>", "<p>A State Department official told Fox News, though, that the deal and the detainee transfer are unrelated.\u00a0</p>", "<p>The transfer brings the number of remaining detainees to 93.</p>", "<p>The transfers are part of an administration effort to bring down the prison camp\u2019s population as much as possible. Fifty-nine prisoners, however, currently are not eligible for transfer abroad, and the administration is trying to figure out what to do with them.</p>", "<p>Though Congress has blocked transfers to the United States, the Pentagon nevertheless has conducted a series of site surveys of prisons in the U.S. in the past few months.\u00a0</p>", "<p>President Obama reiterated his goal of closing the camp in his State of the Union address on Tuesday.</p>", "<p><i>Fox News' Catherine Herridge and Lucas Tomlinson contributed to this report.\u00a0</i></p>"]}

How the delegates are won is determined at the state party level, which means there are widely varying rules across the country.</p>", "<p>Democratic candidates win delegates proportionate to the number of votes they get in that particular state primary. For example, if Hillary Clinton gets 60 percent of the vote in New Hampshire, she gets 60 percent of the pledged delegates there. State Republican parties have more discretion over how they apportion their delegates to winning candidates. Up until March 14 in next year\u2019s contests, they must adhere to a proportional formula similar to the Democrats. But after that date, states are free to tinker with the system, which may include a winner-take-all formula, or some sort of hybrid.</p>", "<p>Pledged delegates are committed to voting for the candidate who won them at the nominating convention.

It does not explain who advised the headquarters of this problem or its apparent cause.</p>", "<p>A large-scale search-and-rescue mission was undertaken at that point, but it is not clear whether the Americans had by this time already been taken ashore on Farsi Island. Aircraft from the USS Harry S. Truman aircraft carrier, which was operating 45 miles southeast of Farsi Island, participated in the search, along with Air Force planes and vessels of the U.S. Coast Guard, the British Royal Navy and other U.S. Navy vessels.</p>", "<p>Central Command's naval headquarters at Bahrain attempted to contact Iranian military units operating near Farsi Island by using marine radio to broadcast information about the search-and-rescue operation. Separately, the U.S. notified Iranian coast guard units via telephone. Some hours later, about four hours after the U.S. first heard that the sailors were being questioned by Iranians, the U.S. Navy cruiser USS Anzio received word from the Iranians that the sailors were in Iranian custody. The Iranians described the 10 as \"safe and healthy,\" according to the U.S. account.</p>", "<p>In the hours after the seizure of the Americans became public on Jan. 12, there were conflicting reports about what caused the sailors to stray off their intended course. Monday's official account did not explain the reason. It said only that the crews \"deviated\" from their planned course. It made no reference to the navigation error cited by Carter last week.</p>", "<p>\"At some point one (of the two boats) had indications of a mechanical issue in a diesel engine which caused the crews to stop . and begin troubleshooting,\" the account said. Because the boats were traveling together, the other boat also stopped. At this point they were in Iranian territorial waters, \"although it's not clear the crew was aware of their exact location,\" it added.</p>", "<p>While the boats were stopped and the crew was trying to assess the mechanical problem, Iranian boats approached. First to arrive were two small Iranian craft with armed personnel aboard. Soon after, they were joined by two more Iranian military vessels. A verbal exchange ensued between the Iranians and Americans, but there was no gunfire.</p>", "<p>Armed Iranian military personnel then boarded the U.S. boats while other Iranian personnel aboard other armed vessels monitored the situation.

Barring the purchase of the Russian engines could delay important missions during that transition period, they said, while also undercutting the competition among American companies essential to ensuring costs stay under control.</p>", "<p>United Launch Alliance spokeswoman Jessica Rye said the company had no comment.</p>", "<p>The debate over the Russian equipment also illustrates a longstanding tension between congressional committees that have similar yet distinct responsibilities. McCain's panel is an authorization committee that writes defense policy and approves annual military spending levels. But the appropriations committees actually allot the money, and their actions can occasionally contradict what the authorizers decided.</p>", "<p>During a December floor speech, McCain said Shelby and Durbin, both senior members of the Senate Appropriations Committee, reversed a restriction on buying the engines in what McCain called a \"triumph of pork-barrel parochialism.\" Their provision was added -- \"in secret, with no debate,\" McCain said -- to a $1.1 trillion government-wide spending bill passed by Congress late last year and signed into law by President Barack Obama.</p>", "<p>United Launch Alliance, which uses the RD-180s on its Atlas V launch vehicle, has manufacturing facilities in Decatur, Alabama. Defense industry giants Boeing, based in Chicago, and Lockheed Martin formed United Launch Alliance as a joint venture. Shelby, who faces a GOP primary challenge, helped craft the spending bill but then ended up voting against it because the bill didn't tighten the vetting process for Syrian refugees seeking to enter the United States.</p>", "<p>Over the past two years, McCain said, his committee supported measures also approved by Congress that prohibited the Russian engines but allowed a small number to be used during the transition period if the engines were fully paid for before Feb. 1, 2014 -- just weeks before Russia invaded Ukraine.</p>", "<p>Durbin, also speaking on the Senate floor last month, said nothing was done in secret. He said Defense Department officials told him and other lawmakers that excluding the Russian engines so quickly could leave the Air Force short of all the rockets needed to launch satellites essential to national security. Durbin also said it prevents United Launch Alliance from bidding on military work, leaving the company SpaceX as the \"monopoly source for the engines.\"</p>", "<p>SpaceX, a rocket and spacecraft builder, is based in Hawthorne, California, McCarthy's home state.</p>"]}

Ghani took office in September 2014 and Campbell has said publicly that the new president's approach to the war effort and that of his predecessor, Hamid Karzai, were like \"night and day,\" from the U.S. point of view.

House Speaker Paul Ryan said the effort to force enactment of the bill, which would have also ended federal payments to Planned Parenthood, would send an important signal.</p>", "<p>\"What we're proving today is if we have a Republican president next year, we will repeal Obamacare,\" Ryan, R-Wis., told reporters, using a nickname for a law that GOP lawmakers have despised since it was pushed through Congress six years ago.</p>", "<p>Ryan said the GOP will offer its own proposal this year for replacing the law, saying it would lower costs and \"restore the doctor-patient relationship.\" Republicans have struggled unsuccessfully for years to coalesce behind a replacement plan.</p>", "<p>Democrats mocked the GOP for trying yet again \u2014 and on Groundhog Day, no less \u2014 to kill or curb the law. Democrats said Tuesday's vote marked the 63rd such effort since Republicans took control of the House in 2011, and cited estimates from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office that the rollback would end medical care for 22 million Americans.</p>", "<p>Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., called the measure \"probably one of the saddest examples of a Congress run amok.\"</p>", "<p>Van Hollen also said Republicans had \"a lot of gall\" to try blocking Planned Parenthood's federal money a week after a grand jury in Texas found no wrongdoing by the organization and instead indicted anti-abortion activists who had secretly filmed videos of the group's officials.</p>", "<p>Republican efforts to halt funding for Planned Parenthood escalated last year after the videos showed its officials discussing how they sometimes furnish fetal tissue to scientists. Opponents said the tissue is provided illegally, but the group denies that and videos and several congressional investigations have unearthed no evidence of unlawfulness.</p>", "<p>Democrats were also trying to leverage Tuesday's vote, with political committees backing House and Senate Democrats emailing supporters looking to stir up support and perhaps contributions.</p>", "<p>The\u00a0vetoed\u00a0bill would annul major parts of the health care law, effectively repealing its requirements that most people obtain insurance and that large companies offer their employees coverage. It would also void the statute's option for states to expand Medicaid coverage to more low-income people and abolish taxes the law imposed, such as on upper-income people and high value insurance policies.</p>", "<p>The budget office estimated that the\u00a0vetoed\u00a0bill, if enacted, would save $318 billion over a decade.</p>", "<p>Tellingly, leaders have not said Congress would necessarily vote on a Republican health care law this year.

But they warned that inherent physical differences and different injury rates between men and women will have an impact on how the integration moves ahead.</p>", "<p>The selective service question revealed differences between the military chiefs and their political leaders. Army Gen. Mark Milley and Marine Gen. Robert Neller both flatly said that women should be included in the requirement to register for the selective service at age 18. But Navy Secretary Ray Mabus and Army Acting Secretary Patrick Murphy would only say that the issue should be discussed. Political leaders overall have so far been reluctant to endorse the draft requirement.</p>", "<p>The sometimes contentious hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee laid bare the deep reluctance of Marine Corps leaders to bring women into certain demanding infantry, armor and special operations jobs.</p>", "<p>After a lengthy review by the services and the Pentagon, Defense Secretary Ash Carter in December ordered all combat jobs open to women, but also vowed that no standards would be lowered to make way for women.</p>", "<p>The Marine Corps initially sought to keep certain infantry and combat jobs closed to women, citing studies showing combined-gender units are not as effective as male-only units. Allowing women to compete for ground combat jobs, it concluded, would make the Marine Corps a less-efficient fighting machine.</p>", "<p>Both Mabus and Carter rejected that argument. In response, Marine leaders, including Neller, immediately began to lay out implementation plans, but they continue to make clear their reservations.</p>", "<p>\"We have a decision and we're in the process of moving out,\" Neller told the senators. \"We will see where the chips fall. And, again, our hope is that everyone will be successful. But hope is not a course of action on the battlefield.\"</p>", "<p>Neller said that Marine Corps testing revealed two significant differences between all-male units and those with men and women. He said all-male units were able to better march long distances carrying heavy loads and also were able to fire their weapons more accurately after marching over distance.</p>", "<p>Being big and strong and having a \"certain body mass give you an advantage,\" said Neller. He added that as women do more conditioning and weight training to meet combat standards, they have been more likely to be outside the required weight and size requirements for women. The Marine Corps, he said, is looking at that issue.</p>", "<p>Mabus and Neller have deep differences on how the Marine Corps should proceed, and provided their views in starkly different ways.</p>", "<p>Mabus presented a lengthy opening statement laying out his views and why he disagreed with the Marine's recommendation, and had to be warned by McCain to finish up quickly. Neller, meanwhile, made no opening statement, provided short, clipped answers to questions, and avoided most direct disagreements with Mabus.</p>", "<p>Asked to list his concerns, Neller said he's worried about retention, injury rates and unit effectiveness.</p>", "<p>Lawmakers, including McCain, criticized Mabus for deciding to allow women to compete for Marine combat jobs \u2014 and telling the media \u2014 before fully reading and taking into account the massive Marine study.</p>", "<p>\"You're handling of this issue has really complicated this issue for those of us who support integration,\" McCain snapped at Mabus at the end of the hearing.</p>", "<p>Milley said he fully supported allowing women to seek combat jobs, but cautioned that it should be done slowly and methodically because \"we must not rush to failure.\"</p>", "<p>The military leaders said that for the first time the services are developing standards that are specific to each job, based on the requirements and tasks that must be accomplished. Those standards, they said, will be applied equally for men and women.</p>", "<p>Milley added that at this point he does not expect that women will be forced into infantry jobs. The Army, he said, doesn't involuntarily send men to the combat post right now and the service is meeting all its needs. But, he said, things could change in the future depending on the military's needs.</p>", "<p>Carter's order to allow women to compete for combat posts opens the final 10 percent of military positions to women \u2014 a total of about 220,000 jobs. And it allows them to serve in the most demanding and difficult jobs, including as special operations forces, such as the Army Delta units and Navy SEALs.</p>"]}

The press and the Republican power brokers originally viewed him as a middle-tier guy, a bomb-thrower in Washington, and not a charming personality to boot.</p>", "<p>He stuck to his strategy of hard-line conservatism, courting evangelicals, bashing the media\u2014and parrying Trump\u2019s assaults better than any other Republican candidate.<br> <br> Cruz appeared to be slipping in recent weeks as Trump questioned his Canadian birth and called him a nasty guy, and he had his worst debate in last week\u2019s Fox faceoff in Iowa. But he had a resilient base of support in this state.<br> <br> For Trump, the loss clearly dents his shield of invulnerability. But a billionaire mocked by much of the establishment showed he could mount a competitive race, he's far stronger in New Hampshire and South Carolina, and he has all the money he needs. Perhaps a dose of humility will be good for him.<br> <br> It\u2019s hard to know whether Trump skipping the Fox debate was a factor among late deciders, or his big-rallies-over-county-fairs approach. We do know that Cruz had a much stronger ground game, and with Iowa\u2019s complicated caucuses, that still matters.<br> <br> Rubio\u2019s surprisingly strong third-place finish, which put him close to Trump, vindicates his strategy of trying to emerge as the establishment alternative. The Florida senator got traction at just the right time, brilliantly managed the expectations game, and comes out of Iowa (where he didn't play that hard) firmly in the top tier with Trump and Cruz, heading into better states for him.<br> <br> But before we get completely swept away by the media hype, Iowa, with its strong evangelical vote, is a unique battleground. Four of the last GOP winners in Iowa have failed to win the nomination. In just eight days, Trump could be buoyed by a huge victory in New Hampshire. The Iowa afterglow is intense, but short-lived.</p>", "<p>On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton was leading Bernie Sanders by an extraordinarily thin margin, possibly avoiding the possibility of an 0-for-2 start in the state that crushed her hopes against Barack Obama.

A former first lady, a former secretary of State, a Clinton, should clobber a 74-year-old socialist who hadn\u2019t even been a member of the Democratic Party. But she is an establishment candidate in an anti-establishment year. Whatever the final numbers, this is a moral victory for Sanders and certification of his grass-roots appeal.<br> <br> What\u2019s striking among Republicans is how the last two Iowa winners, Rick Santorum and Mike Huckabee, finished below 2 percent, along with once-hot contender Carly Fiorina and Chris Christie, who is betting his campaign on New Hampshire.</p>", "<p>The early signs were good for Trump, as one wave of Fox entrance polls showed Trump barely trailing Cruz among evangelical Christians, Iowa\u2019s key voting bloc, 26 to 24 percent\u2014with Rubio at 21 percent. Those voters are Cruz\u2019s key constituency, and perhaps he lost some crucial supporters to Ben Carson, who hung in at about 10 percent.</p>", "<p>The entrance polls showed Trump dominating among voters whose most important quality was a candidate who \u201ctells it like it is.\u201d Cruz did best among voters seeking a candidate who \u201cshares my values.\u201d Rubio was strongest as the candidate who \u201ccan win in November.\u201d</p>", "<p>Demographically, Trump did best among voters with a high school education or less, while Rubio edged Cruz among college graduates and those who did postgraduate study. Cruz, not surprisingly, did best among very conservative voters, Trump scored highest with moderate voters, and Trump and Rubio were essentially tied among somewhat conservative voters.</p>", "<p>On the Democratic side, according to those entrance polls, Hillary Clinton dominated among voters over 65, while Bernie Sanders clobbered her in the 17-to-29 age group.</p>", "<p>Sanders decimated the former first lady among those most interested in an \u201chonest and trustworthy\u201d candidate and one who \u201ccares about people like me.\u201d Clinton creamed him for having \u201cthe right experience\u201d and as someone who \u201ccan win in November.\u201d</p>", "<p>Howard Kurtz is a Fox News analyst and the host of <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/media-buzz/index.html\">\"MediaBuzz\"</a> (Sundays 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. ET).

It said a post-recovery inventory of the boats found that all weapons, ammunition and communications gear was accounted for, minus two SIM cards apparently removed from two hand-held satellite phones.</p>", "<p>The sailors were traveling in small armed vessels known as riverine command boats, headed from Kuwait to Bahrain, which is the location of the Navy's 5th Fleet.</p>", "<p>\"The planned transit path for the mission was down the middle of the Gulf and not through the territorial waters of any country other than Kuwait and Bahrain,\" the account said.

Aircraft from the USS Harry S. Truman aircraft carrier, which was operating 45 miles southeast of Farsi Island, participated in the search, along with Air Force planes and vessels of the U.S. Coast Guard, the British Royal Navy and other U.S. Navy vessels.</p>", "<p>Central Command's naval headquarters at Bahrain attempted to contact Iranian military units operating near Farsi Island by using marine radio to broadcast information about the search-and-rescue operation. Separately, the U.S. notified Iranian coast guard units via telephone. Some hours later, about four hours after the U.S. first heard that the sailors were being questioned by Iranians, the U.S. Navy cruiser USS Anzio received word from the Iranians that the sailors were in Iranian custody. The Iranians described the 10 as \"safe and healthy,\" according to the U.S. account.</p>", "<p>In the hours after the seizure of the Americans became public on Jan. 12, there were conflicting reports about what caused the sailors to stray off their intended course. Monday's official account did not explain the reason. It said only that the crews \"deviated\" from their planned course. It made no reference to the navigation error cited by Carter last week.</p>", "<p>\"At some point one (of the two boats) had indications of a mechanical issue in a diesel engine which caused the crews to stop . and begin troubleshooting,\" the account said. Because the boats were traveling together, the other boat also stopped. At this point they were in Iranian territorial waters, \"although it's not clear the crew was aware of their exact location,\" it added.</p>", "<p>While the boats were stopped and the crew was trying to assess the mechanical problem, Iranian boats approached. First to arrive were two small Iranian craft with armed personnel aboard. Soon after, they were joined by two more Iranian military vessels. A verbal exchange ensued between the Iranians and Americans, but there was no gunfire.</p>", "<p>Armed Iranian military personnel then boarded the U.S. boats while other Iranian personnel aboard other armed vessels monitored the situation. At gunpoint the U.S. boats and their crews were escorted to a small port facility on Farsi Island, where the Americans went ashore and were detained, the account said.</p>", "<p>The sailors were released the following morning aboard their boats.</p>", "<p>\u00a0</p>"]}

He frittered away an early commanding lead here by both failing to get serious about courting voters soon enough, capping it off by snubbing Iowa\u2019s only Republican presidential debate.\u00a0<br> <br> He underperformed the average of pre-election polls by more than 5 points, losing despite having led in the final 13 polls.\u00a0<br> <br> But despite some of Trump\u2019s past rhetoric about losing losers and the losses they lose, a second-place finish in a state hardly suited to a Northeastern social moderate isn\u2019t a disaster. And in his concession speech, he struck an unexpectedly gracious note about the Iowans who spurned him.<br> <br> Despite underperforming, Trump showed that his left-right coalition of voters is real and will turn out, even for a caucus. If he is willing to learn his lessons, Trump could be a formidable contender for the nomination. Those lessons include the need to start advertising and organizing (i.e. spending money) sooner and facing down challenges like debates rather than trying to avoid them.<br> <br> How he responds to this adversity will tell us a great deal. He holds an astonishing 21-point lead in the Real Clear Politics average of New Hampshire polls and can fairly well bank on a win there on Feb. 9. That\u2019s the kind of comeback he needs.It certainly worked for\u00a0<b>Mitt Romney</b>.<br> <br> But the real problem for Trump in Iowa was not that he underperformed \u2013 hardly surprising given his status as a celebrity candidate with limited organization \u2013 but how the rest of his party behaved.</p>", "<p>First, what promises to be a sustained anti-Trump effort made its debut in Iowa and obviously did some damage. The Our Principles PAC and other pro-GOP groups will keep the heat on Trump as the race rolls on. It was overdue move for a party on the brink of a crackup.</p>", "<p>But that takes nothing away from the victory of Sen.\u00a0<b>Ted Cruz</b>, R-Texas, who out worked, out spent and out hustled Trump. And in so doing, Cruz mopped up the rest of the right-wing vote.\u00a0<b>Ben Carson</b>, Sen.\u00a0<b>Rand Paul</b>, R-Ky., former Sen.\u00a0<b>Rick Santorum</b>, R-Pa., and former Arkansas Gov.\u00a0<b>Mike Huckabee</b>, who has already bowed out, won\u2019t make it out of Iowa.</p>", "<p>With none of them even close, Cruz can keep his focus on Trump. Even with an acceptance speech that seemed like it would go on until the polls opened in Dixville Notch, N.H., Cruz now has the momentum, money and organization to go the distance.<br> <br> And the same is true for Sen.\u00a0<b>Marco Rubio</b>, who was the surprise story of Iowa. His rivals, particularly former Florida Gov.\u00a0<b>Jeb Bush</b>\u00a0may claim a sixth-place finish after his organization dumped more cash in the state than any other candidate, isn\u2019t relevant to the next round of contests, but you can stick a fork in him.\u00a0<br> <br> The same goes for Gov.\u00a0<b>Chris Christie</b>, R-N.J., whose 10<sup>th\u00a0</sup>place showing will dry up support in upcoming states quicker than a roll of Bounty. You don\u2019t have to win Iowa, but you darned well better be on the first page of the results.<br> <br> What makes Rubio\u2019s third-place finish, just shy of Trump\u2019s second spot, even more significant is that late-breaking voters surged to him. Every poll suggested that a turnout surge like the one we saw would mean a massive Trump win, but Rubio was the real beneficiary.<br> <br> If the traditional GOP is consolidating around Rubio this soon, that means Trump will find himself unable to continue to make his case to the Washington establishment that he is a better bad choice than Cruz. Rather than forming his unlikely alliance between pitchfork populism and K Street dealmakers, Trump will have to fight a two-front war.</p>", "<p>In Rubio, Republicans are finding a candidate they can live with who also stacks up best against\u00a0<b>Hillary Clinton</b>. And Iowa just made him a very dangerous man for both Trump and Cruz.</p>", "<p><b>WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE\u2026<br> </b>While many were either preparing, or hearing endlessly about the massive snowstorm that hit the East Coast a few weeks ago one agency hunkered down.

This camera will soon be launched into deep space, to image the first stars to flare into being after the Big Bang, and maybe, if we are very lucky, the exhaled gases of life forms that live in the atmospheres of distant planets.\u201d</p>", "<p><b>Got\u00a0</b>a\u00a0<b>TIP\u00a0</b>from the\u00a0<b>RIGHT</b>\u00a0or the\u00a0<b>LEFT</b>?

And once the news got to Capitol Hill, it set off alarm bells given the host country\u2019s proximity to Al Qaeda\u2019s most active branch.</p>", "<p>The transfer is the largest batch of detainees shipped out of the Cuba prison camp so far this year. It is part of a wave of transfers as the administration steps up efforts to shrink the prison population, with the ultimate goal of closing the facility despite congressional resistance.\u00a0</p>", "<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/01/12/ten-detainees-leaving-gitmo-in-bulk-transfer-thursday-defense-officials-say.html\">Fox News reported earlier this week</a> that the 10 detainees were slated for transfer, but the destination at the time was not known.

The Pentagon said the individuals \u201cwere unanimously approved for transfer by the six departments and agencies comprising the task force,\u201d and said the government is \u201cgrateful\u201d to Oman for its \u201chumanitarian gesture and willingness to support ongoing U.S. efforts to close the Guantanamo Bay detention facility.\u201d</p>", "<p>Ahead of the announcement, Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., slammed the transfer as a \u201cthinly veiled attempt to undercut the will of Congress and would further endanger the American people.\u201d</p>", "<p>The administration is banned by law from transferring Guantanamo detainees to Yemen, given the risk in that country. Yemen is not only racked by civil war, but is the home of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. At least three previously released Guantanamo detainees have gone on to become leaders with AQAP in Yemen after leaving the camp.</p>", "<p>Given that Oman neighbors Yemen, Ayotte described the move as a potential attempt to \u201ccircumvent\u201d the congressional ban on sending prisoners to Yemen.</p>", "<p>\u201cThis potential transfer is all the more troubling in light of the fact that Ibrahim al Qosi, who was released from Gitmo by the Obama administration in 2012, is now reportedly a leader and spokesman for AQAP,\u201d Ayotte said. \u201c\u2026 The administration has not been forthright with the American people about the terrorist affiliations and activities of these detainees, or provided sufficient assurances that they will not return to the battlefield, particularly given their possible proximity to Yemen.\u201d\u00a0</p>", "<p>The transfer also coincides with a recent weapons deal. The terms are classified, but the State Department a week ago approved the proposed sale of TOW 2B missiles and supporting equipment to the government of Oman \u2013 valued at about $51 million.</p>", "<p>The department said the sale would help an ally build its ground defenses and bolster the country's national security and defensive capabilities.</p>", "<p>A State Department official told Fox News, though, that the deal and the detainee transfer are unrelated.\u00a0</p>", "<p>The transfer brings the number of remaining detainees to 93.</p>", "<p>The transfers are part of an administration effort to bring down the prison camp\u2019s population as much as possible. Fifty-nine prisoners, however, currently are not eligible for transfer abroad, and the administration is trying to figure out what to do with them.</p>", "<p>Though Congress has blocked transfers to the United States, the Pentagon nevertheless has conducted a series of site surveys of prisons in the U.S. in the past few months.\u00a0</p>", "<p>President Obama reiterated his goal of closing the camp in his State of the Union address on Tuesday.</p>", "<p><i>Fox News' Catherine Herridge and Lucas Tomlinson contributed to this report.\u00a0</i></p>"]}

At the end of 2014, the White House declared an end to combat operations there. Yet American forces and money remain committed as Afghan troops and police slowly take over the fighting.</p>", "<p>The mission of the U.S. troops in Afghanistan is to conduct counterterrorism operations and to train and assist the Afghan security forces. Nicholson assured the Senate Armed Services Committee during his confirmation hearing last week that he would do a thorough review to make sure there are enough American forces to accomplish both assignments.</p>", "<p>Nicholson acknowledged, however, that security conditions are worsening in Afghanistan. The Afghans held their own in 2015 during combat against the insurgency, he said, but are still not self-sustaining. The U.S. continues to provide the bulk of the money to train and equip the Afghan military and police -- more than $4.1 billion was allotted in fiscal year 2015 alone to the Afghanistan Security Forces Fund, according to the Defense Department.</p>", "<p>\"The Taliban came at the (Afghan forces) more intensely than perhaps we anticipated,\" Nicholson said. \"Because of that, we did not make the advances we projected we thought we would make.\"</p>", "<p>Overall, the U.S. has committed $113 billion since 2002 for reconstruction projects in hopes of establishing a stable, functioning Afghan government. Yet, nearly 15 years later, Afghanistan still lacks the capacity to independently operate and maintain the hospitals, roads, power plants, and more built with all the money.</p>"]}

Gen. John W. \"Mick\" Nicholson, Jr., a veteran of multiple Afghan war deployments, as the next top American commander in Kabul, officials said Wednesday.</p>", "<p>If his selection is confirmed by the Senate, Nicholson would succeed Gen. John F. Campbell, who is expected to retire.</p>", "<p>In announcing the Nicholson nomination, Pentagon press secretary Peter Cook quoted Defense Secretary Ash Carter as expressing gratitude for Campbell's contributions, saying he has helped put Afghanistan on a \"better path.\"</p>", "<p>\"Much of the credit for that progress rests with General Campbell,\" he quoted Carter as saying. \"For nearly 18 months General Campbell has given his all to the mission as our top commander in Afghanistan, and his personal sacrifices on behalf of his troops and the Afghan people will be remembered by us all.\"</p>", "<p>Nicholson, a 1982 graduate of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point and a career infantry officer, is currently commander of NATO's Allied Land Command, headquartered at Izmir, Turkey. Among numerous tours of duty in Afghanistan starting in 2006, he served as deputy chief of staff of operations for the international military command and for U.S. forces in 2010. Before that he spent 14 months as director of the Pentagon's Afghanistan-Pakistan coordination cell.</p>", "<p>Carter said he has confidence in Nicholson, calling him \"an accomplished soldier with extensive command experience both in Afghanistan and around the world.\"</p>", "<p>Campbell has been the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan since August 2014 and was due to be replaced. In recent weeks he was offered, but chose not to accept, command of U.S. Africa Command. Some thought he would have been a more natural fit to lead U.S. Central Command, which oversees operations in the Middle East, but Defense Secretary Ash Carter announced last week that Gen. Joseph Votel is President Barack Obama's choice for that job. Votel currently heads U.S. Special Operations Command.</p>", "<p>Campbell, a former vice chief of staff of the Army and an Iraq war veteran, is expected to complete his tour shortly, possibly around March 1. The House Armed Services Committee said this week that Campbell will testify on the situation in Afghanistan next Tuesday.</p>", "<p>The coming change in command of U.S. and allied forces in Afghanistan coincides with concern about a Taliban comeback, dysfunction in the Afghan government and shortcomings in U.S.-trained Afghan security forces after 14 years of war.</p>", "<p>There are about 9,800 U.S. troops in Afghanistan. At Campbell's urging, Obama decided last October to abandon his plan to reduce troop levels to near zero by the end of 2016. Instead he said they would shrink to 5,500 by the end of the year. Some suggest that Obama may be asked this year to maintain the current level of 9,800 troops until he leaves office in January 2017.</p>", "<p>It was during Campbell's tenure in Kabul that the U.S.-Afghan relationship took a turn for the better, largely because of the election of Ashraf Ghani as president. Ghani took office in September 2014 and Campbell has said publicly that the new president's approach to the war effort and that of his predecessor, Hamid Karzai, were like \"night and day,\" from the U.S. point of view. It was partly on that basis that Campbell recommended the U.S. not wind down its role as quickly as Obama once wanted.</p>"]}

John McCain, R-Ariz., said at a hearing to examine military space launch capabilities.</p>", "<p>Yet McCain said the Pentagon has actively sought to undermine the committee's direction to limit that risk and end the use of the Russian RD-180 engines by the end of this decade. McCain also blamed the U.S. contractor that acquires the engines, United Launch Alliance, and two senators who support the company, Richard Shelby, R-Ala., and Dick Durbin, D-Ill., for thwarting the committee's instructions.</p>", "<p>Air Force Secretary Deborah James told the committee the department is working to end the use of the Russian engines as soon as possible. She said disengaging from use of the Russian engines is far more complicated than it appears. She recommended a stockpile of 18 of the RD-180s until an American-made rocket can be tested and fielded.</p>", "<p>McCain and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., are introducing legislation Thursday to repeal a provision in law that they say allows the unlimited acquisition and use of RD-180 engines, which are manufactured by NPO Energomash. The manufacturer is owned primarily by the Russian government and controlled by several of Putin's confidants, according to the lawmakers.</p>", "<p>United Launch Alliance is under contract with the Air Force to launch military and spy satellites. The purchases effectively reward Putin's inner circle even as Washington continues to condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine's Crimea region, its continued support for Syrian President Bashar Assad, and other hostile actions, the lawmakers said.</p>", "<p>\"The benefits to Vladimir Putin, his network of corruption, and the Russian military industrial complex\" are well known, McCain said Wednesday. \"Yet despite the availability of alternatives, a select few still want to prolong our dependence on Russia while they target our satellites, occupy Crimea, destabilize Ukraine, bolster Assad in Syria, send weapons to Iran, and violate the 1987 Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty.\"</p>", "<p>Yury Melnik, a spokesman for the Russian Embassy in Washington, said Russia considers congressional discussions about the RD-180 \"an internal U.S. matter\" and would not comment on \"specific remarks by different lawmakers.\"</p>", "<p>Proponents of using the RD-180s to launch a range of national security satellites said the Russian engines fill a crucial gap while the U.S. develops and tests a domestically made rocket. Barring the purchase of the Russian engines could delay important missions during that transition period, they said, while also undercutting the competition among American companies essential to ensuring costs stay under control.</p>", "<p>United Launch Alliance spokeswoman Jessica Rye said the company had no comment.</p>", "<p>The debate over the Russian equipment also illustrates a longstanding tension between congressional committees that have similar yet distinct responsibilities. McCain's panel is an authorization committee that writes defense policy and approves annual military spending levels. But the appropriations committees actually allot the money, and their actions can occasionally contradict what the authorizers decided.</p>", "<p>During a December floor speech, McCain said Shelby and Durbin, both senior members of the Senate Appropriations Committee, reversed a restriction on buying the engines in what McCain called a \"triumph of pork-barrel parochialism.\" Their provision was added -- \"in secret, with no debate,\" McCain said -- to a $1.1 trillion government-wide spending bill passed by Congress late last year and signed into law by President Barack Obama.</p>", "<p>United Launch Alliance, which uses the RD-180s on its Atlas V launch vehicle, has manufacturing facilities in Decatur, Alabama. Defense industry giants Boeing, based in Chicago, and Lockheed Martin formed United Launch Alliance as a joint venture. Shelby, who faces a GOP primary challenge, helped craft the spending bill but then ended up voting against it because the bill didn't tighten the vetting process for Syrian refugees seeking to enter the United States.</p>", "<p>Over the past two years, McCain said, his committee supported measures also approved by Congress that prohibited the Russian engines but allowed a small number to be used during the transition period if the engines were fully paid for before Feb. 1, 2014 -- just weeks before Russia invaded Ukraine.</p>", "<p>Durbin, also speaking on the Senate floor last month, said nothing was done in secret. He said Defense Department officials told him and other lawmakers that excluding the Russian engines so quickly could leave the Air Force short of all the rockets needed to launch satellites essential to national security. Durbin also said it prevents United Launch Alliance from bidding on military work, leaving the company SpaceX as the \"monopoly source for the engines.\"</p>", "<p>SpaceX, a rocket and spacecraft builder, is based in Hawthorne, California, McCarthy's home state.</p>"]}

He frittered away an early commanding lead here by both failing to get serious about courting voters soon enough, capping it off by snubbing Iowa\u2019s only Republican presidential debate.\u00a0<br> <br> He underperformed the average of pre-election polls by more than 5 points, losing despite having led in the final 13 polls.\u00a0<br> <br> But despite some of Trump\u2019s past rhetoric about losing losers and the losses they lose, a second-place finish in a state hardly suited to a Northeastern social moderate isn\u2019t a disaster. And in his concession speech, he struck an unexpectedly gracious note about the Iowans who spurned him.<br> <br> Despite underperforming, Trump showed that his left-right coalition of voters is real and will turn out, even for a caucus. If he is willing to learn his lessons, Trump could be a formidable contender for the nomination. Those lessons include the need to start advertising and organizing (i.e. spending money) sooner and facing down challenges like debates rather than trying to avoid them.<br> <br> How he responds to this adversity will tell us a great deal. He holds an astonishing 21-point lead in the Real Clear Politics average of New Hampshire polls and can fairly well bank on a win there on Feb. 9. That\u2019s the kind of comeback he needs.It certainly worked for\u00a0<b>Mitt Romney</b>.<br> <br> But the real problem for Trump in Iowa was not that he underperformed \u2013 hardly surprising given his status as a celebrity candidate with limited organization \u2013 but how the rest of his party behaved.</p>", "<p>First, what promises to be a sustained anti-Trump effort made its debut in Iowa and obviously did some damage. The Our Principles PAC and other pro-GOP groups will keep the heat on Trump as the race rolls on. It was overdue move for a party on the brink of a crackup.</p>", "<p>But that takes nothing away from the victory of Sen.\u00a0<b>Ted Cruz</b>, R-Texas, who out worked, out spent and out hustled Trump. And in so doing, Cruz mopped up the rest of the right-wing vote.\u00a0<b>Ben Carson</b>, Sen.\u00a0<b>Rand Paul</b>, R-Ky., former Sen.\u00a0<b>Rick Santorum</b>, R-Pa., and former Arkansas Gov.\u00a0<b>Mike Huckabee</b>, who has already bowed out, won\u2019t make it out of Iowa.</p>", "<p>With none of them even close, Cruz can keep his focus on Trump. Even with an acceptance speech that seemed like it would go on until the polls opened in Dixville Notch, N.H., Cruz now has the momentum, money and organization to go the distance.<br> <br> And the same is true for Sen.\u00a0<b>Marco Rubio</b>, who was the surprise story of Iowa. His rivals, particularly former Florida Gov.\u00a0<b>Jeb Bush</b>\u00a0may claim a sixth-place finish after his organization dumped more cash in the state than any other candidate, isn\u2019t relevant to the next round of contests, but you can stick a fork in him.\u00a0<br> <br> The same goes for Gov.\u00a0<b>Chris Christie</b>, R-N.J., whose 10<sup>th\u00a0</sup>place showing will dry up support in upcoming states quicker than a roll of Bounty. You don\u2019t have to win Iowa, but you darned well better be on the first page of the results.<br> <br> What makes Rubio\u2019s third-place finish, just shy of Trump\u2019s second spot, even more significant is that late-breaking voters surged to him. Every poll suggested that a turnout surge like the one we saw would mean a massive Trump win, but Rubio was the real beneficiary.<br> <br> If the traditional GOP is consolidating around Rubio this soon, that means Trump will find himself unable to continue to make his case to the Washington establishment that he is a better bad choice than Cruz. Rather than forming his unlikely alliance between pitchfork populism and K Street dealmakers, Trump will have to fight a two-front war.</p>", "<p>In Rubio, Republicans are finding a candidate they can live with who also stacks up best against\u00a0<b>Hillary Clinton</b>. And Iowa just made him a very dangerous man for both Trump and Cruz.</p>", "<p><b>WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE\u2026<br> </b>While many were either preparing, or hearing endlessly about the massive snowstorm that hit the East Coast a few weeks ago one agency hunkered down.

The vast majority of cases -- 424,240 -- are immigrants who have either overstayed their permission to be here, or came into the country illegally. A smaller number involve criminal, terrorism or national security charges -- 25,561 as of September.\u00a0</p>", "<p>\u201cTo say you could just go and pick up 11 million or 12 million individuals and in just a couple of years deport them is just illogical, it\u2019s just not possible,\u201d said Maurice Goldman, an immigration lawyer in Tucson, Ariz., which has over 1,100 pending cases in its immigration court, according to <a href=\"http://trac.syr.edu/phptools/immigration/court_backlog/\" target=\"_blank\">TRAC (Transactional Records Clearinghouse)</a>, a project by Syracuse University that compiles up-to-date federal law enforcement records.\u00a0</p>", "<p>Most of the immigrants filling the courts today are Mexican -- 130,425 of the total -- followed by immigrants from El Salvador and Honduras.\u00a0</p>", "<p>The government is still deporting thousands -- according to the <a href=\"http://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/ois_enforcement_ar_2013.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">latest DHS data</a>, the government deported 438,000, 418,000 and 387,000 in 2013, 2012, and 2011 respectively -- but each case typically takes a long time to process.\u00a0</p>", "<p>Today, the average wait time for a case in the immigration court -- which can end in deportation -- is 643 days. In 2008, it was 438 days. Goldman, describing one of his own clients, a man who came to the U.S. illegally in 1992 and was brought before the court in 2010, said wait times can be much longer. It was five years before his client\u2019s case was \u201cadministratively closed,\u201d meaning he won\u2019t be deported this time but his charge is still \u201cpending.\u201d He can put back before a judge at any time.\u00a0</p>", "<p>The backlogs, too, have been steadily rising since 1998, the first year represented in the TRAC assessment. At that time, during the Clinton administration, there was a backlog of 129,505 cases. In 2008, a year before President Obama took the Oval Office from President George W. Bush, there was a backlog of 186,108.\u00a0</p>", "<p>Trump, though, has been resolute about not only building a U.S.-Mexico wall but the deportation plan. During the Nov. 10 presidential primary debate, Trump advocated mass deportations like those pursued by President Dwight Eisenhower, otherwise known as \u201cOperation Wetback,\u201d in 1954.\u00a0</p>", "<p>According to historians, hundreds of thousands of people were removed under that operation , including Mexican-American citizens, who were forcibly rounded up and sent over the border to Mexico. The months\u2019 long federal operation has been described as inhumane, and overall, ineffective in stopping the number of Mexicans coming over the border.\u00a0</p>", "<p>Still, Trump is defending his plan, telling Fox News he would do it humanely.\u00a0</p>", "<p>\"I've heard it both ways. I've heard good reports, I've heard bad reports,\" Trump told \"The O\u2019Reilly Factor\" on Wednesday about the mass deportations under Eisenhower. \"We would do it in a very humane way.\"\u00a0</p>", "<p>Speaking with Fox News' Bret Baier on Thursday, Trump dismissed the logistical concerns.\u00a0</p>", "<p>\"If we do this job right, there shouldn't be a big court situation. Nobody knows legal situations better than Trump,\" he said. \"They have to go back.\"\u00a0</p>", "<p>But critics say that while Trump could tweak federal regulations to streamline the process, he would have to change the law to pursue a strategy to avoid the immigration courts entirely. Currently, the government can fast-track deportations for violent criminals, but most immigrants, illegal and legal,<a href=\"http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/uploads/immigration/immig_west/E.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> have a constitutional right to due process as upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court</a>.\u00a0</p>", "<p>There\u2019s where the trouble lies in mass deportation. \u201cThere problem is, the immigration courts are so underfunded, and that is why there is such a terrible backlog,\u201d said Wendy Feliz, spokeswoman for the American Immigration Council. \u201c[Judge positions] go unfilled, and even if they were filled, they still wouldn\u2019t be sufficient.\u201d\u00a0</p>", "<p>Doug Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum, a fiscally conservative policy group that assessed the cost of mass deportation <a href=\"http://americanactionforum.org/research/the-budgetary-and-economic-costs-of-addressing-unauthorized-immigration-alt\" target=\"_blank\">in a study earlier this year</a>, told FoxNews.com that sending 11 million people home would \u201charm the economy in ways it would normally not be harmed.\u201d</p>", "<p>His group estimates it would cost upwards of $620 billion to apprehend, detain and deport every illegal immigrant. \u201cWe would need more courts, more detention facilities more police -- it would change the climate of America.\u201d</p>", "<p>\u201cI am 100 percent sympathetic with those who do not like illegal immigration,\u201d he said. \u201cBut what strategy you have for dealing with illegal immigrants is important. I\u2019m not a fan of this one.\u201d</p>"]}

As of Thursday, the Bakari-Bundy ad had more than 60,000 hits on YouTube.\u00a0</p>", "<p>While some last-minute ads are seen as a Hail Mary, others are meant to motivate a constituency in tight races, J.J. Balaban, a partner at The Campaign Group, told FoxNews.com.</p>", "<p>Balaban, who has helped create television and radio ads for campaigns in 34 states and 54 congressional districts, says it all comes down to how competitive a race is and where the ads run. For example, some candidates in smaller races don\u2019t have a ton of cash and so they rely on cheap web videos that have an amateurish feel and tend to be more outlandish than those paid for and aired on traditional media outlets.\u00a0</p>", "<p>\u201cWhat you\u2019ll see is that web videos get a lot of attention, but it\u2019s a mistake to treat them with the same weight [as paid TV ads],\u201d Balaban said, adding that most web videos are like a flash in the pan. The crazier they are, though, the more likely a reporter is going to spot it.</p>", "<p>\u201cThese ads succeed when reporters write about them, and you aren\u2019t going to write about them if they aren\u2019t off the wall or wacky,\u201d he said.</p>", "<p>Campaigns are still running plenty of paid TV ads. According to the Center for Public Integrity, a review of preliminary data shows that 908,000 television ads for Senate races will have aired through Monday. \u201cWith a week\u2019s worth of advertising yet to be tallied, to say nothing of the deluge of messaging that would flood anticipated Senate runoff contests in Georgia and Louisiana, the million-ad mark will be eclipsed soon,\u201d CPI states on its site.</p>"]}

The vast majority of cases -- 424,240 -- are immigrants who have either overstayed their permission to be here, or came into the country illegally. A smaller number involve criminal, terrorism or national security charges -- 25,561 as of September.\u00a0</p>", "<p>\u201cTo say you could just go and pick up 11 million or 12 million individuals and in just a couple of years deport them is just illogical, it\u2019s just not possible,\u201d said Maurice Goldman, an immigration lawyer in Tucson, Ariz., which has over 1,100 pending cases in its immigration court, according to <a href=\"http://trac.syr.edu/phptools/immigration/court_backlog/\" target=\"_blank\">TRAC (Transactional Records Clearinghouse)</a>, a project by Syracuse University that compiles up-to-date federal law enforcement records.\u00a0</p>", "<p>Most of the immigrants filling the courts today are Mexican -- 130,425 of the total -- followed by immigrants from El Salvador and Honduras.\u00a0</p>", "<p>The government is still deporting thousands -- according to the <a href=\"http://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/ois_enforcement_ar_2013.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">latest DHS data</a>, the government deported 438,000, 418,000 and 387,000 in 2013, 2012, and 2011 respectively -- but each case typically takes a long time to process.\u00a0</p>", "<p>Today, the average wait time for a case in the immigration court -- which can end in deportation -- is 643 days. In 2008, it was 438 days. Goldman, describing one of his own clients, a man who came to the U.S. illegally in 1992 and was brought before the court in 2010, said wait times can be much longer.

At that time, during the Clinton administration, there was a backlog of 129,505 cases. In 2008, a year before President Obama took the Oval Office from President George W. Bush, there was a backlog of 186,108.\u00a0</p>", "<p>Trump, though, has been resolute about not only building a U.S.-Mexico wall but the deportation plan.

I've heard good reports, I've heard bad reports,\" Trump told \"The O\u2019Reilly Factor\" on Wednesday about the mass deportations under Eisenhower. \"We would do it in a very humane way.\"\u00a0</p>", "<p>Speaking with Fox News' Bret Baier on Thursday, Trump dismissed the logistical concerns.\u00a0</p>", "<p>\"If we do this job right, there shouldn't be a big court situation. Nobody knows legal situations better than Trump,\" he said. \"They have to go back.\"\u00a0</p>", "<p>But critics say that while Trump could tweak federal regulations to streamline the process, he would have to change the law to pursue a strategy to avoid the immigration courts entirely. Currently, the government can fast-track deportations for violent criminals, but most immigrants, illegal and legal,<a href=\"http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/uploads/immigration/immig_west/E.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> have a constitutional right to due process as upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court</a>.\u00a0</p>", "<p>There\u2019s where the trouble lies in mass deportation. \u201cThere problem is, the immigration courts are so underfunded, and that is why there is such a terrible backlog,\u201d said Wendy Feliz, spokeswoman for the American Immigration Council. \u201c[Judge positions] go unfilled, and even if they were filled, they still wouldn\u2019t be sufficient.\u201d\u00a0</p>", "<p>Doug Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum, a fiscally conservative policy group that assessed the cost of mass deportation <a href=\"http://americanactionforum.org/research/the-budgetary-and-economic-costs-of-addressing-unauthorized-immigration-alt\" target=\"_blank\">in a study earlier this year</a>, told FoxNews.com that sending 11 million people home would \u201charm the economy in ways it would normally not be harmed.\u201d</p>", "<p>His group estimates it would cost upwards of $620 billion to apprehend, detain and deport every illegal immigrant. \u201cWe would need more courts, more detention facilities more police -- it would change the climate of America.\u201d</p>", "<p>\u201cI am 100 percent sympathetic with those who do not like illegal immigration,\u201d he said. \u201cBut what strategy you have for dealing with illegal immigrants is important.

They do not include groups that engage primarily in political activism or fundraising like PACs.</p>", "<p>As it stands, these nonprofits are required to send any contributor of $250 or more a \u201ccontemporaneous written acknowledgement (CWA)\u201d that includes the amount of the donation and any services or gifts received in return. This document is used by the donor when filing for deductions from their income taxes.</p>", "<p>The proposed rule would give nonprofits an alternative: instead of the traditional CWA, organizations could send the information for all individual donations, along with contributors\u2019 SSNs, directly to the IRS on a single form by Feb. 28 each year. A copy of what they send (with everyone else's information deleted) would be sent to the contributor. The idea is to make it easier for donors to document their donations for tax purposes since every contribution would be linked to their SSN. It could also, conceivably, cut down on paperwork for the nonprofit, which would only have to file one form for donors.</p>", "<p>Nonprofits aren\u2019t impressed. They say not only would it scare donors who don\u2019t want to give out their Social Security numbers, but it would require the nonprofits to get an added level of data security in order to protect contributors\u2019 personal information from hackers and identify theft. Then there is the third concern: that the IRS hasn\u2019t been the best steward of taxpayers\u2019 \u00a0private information in the past.</p>", "<p>\u201cThe IRS can\u2019t keep its information confidential, they\u2019ve been hacked,\u201d said Fitzgibbons. Last May, the IRS acknowledged that some 100,000 taxpayer SSNs and accompanying personal information <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/us/2015/05/27/irs-says-thieves-stole-tax-info-from-100000/\">had been accessed by thieves in a massive online grab</a>.</p>", "<p>Before that, during the 2012 elections, a leak of IRS donor information actually had political ramifications. The IRS recently<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2014/06/irs-nom-lawsuit-108266\" target=\"_blank\"> settled a lawsuit </a>brought by the National Organization for Marriage for $50,000 over allegations that a list of donors had been improperly released to the pro-gay rights Human Rights Campaign. The group then shared the data \u00a0with the media, which pounced on the revelation that then-presidential candidate Mitt Romney had donated to the group, which opposes same-sex marriage. The judge, however, said there was not enough evidence to prove the IRS willfully leaked the list.</p>", "<p>Now, donors may be wary of giving if they think their information might get into the wrong hands. Delaney, who formerly worked in the attorney general\u2019s office in Arizona, said in that job \"we were always advising people not to give away their Social Security numbers to anybody because it would be subject to identity theft.\" \u00a0</p>", "<p>\u201cScam artists, of which there are many, will start preying on people, the elderly. They\u2019ll say they can\u2019t take your tax deductible contribution unless you give them their Social Security number,\u201d he said.\u00a0</p>", "<p>According to the proposed rule, the requirement would be voluntary -- but critics are concerned this is merely \u201ca camel\u2019s nose in the tent\u201d and would eventually become mandatory if enacted.</p>", "<p>\u201cAny proposed regulations that would create this has the potential for being a slippery slope,\u201d said David Heinen, spokesman for the North Carolina Center for Nonprofits.</p>", "<p>The IRS has not responded to a request for comment from FoxNews.com.</p>", "<p>Even the notice on the Federal Register suggests identity theft isn\u2019t far from the authors' minds.</p>", "<p>It says: \u201cThe Treasury Department and the IRS are concerned about the potential risk for identity theft involved with donee reporting given that donees will be collecting donors' taxpayer identification numbers and maintaining those numbers for some period of time.\u201d</p>", "<p>The agencies want to hear more about how this can be mitigated in the public comment period, which ends Dec. 16.</p>", "<p>Meanwhile, Jenny Beth Martin, president of the Tea Party Patriots, which is listed as a public charity in the IRS database, said donors and nonprofits are still wary over <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/29/new-lerner-emails-show-irs-tried-to-cover-up-targeting-conservative-groups.html\">revelations that the IRS had unfairly scrutinized groups with political-sounding names and themes</a>.

The intelligence source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity citing the sensitivity of the ongoing probe, said the subsection requires the \"lawful possession\" of national defense information by a security clearance holder who \"through gross negligence,\" such as the use of an unsecure computer network, permits the material to be removed or abstracted from its proper, secure location.</p>", "<p>Subsection F also requires the clearance holder \"to make prompt report of such loss, theft, abstraction, or destruction to his superior officer. \"A failure to do so \"shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both.\"</p>", "<p>The source said investigators are also focused on possible obstruction of justice. \"If someone knows there is an ongoing investigation and takes action to impede an investigation, for example destruction of documents or threatening of witnesses, that could be a separate charge but still remain under a single case,\" the source said. Currently, the ongoing investigation is led by the Washington Field Office of the FBI.</p>", "<p>A former FBI agent, who is not involved in the case, said the inconsistent release of emails, with new documents coming to light from outside accounts, such as that of adviser Sidney Blumenthal, could constitute obstruction.

Drake, who also went to Congress with his concerns about the NSA, said his goal was to expose government misconduct.</p>", "<p>\"This is the secretary of state, one of the most targeted individuals by other intelligence entities and agencies in the world using a private server to traffic highly sensitive information and no doubt including classified information and no doubt including info about sources and methods,\"Drake said at Thursday\u2019s event.</p>", "<p>He added the whistleblowers\u2019 treatment shows there is a law for the average citizen, and apparently a different set of rules for the powerful.</p>", "<p>\"But hey, I'm secretary of state,\u201d Drake said in a sarcastic tone. \u201dEven Obama gave her cover.\"</p>", "<p>The charges against Drake were eventually dropped.

Mitch Holmes issued an 11-point code of conduct to guide women on how to dress. The Topeka Capital-Journal reported that Holmes\u2019 rules don\u2019t include any restrictions on men because, according to Holmes, men don\u2019t need instructions on how to look professional.</p>", "<p>\"Oh, for crying out loud, what century is this?\" Sen. Laura Kelly, a Topeka Democrat, said Thursday.</p>", "<p>Holmes, 53, is the chairman of the Senate Ethics and Elections Committee. He said he wrote the instruction because provocatively dressed women are a distraction. The guidelines don't detail a minimum skirt length or a permissible neckline for blouses.</p>", "<p>\"It's one of those things that's hard to define,\" Holmes said. \"Put it out there and let people know we're really looking for you to be addressing the issue rather than trying to distract or bring eyes to yourself.\"</p>", "<p>Holmes did think about adding a provision on how men should dress, but ultimately decided males didn\u2019t need any guidance. He expects lobbyists to understand the rules when interacting with his committee, although he acknowledged infrequent visitors to the Statehouse might be unaware.</p>", "<p>Female senators said no one should impose gender-specific demands on those testifying before committees.</p>", "<p>\"Who's going to define low-cut?\" said Sen. Vicki Schmidt, a Topeka Republican. \"Does it apply to senators?\"</p>", "<p>Sen. Carolyn McGinn, a Sedgwick Republican, said people who don't have clothes that meet Holmes' standards might be deterred from testifying.</p>", "<p>\"I am more interested in what they have to say about the direction our state should go than what they're wearing that day,\" McGinn said.</p>", "<p>State Sen. Oletha Faust-Goudeau, of Wichita, the ranking Democrat on the Senate\u2019s elections and ethics committee, said people testifying before committees ought to present themselves in a professional way but she was put off by the lack of consistency for men and women.</p>", "<p>\"In my 13 years in the Legislature, that's the first time I've ever read anything like that,\" Faust-Goudeau said. \"I thought it was a little strange.\"</p>", "<p>Senate President Susan Wagle, a Wichita Republican, predicted the committee will reconsider the dress code Wednesday at its next meeting. Wagle, who is a member of the committee but wasn't present when the rules were given to members, indicated she isn't inclined to intervene personally.</p>", "<p>\"The legislative process eventually always evolves to a consensus of the majority without leadership having to take action,\" she told The Associated Press.</p>", "<p>Senate Minority Leader Anthony Hensley, a Topeka Democrat, told the Associated Press that the \"irony\" of the dress code was that it came from a committee that \"should be more concerned about violations of campus finance law than what women wear.\"</p>", "<p>\"Coming from a man, I think it's important that women are supported in the choices that they make for themselves,\" he said.</p>", "<p>Kansas lawmakers had a previous controversy in 2014 over interns and how they were dressing.

The four emails originally were marked classified after a review by career officials at the State Department. But after a second review by the department's legal office, the designation was switched to \"B5\" -- also known as \"deliberative process,\" which refers to internal deliberations by the Executive Branch.\u00a0Such discussions are exempt from public release. \u00a0</p>", "<p>The B5 coding has the effect, according to a congressional source, of dropping the email content \"down a deep black hole.\"</p>", "<p>The four mails are separate and distinct from another group of emails identified by the Intelligence Community Inspector General as containing two messages with \"Top Secret\" \u00a0information.</p>", "<p>A congressional source told Fox that a July 23rd letter to Congress from the Inspector General for the Intelligence Community made passing reference to the incident in the recommendations \"...that State FOIA officials implement a dispute resolution process in regard to differences of opinion about classification levels and exemptions.

During Sunday night's debate, Clinton claimed Snyder didn\u2019t appear to care about the lead that has contaminated Flint\u2019s drinking water.</p>", "<p>\"We've had a city in the United States of America, where the population, which is poor in many ways, and majority African-American, has been drinking and bathing in lead-contaminated water,\" Clinton said. \"And the governor of that state acted as though he didn't really care. He had requests for help that he basically stonewalled.\"</p>", "<p>Sanders called on Snyder to simply resign.\u00a0</p>", "<p>Meanwhile, Flint Mayor Karen Weaver, a Democrat, visited the White House on Tuesday to address the issue.\u00a0</p>", "<p>And President Obama is expected to assign a \"tsar\" to oversee the crisis, Fox News has learned.</p>", "<p>Weaver is meeting with Valerie Jarrett, a top aide to the president, and purportedly will try to talk on Capitol Hill with Michigan's two senators, then get home in time for Snyder's state of the state address. \u00a0</p>", "<p>Snyder, who has faced similar accusations from liberal activists, responded by saying in a tweet that \u201cpolitical statements and finger pointing\u201d are not helping.\u00a0</p>", "<p>There is little question that the state bears significant responsibility for the public health crisis. Snyder apologized in December and Michigan's top environmental regulator, Dan Wyant, resigned after a task force created by Snyder blamed problems on his agency.\u00a0</p>", "<p>The group said the Department of Environmental Quality erred by not requiring Flint to keep corrosive water from leaching lead from service pipes into residents' homes and belittling concerns from the public. The city had switched from Detroit's water system to Flint River water in a cost-cutting move in 2014, while under state financial management.\u00a0</p>", "<p>Residents complained about the water's taste, smell and appearance, and children were found to have elevated levels of lead due to the water supply; lead exposure can cause behavior problems and learning disabilities in children.</p>", "<p>The city returned to Detroit water in October.</p>", "<p>However, the attacks on Snyder omit any mention of former Democratic Flint Mayor Dayne Walling or the federal Environmental Protection Agency.</p>", "<p>The EPA\u2019s top Midwest official <a href=\"http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2016/01/12/epa-stayed-silent-flints-tainted-water/78719620/\" target=\"_blank\">told\u00a0The Detroit News</a>\u00a0the agency knew about the lack of corrosion control in the water supply as early as April, after an EPA official identified problems with the drinking water, but did not make the information public.</p>", "<p>The paper also cited email exchanges between EPA officials and Walling showing what it described as a \u201clack of urgency\u201d over the matter and a greater focus on procedure rather than public safety. Walling and other officials repeatedly told residents the water was safe but blamed state and federal agencies for the problems.</p>", "<p>Walling was voted out in November, with the water issue cited as a reason for his loss. Neither Walling nor the EPA\u2019s alleged role in the crisis appeared in any criticisms from either Clinton or Sanders.\u00a0</p>", "<p>The EPA has not responded to a request for comment.\u00a0</p>", "<p>President Obama, meanwhile, designated Flint a federal emergency on Saturday but has refused Snyder\u2019s request to designate it a disaster zone as it is a man-made incident.</p>", "<p>Left-wing activist Michael Moore, who has famously advocated for his hometown of Flint in his documentaries, praised Clinton on Twitter for calling out Snyder.</p>", "<p>Moore later sent out a tweet calling Snyder a criminal.</p>", "<p>Moore isn\u2019t the only liberal activist to blast the situation as criminal.

Kentucky Democrats have been in disarray ever since, with the state party chairman resigning and party leaders yet to pick a replacement. But Gray gives Democrats a savvy political veteran who has shown a willingness to use his own money to fuel his campaigns. He used more than $800,000 of his own money in 2010 to topple an incumbent mayor, and gave himself another $250,000 in his 2014 re-election campaign.</p>", "<p>A self-funded candidate could compensate for the campaign's late start and help keep pace with Paul, who has a modest $1.4 million available in his Senate campaign account.</p>", "<p>Paul is the only major party presidential candidate who is running for two offices. Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida decided not to seek re-election to his Senate seat so he could focus on the presidential race. Paul ran into a legal problem in Kentucky, where a state law forbids candidates from appearing on the ballot twice in the same election. Kentucky Republicans decided to hold a presidential caucus on March 5 to get around that, with Paul donating $250,000 to cover the causes' expenses.</p>", "<p>Paul has dropped in presidential polling, so much that he was bumped from the main stage of the latest televised debate in Iowa. But he has managed to make most of the votes in the U.S. Senate while keeping a busy campaign schedule, saying that shows his commitment to his job.</p>"]}

Snyder apologized in December and Michigan's top environmental regulator, Dan Wyant, resigned after a task force created by Snyder blamed problems on his agency.\u00a0</p>", "<p>The group said the Department of Environmental Quality erred by not requiring Flint to keep corrosive water from leaching lead from service pipes into residents' homes and belittling concerns from the public.

The only way parents can get out of the mandate is if a physician says an exemption is warranted. The law, called the strictest in the country, applies to students attending any private or public school in California.

In other words, the drugs have been proven safe in preliminary clinical trials but have not yet received the final green light for market. Illinois will be the 15th state to pass such a law in the last two years.</p>", "<p>Starlee Coleman, a senior policy advisor at the Goldwater Institute, a major proponent of the Right to Try laws, says the measures are enjoying widespread support.</p>", "<p>\u201cIt\u00a0just shows that when it comes to common sense matters that help people there is really no partisan divide on giving sick people access to drugs that help them,\u201d she told FoxNews.com.</p>", "<p>Not if you are in California, though. Gov. Brown vetoed a similar bill that crossed his desk in October.</p>", "<p>Gun laws also have been among the top issues in states this year following a series of mass shootings -- including several on college campuses. Each jurisdiction is dealing with it differently, however. While some are making it easier for citizens to arm themselves, others are putting up barriers to carrying a weapon.</p>", "<p>In Texas, for example, citizens will be able to carry handguns in plain view in belt or shoulder holsters as of Jan. 1. The Lone Star state is now poised to be the 45th state to issue open carry permits. Currently, Texans who are licensed to carry in public must keep their guns hidden.</p>", "<p>Meanwhile, California passed a new law that would ban those with concealed carry permits from carrying their weapons on college or school campuses. No exceptions.</p>", "<p>Other notable laws this year include relaxed marijuana laws in Delaware. Possessing an ounce of the drug will be considered only a civil infraction, with a fine of $100, no greater than a traffic ticket. But a tough new measure in North Carolina might land graffiti artists in jail. As of Jan. 1, those convicted a third time for \u201cgraffiti vandalism,\u201d no matter how creative or where the graffiti is, will be handed a felony conviction and face jail time.</p>"]}

The man had been released from Mirkarimi's jail even though federal immigration officials had requested that he be detained.</p>", "<p>Also, Mirkarimi has endured a series of personal and official embarrassments, including having his driver's license briefly suspended and flunking a marksmanship test that prevents him from carrying a service weapon.</p>", "<p>\"I'm in the redemption industry,\" said Mirkarimi, 54, who launched the Green Party in California before changing his voter registration to Democrat. \"I believe in second chances.\"</p>", "<p>His opponent, retired sheriff's official Vicki Hennessy, 62, is running a low-key campaign \u2014 her first \u2014 hoping to capitalize on Mirkarimi's negative image.</p>", "<p>\"The department needs leadership,\" Hennessy said. \"It needs its credibility restored.\"</p>", "<p>The latest campaign contribution disclosures show that she has raised $286,000 to his $109,000 and won the endorsements of the unions representing the county jail's sworn officers.

Former Mayor Art Agnos also has endorsed Mirkarimi, who points to the success of the jail's high school and the dramatic reduction of the inmate population as major accomplishments.</p>", "<p>Hennessy said she was encouraged to enter the race by Mayor Ed Lee and others because of Mirkarimi's stumbles, which began when he bruised his wife's arm during a New Year's Eve argument in 2011.</p>", "<p>\"I never expected to run,\" said Hennessy, who joined the sheriff's department in 1975 and rose to chief deputy, the third-highest ranking position in the office. The San Francisco native retired five years ago after directing the city's emergency services agency.

The couple has a 6-year-old son.</p>", "<p>The pivotal issue in the race is the city's policy of shielding people in the country illegally from the reach of federal immigration officials. Mirkarimi's interpretation of the policy came under scrutiny following the March jail release of an inmate despite a federal immigration request to detain him for possible deportation. A few months later on July 2, the Mexican national is alleged to have shot to death Kate Steinle, 32, as she walked with her father along San Francisco's waterfront.</p>", "<p>Mirkarimi said city law prohibits the department from cooperating with federal immigration officials unless they have a warrant, a position criticized by presidential hopefuls Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton along with U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California and the mayor.</p>", "<p>Hennessy said the sheriff's order barring the San Francisco jail from cooperating with immigration officials is misguided. There are cases, she said, when federal immigration officials should be notified that the jail is about to release an inmate who is in the country illegally.</p>", "<p>But Hennessy said there are other problems with the department.</p>", "<p>Since the shooting of Steinle, Mirkarimi has had his driver's license briefly suspended for failing to properly report a minor accident while driving a department-issued car, and he flunked a marksmanship test.</p>", "<p>Before those two incidents, a drug gang leader escaped from jail, and guards were accused of staging and gambling on inmate fights.</p>", "<p>In November 2014, Mirkarimi apologized for the bungled search for a San Francisco General Hospital patient whose body was found in a stairwell weeks after she wandered from her room. The sheriff is in charge of the hospital's security, but deputies didn't search the building until nine days after her disappearance. The city paid the patient's family $3 million to settle a lawsuit.</p>", "<p>Political consultant Dan Newman and other analysts say the election is Hennessy's to lose because of Mirkarimi's problems.</p>", "<p>\"He imploded before he started,\" Newman said. \"Then he continued with a string of screw ups.\"</p>"]}

Those participating would, as part of their yearly report, turn over the Social Security numbers of any donors who give $250 or more to a charity in a given year.\u00a0</p>", "<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know any charity that would adopt this, but those who do will certainly be scaring their donors,\u201d said Mark Fitzgibbons, president of corporate affairs at American Target Advertising, which runs a number of conservative 501(c)(3) nonprofits.\u00a0</p>", "<p>The relationship between certain nonprofits and the IRS already suffers from trust issues in the wake of the controversy over officials subjecting conservative groups seeking another kind of nonprofit status to additional scrutiny.\u00a0</p>", "<p>The backlash over this rule, though, appears bipartisan and focused specifically on the security implications. \u00a0</p>", "<p>\u201cThis is a huge issue for nonprofits -- and the American public,\u201d said Tim Delaney, CEO of the National Council of Nonprofits, which opposes the rule.</p>", "<p>501(c)(3) organizations include charities, churches, universities \u2013 any group for which a donor can claim a deduction on their annual income taxes. They do not include groups that engage primarily in political activism or fundraising like PACs.</p>", "<p>As it stands, these nonprofits are required to send any contributor of $250 or more a \u201ccontemporaneous written acknowledgement (CWA)\u201d that includes the amount of the donation and any services or gifts received in return. This document is used by the donor when filing for deductions from their income taxes.</p>", "<p>The proposed rule would give nonprofits an alternative: instead of the traditional CWA, organizations could send the information for all individual donations, along with contributors\u2019 SSNs, directly to the IRS on a single form by Feb. 28 each year. A copy of what they send (with everyone else's information deleted) would be sent to the contributor. The idea is to make it easier for donors to document their donations for tax purposes since every contribution would be linked to their SSN. It could also, conceivably, cut down on paperwork for the nonprofit, which would only have to file one form for donors.</p>", "<p>Nonprofits aren\u2019t impressed. They say not only would it scare donors who don\u2019t want to give out their Social Security numbers, but it would require the nonprofits to get an added level of data security in order to protect contributors\u2019 personal information from hackers and identify theft. Then there is the third concern: that the IRS hasn\u2019t been the best steward of taxpayers\u2019 \u00a0private information in the past.</p>", "<p>\u201cThe IRS can\u2019t keep its information confidential, they\u2019ve been hacked,\u201d said Fitzgibbons. Last May, the IRS acknowledged that some 100,000 taxpayer SSNs and accompanying personal information <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/us/2015/05/27/irs-says-thieves-stole-tax-info-from-100000/\">had been accessed by thieves in a massive online grab</a>.</p>", "<p>Before that, during the 2012 elections, a leak of IRS donor information actually had political ramifications.

The group then shared the data \u00a0with the media, which pounced on the revelation that then-presidential candidate Mitt Romney had donated to the group, which opposes same-sex marriage. The judge, however, said there was not enough evidence to prove the IRS willfully leaked the list.</p>", "<p>Now, donors may be wary of giving if they think their information might get into the wrong hands. Delaney, who formerly worked in the attorney general\u2019s office in Arizona, said in that job \"we were always advising people not to give away their Social Security numbers to anybody because it would be subject to identity theft.\" \u00a0</p>", "<p>\u201cScam artists, of which there are many, will start preying on people, the elderly. They\u2019ll say they can\u2019t take your tax deductible contribution unless you give them their Social Security number,\u201d he said.\u00a0</p>", "<p>According to the proposed rule, the requirement would be voluntary -- but critics are concerned this is merely \u201ca camel\u2019s nose in the tent\u201d and would eventually become mandatory if enacted.</p>", "<p>\u201cAny proposed regulations that would create this has the potential for being a slippery slope,\u201d said David Heinen, spokesman for the North Carolina Center for Nonprofits.</p>", "<p>The IRS has not responded to a request for comment from FoxNews.com.</p>", "<p>Even the notice on the Federal Register suggests identity theft isn\u2019t far from the authors' minds.</p>", "<p>It says: \u201cThe Treasury Department and the IRS are concerned about the potential risk for identity theft involved with donee reporting given that donees will be collecting donors' taxpayer identification numbers and maintaining those numbers for some period of time.\u201d</p>", "<p>The agencies want to hear more about how this can be mitigated in the public comment period, which ends Dec. 16.</p>", "<p>Meanwhile, Jenny Beth Martin, president of the Tea Party Patriots, which is listed as a public charity in the IRS database, said donors and nonprofits are still wary over <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/07/29/new-lerner-emails-show-irs-tried-to-cover-up-targeting-conservative-groups.html\">revelations that the IRS had unfairly scrutinized groups with political-sounding names and themes</a>.

The White House also said it had appointed a Health and Human Services official to coordinate federal help provided to local responders and the state.</p>", "<p>\"Clearly, primary responsibility lies with state and local officials,\" White House spokesman Eric Schultz told reporters as Obama flew to Michigan. \"But that's not stopping this president and the administration from doing what they can.\"</p>", "<p>The crisis began in 2014 when a state-appointed emergency manager switched Flint from Detroit water to Flint River water to save money. The corrosive water caused lead to leach from old pipes. Flint returned to the Detroit system in October after elevated lead levels were discovered in children.</p>", "<p>Hillary Clinton brought more attention to the problem -- and its potential political ramifications -- when she declared during Sunday's presidential candidate debate that \"every single American should be outraged\" by the water crisis. She said that \"if the kids in a rich suburb of Detroit had been drinking contaminated water and being bathed in it, there would have been action.\"</p>", "<p>Although Obama had no plans for a detour to Flint while in the state, he met with Flint Mayor Karen Weaver when she visited Washington Tuesday. The White House said Obama heard about the challenges facing the city's residents and businesses and reiterated his administration's support for state and local officials in their response.</p>", "<p>As to the auto industry, the U.S. treasury invested about $80 billion in it during the last recession. After counting loan repayments, dividends and stock sales, the federal government recovered $70.5 billion.</p>", "<p>Obama can't take all of the credit for the government's help. President George W. Bush initiated the auto bailout with more than $17 billion in short-term loans. Under ordinary circumstances, Bush said he wouldn't have favored intervening to prevent auto makers from going out of business, but in the midst of a financial crisis and recession, allowing the industry to collapse would send the country into a deeper and longer recession.</p>", "<p>The Obama administration also provided additional capital to help Chrysler and G.M. continue operating as they restructured operations prior to and during a Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding. The companies shuttered plants, laid-off workers and cut ties with thousands of dealerships.</p>", "<p>Most Americans opposed providing a second round of government aid. A Gallup poll from February 2009 showed that about 58 percent opposed giving aid to automakers in danger of going bankrupt. Only about 41 percent supported the aid.</p>", "<p>Even three years later as Americans looked back, a slight majority said they disapproved of the bailout, with Republicans opposing it by a 3-to-1 margin, Gallup said.</p>", "<p>The auto show in Detroit is taking place as the industry enjoys record sales. Americans purchased nearly 17.5 million vehicles last year.</p>", "<p>Automakers use the show to unveil new products and technology. The show drew more than 200,000 visitors on its opening weekend for the public and manufacturers introduced 55 vehicles.</p>"]}

About 30 percent of the city is black, or roughly double the statewide average. Obama's campaign substantially increased black voter registration and turnout and cut the Republican margin of victory Bush saw here by tens of thousands of votes. John McCain won Duval by less than 8,000 in 2008 and Mitt Romney carried it by fewer than 15,000 in 2012.

I focus on making this about Jacksonville. People in Jacksonville don't care what's happening in Washington, they care what's happening in Jacksonville,\" Brown said.</p>", "<p>Curry wouldn't discuss the implication the race has on 2016, but he has no apologies for bringing in Republican heavy hitters.</p>", "<p>\"It's important for people in Jacksonville to know that I am a conservative Republican. I stand by conservative values -- fiscally responsible government, free enterprise solutions,\" he said. \"Asking for the support of those individuals was a statement to Jacksonville that this is who I am and I'm proud of it.\"</p>", "<p>The race is considered too close to call and has been nasty. Curry, an accountant, is using a report that found more than $500 million in accounting errors to blame Brown for being fiscally irresponsible, though the report found the errors began long before Brown took office. Curry also blamed Brown for rising crime.</p>", "<p>\"We should all be angry, we should all be upset, we should all be mourning,\" Curry told a small group of business owners. \"We had lost the distinction of the murder capital in the state of Florida. Our violent crime has now spiked over the last three years, the murder rate is now back up.\"</p>", "<p>Brown says Curry is a hyper-partisan who won't govern in the best interests of all city residents. He's accused Curry of trying to suppress the black vote when he was the state GOP chairman, pointing at cuts in early voting days and other changes ahead of the 2012 presidential election that critics said made it more difficult for minorities to vote.</p>", "<p>In flyers being hung on doorknobs, Brown's campaign calls Curry, \"Divisive and dangerous.\" It led Curry to ask Brown during a televised debate, \"Do you think I'm a racist?\"</p>", "<p>\"He did everything he could to suppress our citizens' right to vote by taking away early voting. Why would he do that?\" Brown said the next day. \"He spent his entire adult life being divisive and dividing people instead of uniting them. I spent four years uniting this city.\"</p>", "<p>Brown chose a bakery near downtown for an interview with The Associated Press to symbolize a city economy that's improving. When he took office, the area stood vacant. It now has stores, restaurants and new urban apartments.</p>", "<p>\"Downtown is on fire. It's thriving.

The man had been released from Mirkarimi's jail even though federal immigration officials had requested that he be detained.</p>", "<p>Also, Mirkarimi has endured a series of personal and official embarrassments, including having his driver's license briefly suspended and flunking a marksmanship test that prevents him from carrying a service weapon.</p>", "<p>\"I'm in the redemption industry,\" said Mirkarimi, 54, who launched the Green Party in California before changing his voter registration to Democrat. \"I believe in second chances.\"</p>", "<p>His opponent, retired sheriff's official Vicki Hennessy, 62, is running a low-key campaign \u2014 her first \u2014 hoping to capitalize on Mirkarimi's negative image.</p>", "<p>\"The department needs leadership,\" Hennessy said. \"It needs its credibility restored.\"</p>", "<p>The latest campaign contribution disclosures show that she has raised $286,000 to his $109,000 and won the endorsements of the unions representing the county jail's sworn officers. Hennessy is also supported by the mayor.</p>", "<p>Mirkarimi, who served for eight years on the city's Board of Supervisors, has won the endorsement of the previous sheriff, who served for 32 years before retiring in 2011. Former Mayor Art Agnos also has endorsed Mirkarimi, who points to the success of the jail's high school and the dramatic reduction of the inmate population as major accomplishments.</p>", "<p>Hennessy said she was encouraged to enter the race by Mayor Ed Lee and others because of Mirkarimi's stumbles, which began when he bruised his wife's arm during a New Year's Eve argument in 2011.</p>", "<p>\"I never expected to run,\" said Hennessy, who joined the sheriff's department in 1975 and rose to chief deputy, the third-highest ranking position in the office. The San Francisco native retired five years ago after directing the city's emergency services agency.

The couple has a 6-year-old son.</p>", "<p>The pivotal issue in the race is the city's policy of shielding people in the country illegally from the reach of federal immigration officials. Mirkarimi's interpretation of the policy came under scrutiny following the March jail release of an inmate despite a federal immigration request to detain him for possible deportation. A few months later on July 2, the Mexican national is alleged to have shot to death Kate Steinle, 32, as she walked with her father along San Francisco's waterfront.</p>", "<p>Mirkarimi said city law prohibits the department from cooperating with federal immigration officials unless they have a warrant, a position criticized by presidential hopefuls Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton along with U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California and the mayor.</p>", "<p>Hennessy said the sheriff's order barring the San Francisco jail from cooperating with immigration officials is misguided. There are cases, she said, when federal immigration officials should be notified that the jail is about to release an inmate who is in the country illegally.</p>", "<p>But Hennessy said there are other problems with the department.</p>", "<p>Since the shooting of Steinle, Mirkarimi has had his driver's license briefly suspended for failing to properly report a minor accident while driving a department-issued car, and he flunked a marksmanship test.</p>", "<p>Before those two incidents, a drug gang leader escaped from jail, and guards were accused of staging and gambling on inmate fights.</p>", "<p>In November 2014, Mirkarimi apologized for the bungled search for a San Francisco General Hospital patient whose body was found in a stairwell weeks after she wandered from her room. The sheriff is in charge of the hospital's security, but deputies didn't search the building until nine days after her disappearance. The city paid the patient's family $3 million to settle a lawsuit.</p>", "<p>Political consultant Dan Newman and other analysts say the election is Hennessy's to lose because of Mirkarimi's problems.</p>", "<p>\"He imploded before he started,\" Newman said. \"Then he continued with a string of screw ups.\"</p>"]}

Ben Chipman, hopes to punish the Republican governor for allegedly using his influence to pressure a school operator into rescinding a job offer from Democratic House Speaker Mark Eves. Eves responded to the action by filing a civil lawsuit in federal court.</p>", "<p>\"It's a matter of principle,\" said Chipman, of Portland. \"It's about holding the governor accountable and standing up to his behavior.\"</p>", "<p>LePage critics are also seeking to look into allegations that he forced out the president of the Maine Community College System, refused to allow administration officials to testify in front of committees and involved himself in the internal workings of the unemployment compensation board.</p>", "<p>LePage was initially elected as Maine\u2019s governor in 2010 and was re-elected in 2014.

However, some Democrats fear the decision to go ahead with a vote on the proposed order will prove futile and could embolden the already outspoken governor.</p>", "<p>The state attorney general, Democrat Janet Mills, has already declined to investigate LePage's conduct. She said there was no evidence he committed a crime when he pressured Good Will-Hinckley, an organization that serves at-risk young people, to rescind the job offer to Eves.</p>", "<p>LePage is known for a blunt style and off-the-cuff remarks that get him into trouble.\u00a0</p>", "<p>He was criticized last week after saying out-of-state drug dealers with names like \"D-Money, Smoothie and Shifty\" sell heroin in Maine and \"half the time they impregnate a young white girl before they leave.\" He later apologized for the comment, calling it a slip of the tongue.</p>", "<p>Rep.

LePage also once told the Portland NAACP to \"kiss my butt.\" He said a political opponent gives it to the people \"without providing Vaseline.\"</p>", "<p>Republican Rep. Kenneth Fredette, of Newport, defended LePage\u2019s comments, telling The Boston Globe the governor may have mistakenly chosen his words because his first language is French.</p>", "<p>An impeachment order would be unprecedented. It also wouldn't likely survive long as it would eventually go to the Republican-controlled Senate.</p>", "<p>The Boston Globe reported that an investigative panel would have until April 1 to report any findings and recommend an impeachment.

The White House also said it had appointed a Health and Human Services official to coordinate federal help provided to local responders and the state.</p>", "<p>\"Clearly, primary responsibility lies with state and local officials,\" White House spokesman Eric Schultz told reporters as Obama flew to Michigan. \"But that's not stopping this president and the administration from doing what they can.\"</p>", "<p>The crisis began in 2014 when a state-appointed emergency manager switched Flint from Detroit water to Flint River water to save money. The corrosive water caused lead to leach from old pipes. Flint returned to the Detroit system in October after elevated lead levels were discovered in children.</p>", "<p>Hillary Clinton brought more attention to the problem -- and its potential political ramifications -- when she declared during Sunday's presidential candidate debate that \"every single American should be outraged\" by the water crisis. She said that \"if the kids in a rich suburb of Detroit had been drinking contaminated water and being bathed in it, there would have been action.\"</p>", "<p>Although Obama had no plans for a detour to Flint while in the state, he met with Flint Mayor Karen Weaver when she visited Washington Tuesday.

After counting loan repayments, dividends and stock sales, the federal government recovered $70.5 billion.</p>", "<p>Obama can't take all of the credit for the government's help. President George W. Bush initiated the auto bailout with more than $17 billion in short-term loans. Under ordinary circumstances, Bush said he wouldn't have favored intervening to prevent auto makers from going out of business, but in the midst of a financial crisis and recession, allowing the industry to collapse would send the country into a deeper and longer recession.</p>", "<p>The Obama administration also provided additional capital to help Chrysler and G.M. continue operating as they restructured operations prior to and during a Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding. The companies shuttered plants, laid-off workers and cut ties with thousands of dealerships.</p>", "<p>Most Americans opposed providing a second round of government aid. A Gallup poll from February 2009 showed that about 58 percent opposed giving aid to automakers in danger of going bankrupt. Only about 41 percent supported the aid.</p>", "<p>Even three years later as Americans looked back, a slight majority said they disapproved of the bailout, with Republicans opposing it by a 3-to-1 margin, Gallup said.</p>", "<p>The auto show in Detroit is taking place as the industry enjoys record sales. Americans purchased nearly 17.5 million vehicles last year.</p>", "<p>Automakers use the show to unveil new products and technology.

James Inhofe, R-Okla., and Ben Sasse, R-Neb., asked the DOJ to investigate whether the EPA \u201cknowingly and willfully violated\u201d federal law as part of its Clean Water Rule in 2015.</p>", "<p>\u201cOnly a thorough and independent investigation can determine whether a crime has occurred,\u201d the senators wrote to Lynch in a letter dated last Thursday, noting the penalty for breaking the law in question runs up to a $5,000 fine and two years in prison.</p>", "<p>In December, the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office concluded that EPA social media campaigns on the water rules violated the law -- by spending money on grassroots lobbying, and in a way not authorized by Congress.</p>", "<p>But the senators, in their letter, suggested the EPA is doing little about it.\u00a0</p>", "<p>\u201cDespite the fact that the Government Accountability Office found that they broke federal law by running a covert propaganda campaign to support their sweeping WOTUS (Waters of the United States) rule, the EPA has doubled down on their lawlessness,\u201d Sasse said in a written statement. \u201cIt\u2019s time for the Department of Justice to investigate.\u201d</p>", "<p>The lawmakers claim the EPA continues to violate the law in question -- the Antideficiency Act, which prohibits officials from spending money not approved by Congress -- and that \u201conly a thorough and independent investigation can determine whether a crime has occurred.\u201d\u00a0</p>", "<p>The GAO report in December had criticized the EPA for using social media to push the new water regulations.

Obama and Ryan planned a private lunch following a joint meeting with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, whose focus this year is largely on protecting vulnerable Republicans and keeping the Senate in GOP hands come November.</p>", "<p>Ahead of the meeting, Ryan told reporters that he was excited to see the start of voting in Iowa's presidential caucuses Monday night because \"what it tells me is the days of Barack Obama's presidency are numbered.\"</p>", "<p>White House spokesman Josh Earnest, trying to frame such a comment in a positive light, said that if the fact that Obama only has year in office left makes it easier for Republicans to work with him, \"then maybe we should hold the Iowa caucus every day.\"</p>", "<p>As Ryan swept into the speakership in October, the White House was cautiously optimistic that the policy-minded Republican, given a powerful mandate by his unruly caucus, might be able to work with Obama in 2016 on a narrow set of issues with some bipartisan overlap. Although Obama has scaled back his legislative ambitions from the sweeping proposals he pushed earlier in his presidency, he still needs Congress to help finish what he's started in certain areas -- trade being chief among them.</p>", "<p>But with campaign season in full bloom, enticing Republicans to work with Obama on much of anything is becoming an increasingly arduous task, especially as many lawmakers facing competitive primaries seek to avoid votes that conservative challengers could use against them. Just as Ryan and McConnell were heading to the White House, the Republicans and Democrats running to replace Obama were shuttling from Iowa to New Hampshire for the next step in a presidential primary that's now the dominant force in the political conversation.</p>", "<p>Ryan, speaking after the weekly GOP caucus, said he and Obama get along personally, but have their policy differences. He said he hoped they could \"put those disagreements in check and see where the common ground is.\"</p>", "<p>Earnest said the president spent time during the meeting laying out five areas where he's hopeful the White House can work with the GOP-controlled Congress this year, including Puerto Rico's financial crisis, the Trans-Pacific free-trade deal, fighting opioid abuse, pursuing cures for cancer and criminal justice reform. Earnest said those topics are being brought up by GOP presidential candidates on the campaign trail, so they should be areas for bipartisan cooperation.</p>", "<p>Heading into Obama's final year, perhaps no issue seemed riper for compromise than a criminal justice overhaul that both parties agree is sorely needed. In an early sign of progress, a Senate panel approved legislation easing strict sentencing requirements for some nonviolent offenders.</p>", "<p>But McConnell has been moving cautiously without committing to a vote while the bill's GOP backers downplay prospects for a breakthrough this year. Ryan's deputy, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, on Monday became the latest Republican to warn that it might need to wait until next year, when Obama steps aside.</p>", "<p>Obama is seeking final congressional approval for the sweeping free-trade deal with Asia, which most Republicans support and most Democrats oppose. To Obama's dismay, many GOP leaders have suggested they might not vote until after November's election, leaving the fate of a major pillar in Obama's economic legacy to the unpredictable lame-duck period.</p>", "<p>Republican leadership aides listed a number of other likely topics, including North Korea sanctions, energy legislation, Vice President Joe Biden's cancer initiative and the Guantanamo Bay prison that Obama has been trying to close over GOP opposition. Obama's call for a new war authorization was another focus, though Republicans and Obama disagree sharply about what limitations should be included, dimming prospects for a bill this year.</p>", "<p>In a sign of GOP eagerness to move past Obama, Ryan will return from lunch Obama for a House vote on overriding Obama's veto of a bill gutting his signature health care law.</p>"]}

While the district\u2019s elementary and middle schools remain in the program, which sets portion and nutrition guidelines for students, provides low cost staples and subsidizes meals of low-income pupils, it proved immensely unpopular at the high school.</p>", "<p>\u201cWe saw the [federally-mandated] food going right into the garbage,\u201d said Greenberg. \u201cWe had some of the healthiest trash cans in the state of New Hampshire.\u201d</p>", "<p>Before the current school year began in the town of 24,000 neighboring Manchester, the district decided to pull the older students out of the program. Doing so gave officials flexibility in what meals they offered and how they were prepared. The high school now has a new snack room, a coffee bar and a frozen-yogurt machine, and a salad bar is set to open next month. Participation in the school lunch program rose from 29 percent to 33 percent, according to officials.</p>", "<p>Greenberg\u2019s goal was not to provide a less healthy menu, but to provide more choices and ensure the food was actually consumed.</p>", "<p>\u201cWe knew full well that in doing so, we would have to pick up the tab for the [high school] kids who got free and reduced-price lunches,\u201d Greenberg said. \u201cWe were okay with that.</p>", "<p>\u201cWe were able to offer nutritious lunches with greater variety,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe have seen greater participation and enthusiasm, as well as significantly less waste.\u201d</p>", "<p>But the problem arose when U.S. Department of Agriculture officials, and the state agency that shares oversight of the program, realized that nearly all of the district\u2019s food is taken in, stored and prepared at the facility at the high school. That means food destined for the one middle and four elementary schools, which is subsidized by taxpayers, could be co-mingled with food that is not. It also means the high school \u2013 but not the other schools in the district \u2013 would forgo foods the USDA provides at low prices, including cheese, diced chicken and peaches.</p>", "<p>To ensure that all food was properly accounted for, the district could either build a separate facility for food preparation at the other schools or adopt the type of strict accounting system used at industrial food processing facilities, where every item is monitored coming in and going out. It would also have to submit to rigorous and regular federal inspections, according to Greenberg.</p>", "<p>\u201cSay we are making meat loaf,\u201d Greenberg said. \u201cSomeone drops a pound of ground beef on the floor. Normally, we would simply throw that away. But now, we would have to log it, and document whether it came out of the high school\u2019s supplies or the elementary school\u2019s.</p>", "<p>\u201cWe would have to do that with everything, coming in and going out,\u201d he added. \u201cThey are treating us like we are Tyson Chicken.\u201d</p>", "<p>Greenberg said the district provided what he considered a reasonable bookkeeping plan that seemed to pass muster with the USDA regional office in Boston, but recently received a letter from the state office that oversees distribution of federal surplus food under the lunch program that directly cited USDA officials saying the plan could not be approved, and that the district's unique situation would require accounting \"similar to what we'd require of a processor.\"</p>", "<p>USDA spokeswoman Brooke Hardison said the Londonderry situation was unique because participating and non-participating schools share the same storage and preparation facilities, but said it was the state office, not the federal agency, that rejected the plan.</p>", "<p>\u201cIn this unique situation, the state distributing agency, which is responsible for oversight and monitoring of the use and storage of USDA foods it receives, reached out to USDA for guidance as the state works to ensure that these taxpayer-funded resources are used properly within the school district\u2019s school lunch program,\u201d she said.</p>", "<p>\u201cUSDA is not imposing any additional regulations or special requirements on the state of New Hampshire or the Londonderry High School, as a result of the high school\u2019s decision to exit the National School Lunch Program.\u00a0 There is no USDA regulation that requires non-participating schools to be classified as processing facilities.\"</p>", "<p>Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., blasted the government agency for imposing \u201cburdensome\u201d costs on the local school district, and on Thursday fired off a letter to Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, urging the agency to grant Londonderry a waiver from the regulations.</p>", "<p>\u201cLocal school districts in New Hampshire that are working to both ensure proper nutrition for their students and responsibly manage taxpayer dollars should not be burdened by onerous federal requirements from Washington,\u201d Ayotte said in a statement.</p>", "<p>Rep. Frank Guinta, a Republican and one of the state\u2019s two members of Congress, said if the lunch program satisfies students, parents and local taxpayers, the federal government should butt out.</p>", "<p>\u201cUnfortunately for New Hampshire, the USDA is providing a great example for the rest of the country of what's wrong in Washington,\u201d Guinta said. \u201cFederal bureaucrats write rules that don't work and punish us when we produce alternatives. In this case, it's clear they care less about nutrition than they do about control.\u201d</p>", "<p>A USDA official said it is up to state officials to ensure compliance with the lunch program, but that state officials had reached out to the USDA regional office for guidance because of the unusual situation. But the official said it is not up to the USDA to grant a waiver and that state and federal regulators plan to meet later this month to work out a monitoring and compliance plan for Londonderry.</p>", "<p>Meanwhile, even without the new red tape the district has already paid a price by forgoing the subsidies for low income high school kids\u2019 meals. By some estimates, that alone has more than doubled the cost of each meal. Greenberg said the district never intended to wade into the politics of the school lunch program, which has been championed by First Lady Michelle Obama, yet proven extremely unpopular with older students. But he is now left wondering if the bureaucratic pushback is agenda-driven.</p>", "<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2018s the intent, but you could perceive it that way,\u201d he said. \u201cOur issue is quality lunches, healthy lunches and choice vs. healthy trash cans.\u201d</p>"]}

Security Council action that would impose \"significant new measures\" to punish Pyongyang for its latest test earlier this month and boost pressure on it to return to disarmament talks.</p>", "<p>\"There's been a lot of talk about North Korea through these past years. Now we believe is the time for action that can bring North Korea back to the table,\" Kerry said.</p>", "<p>Wang said China agreed on the need for a new resolution, but suggested that Beijing would not support new sanctions. \"Sanctions are not an end in themselves,\" he said.</p>", "<p>\"The new resolution should not provoke new tension in the situation, still less destabilize the Korean peninsula,\" Wang said.</p>", "<p>China is North Korea's most important ally, chief trading partner and a key source of economic assistance. While it condemned the latest test, Beijing has balked at imposing harsh sanctions that could destabilize the hard-line communist regime.</p>", "<p>Kerry noted that sanctions had brought Iran to the nuclear negotiating table. \"With all due respect,\" he said. \"More significant and impactful sanctions were put in place against Iran, which did not have a nuclear weapon than against North Korea, which does.\"</p>", "<p>\"All nations, particularly those who seek a global leadership role, or have a global leadership role, have a responsibility to deal with this threat,\" he said, referring to China.</p>", "<p>Kerry said the sides agreed both on the need for a strong new resolution on North Korea, but also to accelerate talks on what that would entail.</p>", "<p>\"It's good to agree on the goal. But it's not enough to agree on the goal, we believe we need to agree on the meaningful steps necessary to get to the achievement of the goal to the negotiations that result in denuclearization,\" Kerry said.</p>", "<p>For his part, Wang also took umbrage at U.S. complaints that China is not doing as much as it can with the leverage it has on North Korea to stop the destabilizing behavior. He noted that China's position has been consistent in opposing North Korea's nuclear weapons program and supporting a diplomatic resolution to the matter.</p>", "<p>\"For many years China has been working hard to implement these,\" he said. \"We have delivered on our obligation.\"</p>", "<p>Wang said China's position is \"clear cut\" and \"responsible.\"</p>", "<p>\"Our position will not be swayed by specific events or the temporary mood of the moment,\" he said. \"We reject all groundless speculation or distortion of China's position.\"</p>", "<p>Kerry, though, pressed ahead, saying that China is North Korea's main link to the outside world, and that it could do more to limit cross-border transactions that benefit North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and his government.</p>", "<p>Kim Jong Un's actions in testing the latest device was \"reckless and dangerous,\" Kerry said, vowing that the U.S. would take whatever steps it needed to protect itself and its allies.</p>", "<p>Kerry, who after meeting with Wang was set to see State Councilor Yang Jiechi and President Xi Jinping, also called on China to halt land reclamation and construction of airstrips in disputed areas of the South China Sea, steps that have alarmed its smaller neighbors.</p>", "<p>\"I stressed the importance of finding common ground among the claimants and avoiding the destabilizing cycle of mistrust or escalation,\" Kerry said.</p>", "<p>Wang, though denied that China has was doing anything other than protecting its territorial sovereignty. And, he rejected accusations from the United States and others that China was not interested in peaceful resolutions to the disputes or militarizing the areas. \"We cannot accept the allegation that China's words are not being matched by actions.\"</p>", "<p>Kerry arrived in China from stops in Laos and Cambodia, where he called on the two members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to present a united front in dealing with increasing Chinese assertiveness over the South China Sea claims. His visits to Vientiane and Phnom Penh come ahead of a summit with the leaders of all 10 ASEAN nations that President Barack Obama will host next month in California.</p>", "<p>China, which claims sovereignty of much of the territory in the South China Sea, rejects claims from countries like the Philippines and Vietnam and has bristled at U.S. warnings that its activities threaten the freedom of navigation in some of the world's busiest commercial shipping lanes. Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei also have overlapping claims in the strategically vital sea, through which around $5 trillion in world trade passes each year.</p>", "<p>The U.S. says it takes no position on the claims but says developments in the South China Sea are a national security interest. It has urged that the disputes be settled peacefully and that a binding code of conduct be established for the area.</p>", "<p>Tensions have been especially high since Beijing transformed seven disputed reefs into islands, where it is now constructing runways and facilities that rival claimants say can be used militarily. China has said it built the islands primarily to foster safe civilian sea travel and fishing.</p>", "<p>In response, the U.S. sent a guided-missile destroyer close to one of the Chinese-built islands, called Subi Reef, in October in a challenge to Beijing's territorial claims, sparking warnings from China. U.S. officials vowed to continue maneuvers to protect freedom of navigation and overflight.</p>", "<p>Recent developments, including China's movement of an oil rig into a zone disputed with Vietnam and warnings against Philippines overflight of what it claims to be its territory, have raised those levels of concern. China dismisses the warnings as unwarranted, but has harshly criticized a U.S.-Philippines defense pact that allows American forces, warships and planes to be based temporarily in local military camps. China says that will \"escalate tensions and undermine peace and stability in the region,\" echoing language the United States uses to criticize China's actions.</p>"]}

Obama and Ryan planned a private lunch following a joint meeting with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, whose focus this year is largely on protecting vulnerable Republicans and keeping the Senate in GOP hands come November.</p>", "<p>Ahead of the meeting, Ryan told reporters that he was excited to see the start of voting in Iowa's presidential caucuses Monday night because \"what it tells me is the days of Barack Obama's presidency are numbered.\"</p>", "<p>White House spokesman Josh Earnest, trying to frame such a comment in a positive light, said that if the fact that Obama only has year in office left makes it easier for Republicans to work with him, \"then maybe we should hold the Iowa caucus every day.\"</p>", "<p>As Ryan swept into the speakership in October, the White House was cautiously optimistic that the policy-minded Republican, given a powerful mandate by his unruly caucus, might be able to work with Obama in 2016 on a narrow set of issues with some bipartisan overlap. Although Obama has scaled back his legislative ambitions from the sweeping proposals he pushed earlier in his presidency, he still needs Congress to help finish what he's started in certain areas -- trade being chief among them.</p>", "<p>But with campaign season in full bloom, enticing Republicans to work with Obama on much of anything is becoming an increasingly arduous task, especially as many lawmakers facing competitive primaries seek to avoid votes that conservative challengers could use against them. Just as Ryan and McConnell were heading to the White House, the Republicans and Democrats running to replace Obama were shuttling from Iowa to New Hampshire for the next step in a presidential primary that's now the dominant force in the political conversation.</p>", "<p>Ryan, speaking after the weekly GOP caucus, said he and Obama get along personally, but have their policy differences. He said he hoped they could \"put those disagreements in check and see where the common ground is.\"</p>", "<p>Earnest said the president spent time during the meeting laying out five areas where he's hopeful the White House can work with the GOP-controlled Congress this year, including Puerto Rico's financial crisis, the Trans-Pacific free-trade deal, fighting opioid abuse, pursuing cures for cancer and criminal justice reform. Earnest said those topics are being brought up by GOP presidential candidates on the campaign trail, so they should be areas for bipartisan cooperation.</p>", "<p>Heading into Obama's final year, perhaps no issue seemed riper for compromise than a criminal justice overhaul that both parties agree is sorely needed. In an early sign of progress, a Senate panel approved legislation easing strict sentencing requirements for some nonviolent offenders.</p>", "<p>But McConnell has been moving cautiously without committing to a vote while the bill's GOP backers downplay prospects for a breakthrough this year. Ryan's deputy, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, on Monday became the latest Republican to warn that it might need to wait until next year, when Obama steps aside.</p>", "<p>Obama is seeking final congressional approval for the sweeping free-trade deal with Asia, which most Republicans support and most Democrats oppose. To Obama's dismay, many GOP leaders have suggested they might not vote until after November's election, leaving the fate of a major pillar in Obama's economic legacy to the unpredictable lame-duck period.</p>", "<p>Republican leadership aides listed a number of other likely topics, including North Korea sanctions, energy legislation, Vice President Joe Biden's cancer initiative and the Guantanamo Bay prison that Obama has been trying to close over GOP opposition. Obama's call for a new war authorization was another focus, though Republicans and Obama disagree sharply about what limitations should be included, dimming prospects for a bill this year.</p>", "<p>In a sign of GOP eagerness to move past Obama, Ryan will return from lunch Obama for a House vote on overriding Obama's veto of a bill gutting his signature health care law.</p>"]}

In October 2014, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) <a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/assets/670/666566.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> that federal agencies spent $3.1 billion from fiscal 2011-2013 on salaries for employees on administrative leave.\u00a0</p>", "<p>Because no uniform policy is set in law or regulation, agencies have functioned with broad discretion in setting and enforcing administrative policy for the last 50 years. This has contributed to what the Iowa senator describes as a \"Wild West environment among agencies on paid administrative leave.\"\u00a0</p>", "<p>Following the GAO report, Grassley and then-House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform Chairman Darrell Issa sent letters to 17 agencies and one agency inspector general seeking a full accounting of why individuals were placed on leave.

While the district\u2019s elementary and middle schools remain in the program, which sets portion and nutrition guidelines for students, provides low cost staples and subsidizes meals of low-income pupils, it proved immensely unpopular at the high school.</p>", "<p>\u201cWe saw the [federally-mandated] food going right into the garbage,\u201d said Greenberg. \u201cWe had some of the healthiest trash cans in the state of New Hampshire.\u201d</p>", "<p>Before the current school year began in the town of 24,000 neighboring Manchester, the district decided to pull the older students out of the program. Doing so gave officials flexibility in what meals they offered and how they were prepared. The high school now has a new snack room, a coffee bar and a frozen-yogurt machine, and a salad bar is set to open next month. Participation in the school lunch program rose from 29 percent to 33 percent, according to officials.</p>", "<p>Greenberg\u2019s goal was not to provide a less healthy menu, but to provide more choices and ensure the food was actually consumed.</p>", "<p>\u201cWe knew full well that in doing so, we would have to pick up the tab for the [high school] kids who got free and reduced-price lunches,\u201d Greenberg said. \u201cWe were okay with that.</p>", "<p>\u201cWe were able to offer nutritious lunches with greater variety,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe have seen greater participation and enthusiasm, as well as significantly less waste.\u201d</p>", "<p>But the problem arose when U.S. Department of Agriculture officials, and the state agency that shares oversight of the program, realized that nearly all of the district\u2019s food is taken in, stored and prepared at the facility at the high school. That means food destined for the one middle and four elementary schools, which is subsidized by taxpayers, could be co-mingled with food that is not. It also means the high school \u2013 but not the other schools in the district \u2013 would forgo foods the USDA provides at low prices, including cheese, diced chicken and peaches.</p>", "<p>To ensure that all food was properly accounted for, the district could either build a separate facility for food preparation at the other schools or adopt the type of strict accounting system used at industrial food processing facilities, where every item is monitored coming in and going out. It would also have to submit to rigorous and regular federal inspections, according to Greenberg.</p>", "<p>\u201cSay we are making meat loaf,\u201d Greenberg said. \u201cSomeone drops a pound of ground beef on the floor. Normally, we would simply throw that away. But now, we would have to log it, and document whether it came out of the high school\u2019s supplies or the elementary school\u2019s.</p>", "<p>\u201cWe would have to do that with everything, coming in and going out,\u201d he added. \u201cThey are treating us like we are Tyson Chicken.\u201d</p>", "<p>Greenberg said the district provided what he considered a reasonable bookkeeping plan that seemed to pass muster with the USDA regional office in Boston, but recently received a letter from the state office that oversees distribution of federal surplus food under the lunch program that directly cited USDA officials saying the plan could not be approved, and that the district's unique situation would require accounting \"similar to what we'd require of a processor.\"</p>", "<p>USDA spokeswoman Brooke Hardison said the Londonderry situation was unique because participating and non-participating schools share the same storage and preparation facilities, but said it was the state office, not the federal agency, that rejected the plan.</p>", "<p>\u201cIn this unique situation, the state distributing agency, which is responsible for oversight and monitoring of the use and storage of USDA foods it receives, reached out to USDA for guidance as the state works to ensure that these taxpayer-funded resources are used properly within the school district\u2019s school lunch program,\u201d she said.</p>", "<p>\u201cUSDA is not imposing any additional regulations or special requirements on the state of New Hampshire or the Londonderry High School, as a result of the high school\u2019s decision to exit the National School Lunch Program.\u00a0 There is no USDA regulation that requires non-participating schools to be classified as processing facilities.\"</p>", "<p>Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., blasted the government agency for imposing \u201cburdensome\u201d costs on the local school district, and on Thursday fired off a letter to Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, urging the agency to grant Londonderry a waiver from the regulations.</p>", "<p>\u201cLocal school districts in New Hampshire that are working to both ensure proper nutrition for their students and responsibly manage taxpayer dollars should not be burdened by onerous federal requirements from Washington,\u201d Ayotte said in a statement.</p>", "<p>Rep. Frank Guinta, a Republican and one of the state\u2019s two members of Congress, said if the lunch program satisfies students, parents and local taxpayers, the federal government should butt out.</p>", "<p>\u201cUnfortunately for New Hampshire, the USDA is providing a great example for the rest of the country of what's wrong in Washington,\u201d Guinta said. \u201cFederal bureaucrats write rules that don't work and punish us when we produce alternatives. In this case, it's clear they care less about nutrition than they do about control.\u201d</p>", "<p>A USDA official said it is up to state officials to ensure compliance with the lunch program, but that state officials had reached out to the USDA regional office for guidance because of the unusual situation. But the official said it is not up to the USDA to grant a waiver and that state and federal regulators plan to meet later this month to work out a monitoring and compliance plan for Londonderry.</p>", "<p>Meanwhile, even without the new red tape the district has already paid a price by forgoing the subsidies for low income high school kids\u2019 meals. By some estimates, that alone has more than doubled the cost of each meal. Greenberg said the district never intended to wade into the politics of the school lunch program, which has been championed by First Lady Michelle Obama, yet proven extremely unpopular with older students. But he is now left wondering if the bureaucratic pushback is agenda-driven.</p>", "<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2018s the intent, but you could perceive it that way,\u201d he said. \u201cOur issue is quality lunches, healthy lunches and choice vs. healthy trash cans.\u201d</p>"]}

In the five years since the health statute became law, the GOP hasn't coalesced behind a replacement proposal.</p>", "<p>That two-year delay also keeps the impact of those provisions from being felt immediately.

It would also annul tax increases imposed to cover the law's costs, including levies on the income of higher-earning people, medical devices, costly insurance policies and tanning salons.</p>", "<p>Republicans wrapped the measure in a filibuster-proof process that requires just 51 votes for Senate passage, not the 60 usually required to end stalling tactics. The GOP controls the chamber by 54-46.</p>", "<p>Planned Parenthood, a longtime target of anti-abortion forces, has come under fire after secretly recorded videos showed group officials discussing their provision of fetal tissue to scientists.

His visits to Vientiane and Phnom Penh come ahead of a summit with the leaders of all 10 ASEAN nations that President Barack Obama will host next month in California.</p>", "<p>China, which claims sovereignty of much of the territory in the South China Sea, rejects claims from countries like the Philippines and Vietnam and has bristled at U.S. warnings that its activities threaten the freedom of navigation in some of the world's busiest commercial shipping lanes. Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei also have overlapping claims in the strategically vital sea, through which around $5 trillion in world trade passes each year.</p>", "<p>The U.S. says it takes no position on the claims but says developments in the South China Sea are a national security interest. It has urged that the disputes be settled peacefully and that a binding code of conduct be established for the area.</p>", "<p>Tensions have been especially high since Beijing transformed seven disputed reefs into islands, where it is now constructing runways and facilities that rival claimants say can be used militarily. China has said it built the islands primarily to foster safe civilian sea travel and fishing.</p>", "<p>In response, the U.S. sent a guided-missile destroyer close to one of the Chinese-built islands, called Subi Reef, in October in a challenge to Beijing's territorial claims, sparking warnings from China. U.S. officials vowed to continue maneuvers to protect freedom of navigation and overflight.</p>", "<p>Recent developments, including China's movement of an oil rig into a zone disputed with Vietnam and warnings against Philippines overflight of what it claims to be its territory, have raised those levels of concern. China dismisses the warnings as unwarranted, but has harshly criticized a U.S.-Philippines defense pact that allows American forces, warships and planes to be based temporarily in local military camps.

Testing would be one factor considered, but other measures of success or failure could include graduation rates and education atmosphere.</p>", "<p>But states would still be required to intervene in the lowest-performing 5 percent of schools, in high schools with high dropout rates and in schools with stubborn achievement gaps -- something Democrats have pushed.</p>", "<p>The measure would end the waivers the Obama administration has given to more than 40 states -- exemptions granted around the more onerous parts of No Child when it became clear that requirements such as having all students proficient in reading and math by 2014 would not be met.</p>", "<p>Three of the presidential candidates missed the Senate vote -- Republican Sens.

Broadcasters appear likely to hold onto advertising sales agreements with other stations in the same market despite a Federal Communications Commission rule curbing the practice.</p>", "<p>But the biggest storm involves numerous efforts by Republicans to fight Obama's environmental agenda, including moves to block new emissions standards for power plants, blunt an ambitious rewrite of clean water rules, prevent the administration from regulating \"fracking\" on federal lands, and curb new regulations on ozone. \u00a0 </p>", "<p>VETO THREATS MATTER\u00a0 \u00a0</p>", "<p>If Obama virulently opposes something, it isn't likely to happen.

Many Republicans want to attach a recently-passed bill -- rushed through the House in wake of last month's terror attacks in Paris -- to make it more difficult for Syrian refugees to enter the U.S. But Obama has threatened a veto of that as well, and the measure is unlikely to be attached to the omnibus, at least as written.\u00a0 \u00a0</p>", "<p>Instead, a bill that passed the House on Tuesday with broad bipartisan backing, which would tighten controls on foreigners entering the U.S., is a likely addition. \u00a0 </p>", "<p>TAX BREAKS SMORGASBORD\u00a0 \u00a0</p>", "<p>There are more than five dozen tax breaks, many of which have been in place for more than 20 years but have never been made permanent.

Rogers is pretty busy these days as Congress approaches a deadline\u00a0Friday night to fund the government.</p>", "<p>Long before Rogers came to Congress, he served as a<br> prosecutor in rural southeastern Kentucky. And as Rogers toils to keep the\u00a0government humming, he recently recalled a case from decades ago which provides\u00a0insight on the conundrum Congress now faces.</p>", "<p>The case in question involved a man who was illiterate. </p>", "<p>To handle the case appropriately, Rogers needed to know to what degree the man could read - if it all. The man told Rogers he wasn\u2019t bad with \u201cfigures\u201d but words were a problem. Rogers pressed the man to determine if he could decipher road signs.</p>", "<p>\u201c\u2019I can tell how fir (sic),\u2019\u201d replied the man, according to<br> Rogers, in a thick, Appalachian dialect, \u201c\u2019But not where to.\u2019\u201d \u00a0</p>", "<p>Such is the case for Hal Rogers these days and the fate of a massive, $1.1 trillion, omnibus spending bill to fund the government. Rogers knows how \u201cfir\u201d lawmakers must go. But he doesn\u2019t know the \u201cwhere to.\u201d </p>", "<p>The \u201cwhere to\u201d started in late September under the aegis of then-House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, and his now famous Congressional \u201cbarn-cleaning\u201d exercise. In order to leave House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisc., a \u201cclean\u201d barn, Boehner engineered a multi-faceted deal. Among other things, this pact funded the government through Dec. 11. Boehner then handed the barn keys over to Ryan and Rogers and headed for the Congressional back 40.</p>", "<p>The biggest hurdle stalling an agreement to fund the government are known on Capitol Hill as policy \u201criders.\u201d Riders are political barnacles which lawmakers sometimes latch to major bills. Sometimes they drag a bill down. Other times, they make a measure more appetizing. </p>", "<p>In other words, those who allocate the money like Rogers wouldn\u2019t have too much trouble deciding how to distribute money to run the government. But Republican lawmakers demand that the GOP leadership Velcro a number of policy riders to the omnibus in order to secure their votes. The-most-coveted riders include bolstered vetting of Syrian and Iraqi refugees, curbing President Obama\u2019s environmental policies, lifting the U.S. oil export ban and defunding Planned Parenthood.</p>", "<p>The problem is that Obama may veto a bill littered with many of these riders. Republicans seemingly need to affix the riders to the omnibus bill in order to garner GOP support. But the bill needs more than just Republican backing. In order to pass, Republicans must also win Democratic support.</p>", "<p>House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., knows exactly<br> how tenuous this process is for Ryan. After all, Ryan inherited the same\u00a0political headache from Boehner: Democrats are necessary to pass the bill. But\u00a0a bill designed to win over Democrats loses Republicans.</p>", "<p>Just last week, House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., dashed off a missive to fellow Republicans. Scalise said that many Republicans have a tradition of \u201cvoting no on tough bills while actually hoping the bill passes.\u201d Scalise argued that \u201cif there are 150 Republicans who hope the bill passes, then there should be 150 Republicans who vote yes on final passage.\u201d \u00a0</p>", "<p>The 150 number is not random.</p>", "<p>Republicans now hold 246 seats in the House. GOPers often<br> demand that a \u201cmajority of the majority\u201d vote for a measure. But that hasn\u2019t\u00a0happened a lot on big-time bills. Boehner fell into a rhythm of consistently\u00a0commanding anywhere from 28 to 90-plus Republican yeas on major pieces of\u00a0legislation with Democrats providing the difference. That\u2019s why Pelosi feels\u00a0she has leverage. Scalise may aspire to cobble together 150 years. But he might<br> be content with 124, a majority of the House majority.</p>", "<p>If not, Republicans could be forced to drop some of the\u00a0riders, earn Democratic votes and fund the government.</p>", "<p>\u201cI think (Ryan) underestimated (Pelosi),\u201d said one\u00a0Democratic lawmaker who asked not to be identified.</p>", "<p>However, Republicans counter this isn\u2019t Ryan\u2019s first dance,\u00a0either. They note he assembled high-profile budgets and a bipartisan compromise\u00a0two years ago with Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash. </p>", "<p>Pelosi isn\u2019t the only one watching the riders.</p>", "<p>\u201cProgress is being made but there is no guarantee that these vexatious, poison pill riders won\u2019t close the government,\u201d warned Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., last week. </p>", "<p>But when pressed further, Reid didn\u2019t seem too concerned about a potential government shutdown.</p>", "<p>\u201cSeriously, I feel good about the omnibus,\u201d Reid said. </p>", "<p>That might not be the case today though.</p>", "<p>The plan was for Ryan and Rogers to outline an omnibus spending framework by late last week, set it in legislative language over last weekend and perhaps have it ready for a vote sometime this week.</p>", "<p>Only that didn\u2019t happen.</p>", "<p>There was no agreement on riders. And even if there was, those close to the appropriations process indicated it would take days just to write the bill. That could catapult the process past the December 11th deadline and well into next week. Part of the issue is that the appropriators couldn\u2019t work on smaller issues until the big ones are decided.</p>", "<p>\u201cWe have a lot of things to work on,\u201d said one source close to the appropriations process. Ryan and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., announced a plan to hold members here this weekend to crank out the omnibus bill. Such a tactic is the Congressional version of the \u201cStockholm Syndrome.\u201d Keep the \u201chostages\u201d around over the weekend, away from holiday activities like trimming the tree and Christmas shopping \u2013 and by early next week, lawmakers might \u201csupport\u201d their \u201ccaptors.\u201d The maneuver could give the GOP brass a chance to involve all members in the process\u00a0\u2013 a frequent criticism leveled at Boehner. </p>", "<p>If Republican leaders kept everyone in town and engaged in omnibus negotiations, then no one could complain they were left out or blindsided. </p>", "<p>But there was a downside to this approach. The omnibus bill wasn\u2019t ready. The House didn\u2019t have major legislative traffic available for debate. And earlier this week, Democrats commandeered the House floor to make repeated motions on gun legislation. An open stage for Democrats to engage in more parliamentary chicanery on firearms wouldn\u2019t sit well with Republicans.</p>", "<p>And never mind there may not be much for members to do at all this weekend. As they say in the Broadway musical The Music Man, \u201cthe idle brain is the devil\u2019s playground\u2026.\u201d</p>", "<p>On Wednesday afternoon, McCarthy altered course and cancelled votes in the House this weekend. The House also prepped a stopgap, five-day spending bill to sidestep a government shutdown Friday night.</p>", "<p>Riders are the keys to procuring votes on this bill. And no\u00a0group is watching the performance of the Republican leadership any closer on\u00a0the omnibus than the conservative House Freedom Caucus. </p>", "<p>\u201cMy litmus test will be the appropriations bill,\u201d said Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., when asked what he thought of Ryan\u2019s performance as Speaker.</p>", "<p>\u201cUgh!\u201d exclaimed Rep. Dave Brat, R-Va., when questioned about his view on the omnibus and physically gesturing a big thumbs down sign. </p>", "<p>Brat and other conservatives don\u2019t like the price tag on the spending bill and argue that Boehner scrapped mandatory spending caps known as sequestration during his barn cleaning. So, they\u2019re looking at riders.</p>", "<p>Rep. Raul Labrador, R-Idaho, said he was \u201cworried the leadership will try to weaken\u201d a provision the House approved before Thanksgiving to toughen up standards to admit Syrian and Iraqi refugees into the U.S.</p>", "<p>\u201cIf we can\u2019t get that on the bill, I think we\u2019re going to have a pretty good fight,\u201d said Labrador.</p>", "<p>Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Ariz., said the refugee issue could be the magic elixir to win conservative votes.</p>", "<p>\u201cMost of the Freedom Caucus would probably swallow hard and vote for it,\u201d predicted Salmon.</p>", "<p>But some on Capitol Hill doubt the Freedom Caucus would ever vote yes.</p>", "<p>One senior House GOP aide told Fox that the Freedom Caucus \u201cwould always find something wrong\u201d with the omnibus and that Republican leaders \u201cshould quit fooling ourselves\u201d that those members were worth courting.</p>", "<p>But Labrador and Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., protested that assertion.</p>", "<p>\u201cThat is old rhetoric,\u201d said Meadows. \u201cYou could phone a 1-900-Pyschic line and get the same result.\u201d</p>", "<p>GOP sources asserted the response by the Freedom Caucus was<br> an effort to make themselves relevant on this debate. In short, if the Freedom\u00a0Caucus didn\u2019t give any indication there was a path to a yes vote, the leadership\u00a0may just ignore their wishes and write the bill another way \u2013 in a way to lure\u00a0Democrats.</p>", "<p>\u201cYou are in a much stronger position when you have some bipartisan buy-in, augured Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, R-Fla., a senior member of the Appropriations panel. Still, no one truly knows what the omnibus bill may look like.</p>", "<p>\u201cThis is the worst game of Etch A Sketch I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d<br> said Rep. Mike Turner (R-OH), invoking the name of the famous 1960s and \u201870s\u00a0toy. \u201cYou shake it and then you have to start all over again.\u201d</p>", "<p>So for now, the House\u00a0and Senate are prepared to approve the interim, five-day spending bill to avoid\u00a0a government shutdown on Friday. That brings us back to Hal Rogers and that\u00a0case he prosecuted so many years ago in Kentucky. The new goal is next<br> Wednesday.</p>", "<p>Lawmakers know \u201chow fir,\u201d but still not \u201cwhere to.\u201d</p>"]}

The spending legislation, which funds the government through the 2016 budget year, has become increasingly intertwined with the tax bill, which could deliver a political victory for both sides.</p>", "<p>Uncertainty remained as to whether lawmakers would pull off a major tax bill with permanent extensions benefiting both sides, or simply opt for a two-year extension of existing tax breaks. With Congress' legislative year drawing to a close, lawmakers were eager to finalize their work and head home for the holidays.</p>", "<p>\"Everything is tenuous right now. We've had meetings, there's no finality,\" Senate Minority Leader Harry, D-Nev., said late Thursday.

Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, urged lawmakers to support the bill and said it was a major improvement over what was put forward last session, which he said lacked privacy protections.</p>", "<p>\"The bill is very protective of privacy while also doing a lot to help companies protect themselves from cyberattack,\" Schiff said. \"We have to measure this against the daily invasion of our privacy by these hackers. Those who believe that perfect should be the enemy of the good, have to justify how they're willing to accept rampant hacking into our privacy and do nothing about it.\"</p>", "<p>Companies are also assured they won't face liability for not acting on information received. Such liability protections are necessary to incentivize data sharing with the government, and have been a major reason why prior bills have failed to pass. Supporters of the cyber sharing bill say it's necessary to raise the cost to an attacker and ensure the same threats aren't repeatedly deployed.</p>", "<p>The bill also calls on businesses and the government to remove, or scrub, personal identifiable information from threat data before sharing that information.</p>", "<p>The first scrub is done by the company when it shares with the Homeland Security Department, and the second when DHS passes it on to other agencies. However, if the cyber threat pertains to a specific threat of the loss of life, economic damage, serious injury or the effort to prosecute or prevent the exploitation of a minor, the personal identifiable information may be passed on.</p>", "<p>Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., called the bill \"even worse\" today, lacking meaningful privacy protections to ensure personal information isn't passed on and doing little to prevent major hacks.</p>", "<p>\"Americans deserve policies that protect both their security and their liberty. This bill fails on both counts,\" Wyden said.</p>", "<p>The ACLU called the cyber bill \"a surveillance bill by another name\" in a statement.</p>", "<p>\"Instead of passing reforms that would have stopped the Anthem or OPM (Office of Personnel Management) hack, Congress has chosen to advance legislation that places the privacy of Americans in further peril,\" it said, adding that the information could be used for criminal prosecutions unrelated to cybersecurity.</p>", "<p>The White House has supported prior language in the cybersecurity bill.</p>", "<p>The House is scheduled to vote Friday on the bill.</p>"]}

Rogers is pretty busy these days as Congress approaches a deadline\u00a0Friday night to fund the government.</p>", "<p>Long before Rogers came to Congress, he served as a<br> prosecutor in rural southeastern Kentucky. And as Rogers toils to keep the\u00a0government humming, he recently recalled a case from decades ago which provides\u00a0insight on the conundrum Congress now faces.</p>", "<p>The case in question involved a man who was illiterate. </p>", "<p>To handle the case appropriately, Rogers needed to know to what degree the man could read - if it all. The man told Rogers he wasn\u2019t bad with \u201cfigures\u201d but words were a problem. Rogers pressed the man to determine if he could decipher road signs.</p>", "<p>\u201c\u2019I can tell how fir (sic),\u2019\u201d replied the man, according to<br> Rogers, in a thick, Appalachian dialect, \u201c\u2019But not where to.\u2019\u201d \u00a0</p>", "<p>Such is the case for Hal Rogers these days and the fate of a massive, $1.1 trillion, omnibus spending bill to fund the government. Rogers knows how \u201cfir\u201d lawmakers must go. But he doesn\u2019t know the \u201cwhere to.\u201d </p>", "<p>The \u201cwhere to\u201d started in late September under the aegis of then-House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, and his now famous Congressional \u201cbarn-cleaning\u201d exercise. In order to leave House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisc., a \u201cclean\u201d barn, Boehner engineered a multi-faceted deal. Among other things, this pact funded the government through Dec. 11. Boehner then handed the barn keys over to Ryan and Rogers and headed for the Congressional back 40.</p>", "<p>The biggest hurdle stalling an agreement to fund the government are known on Capitol Hill as policy \u201criders.\u201d Riders are political barnacles which lawmakers sometimes latch to major bills. Sometimes they drag a bill down. Other times, they make a measure more appetizing. </p>", "<p>In other words, those who allocate the money like Rogers wouldn\u2019t have too much trouble deciding how to distribute money to run the government. But Republican lawmakers demand that the GOP leadership Velcro a number of policy riders to the omnibus in order to secure their votes. The-most-coveted riders include bolstered vetting of Syrian and Iraqi refugees, curbing President Obama\u2019s environmental policies, lifting the U.S. oil export ban and defunding Planned Parenthood.</p>", "<p>The problem is that Obama may veto a bill littered with many of these riders. Republicans seemingly need to affix the riders to the omnibus bill in order to garner GOP support. But the bill needs more than just Republican backing. In order to pass, Republicans must also win Democratic support.</p>", "<p>House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., knows exactly<br> how tenuous this process is for Ryan. After all, Ryan inherited the same\u00a0political headache from Boehner: Democrats are necessary to pass the bill. But\u00a0a bill designed to win over Democrats loses Republicans.</p>", "<p>Just last week, House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., dashed off a missive to fellow Republicans. Scalise said that many Republicans have a tradition of \u201cvoting no on tough bills while actually hoping the bill passes.\u201d Scalise argued that \u201cif there are 150 Republicans who hope the bill passes, then there should be 150 Republicans who vote yes on final passage.\u201d \u00a0</p>", "<p>The 150 number is not random.</p>", "<p>Republicans now hold 246 seats in the House. GOPers often<br> demand that a \u201cmajority of the majority\u201d vote for a measure. But that hasn\u2019t\u00a0happened a lot on big-time bills. Boehner fell into a rhythm of consistently\u00a0commanding anywhere from 28 to 90-plus Republican yeas on major pieces of\u00a0legislation with Democrats providing the difference. That\u2019s why Pelosi feels\u00a0she has leverage. Scalise may aspire to cobble together 150 years. But he might<br> be content with 124, a majority of the House majority.</p>", "<p>If not, Republicans could be forced to drop some of the\u00a0riders, earn Democratic votes and fund the government.</p>", "<p>\u201cI think (Ryan) underestimated (Pelosi),\u201d said one\u00a0Democratic lawmaker who asked not to be identified.</p>", "<p>However, Republicans counter this isn\u2019t Ryan\u2019s first dance,\u00a0either. They note he assembled high-profile budgets and a bipartisan compromise\u00a0two years ago with Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash. </p>", "<p>Pelosi isn\u2019t the only one watching the riders.</p>", "<p>\u201cProgress is being made but there is no guarantee that these vexatious, poison pill riders won\u2019t close the government,\u201d warned Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., last week. </p>", "<p>But when pressed further, Reid didn\u2019t seem too concerned about a potential government shutdown.</p>", "<p>\u201cSeriously, I feel good about the omnibus,\u201d Reid said. </p>", "<p>That might not be the case today though.</p>", "<p>The plan was for Ryan and Rogers to outline an omnibus spending framework by late last week, set it in legislative language over last weekend and perhaps have it ready for a vote sometime this week.</p>", "<p>Only that didn\u2019t happen.</p>", "<p>There was no agreement on riders. And even if there was, those close to the appropriations process indicated it would take days just to write the bill. That could catapult the process past the December 11th deadline and well into next week. Part of the issue is that the appropriators couldn\u2019t work on smaller issues until the big ones are decided.</p>", "<p>\u201cWe have a lot of things to work on,\u201d said one source close to the appropriations process. Ryan and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., announced a plan to hold members here this weekend to crank out the omnibus bill. Such a tactic is the Congressional version of the \u201cStockholm Syndrome.\u201d Keep the \u201chostages\u201d around over the weekend, away from holiday activities like trimming the tree and Christmas shopping \u2013 and by early next week, lawmakers might \u201csupport\u201d their \u201ccaptors.\u201d The maneuver could give the GOP brass a chance to involve all members in the process\u00a0\u2013 a frequent criticism leveled at Boehner. </p>", "<p>If Republican leaders kept everyone in town and engaged in omnibus negotiations, then no one could complain they were left out or blindsided. </p>", "<p>But there was a downside to this approach. The omnibus bill wasn\u2019t ready. The House didn\u2019t have major legislative traffic available for debate. And earlier this week, Democrats commandeered the House floor to make repeated motions on gun legislation. An open stage for Democrats to engage in more parliamentary chicanery on firearms wouldn\u2019t sit well with Republicans.</p>", "<p>And never mind there may not be much for members to do at all this weekend. As they say in the Broadway musical The Music Man, \u201cthe idle brain is the devil\u2019s playground\u2026.\u201d</p>", "<p>On Wednesday afternoon, McCarthy altered course and cancelled votes in the House this weekend. The House also prepped a stopgap, five-day spending bill to sidestep a government shutdown Friday night.</p>", "<p>Riders are the keys to procuring votes on this bill. And no\u00a0group is watching the performance of the Republican leadership any closer on\u00a0the omnibus than the conservative House Freedom Caucus. </p>", "<p>\u201cMy litmus test will be the appropriations bill,\u201d said Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., when asked what he thought of Ryan\u2019s performance as Speaker.</p>", "<p>\u201cUgh!\u201d exclaimed Rep. Dave Brat, R-Va., when questioned about his view on the omnibus and physically gesturing a big thumbs down sign. </p>", "<p>Brat and other conservatives don\u2019t like the price tag on the spending bill and argue that Boehner scrapped mandatory spending caps known as sequestration during his barn cleaning. So, they\u2019re looking at riders.</p>", "<p>Rep. Raul Labrador, R-Idaho, said he was \u201cworried the leadership will try to weaken\u201d a provision the House approved before Thanksgiving to toughen up standards to admit Syrian and Iraqi refugees into the U.S.</p>", "<p>\u201cIf we can\u2019t get that on the bill, I think we\u2019re going to have a pretty good fight,\u201d said Labrador.</p>", "<p>Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Ariz., said the refugee issue could be the magic elixir to win conservative votes.</p>", "<p>\u201cMost of the Freedom Caucus would probably swallow hard and vote for it,\u201d predicted Salmon.</p>", "<p>But some on Capitol Hill doubt the Freedom Caucus would ever vote yes.</p>", "<p>One senior House GOP aide told Fox that the Freedom Caucus \u201cwould always find something wrong\u201d with the omnibus and that Republican leaders \u201cshould quit fooling ourselves\u201d that those members were worth courting.</p>", "<p>But Labrador and Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., protested that assertion.</p>", "<p>\u201cThat is old rhetoric,\u201d said Meadows. \u201cYou could phone a 1-900-Pyschic line and get the same result.\u201d</p>", "<p>GOP sources asserted the response by the Freedom Caucus was<br> an effort to make themselves relevant on this debate. In short, if the Freedom\u00a0Caucus didn\u2019t give any indication there was a path to a yes vote, the leadership\u00a0may just ignore their wishes and write the bill another way \u2013 in a way to lure\u00a0Democrats.</p>", "<p>\u201cYou are in a much stronger position when you have some bipartisan buy-in, augured Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, R-Fla., a senior member of the Appropriations panel. Still, no one truly knows what the omnibus bill may look like.</p>", "<p>\u201cThis is the worst game of Etch A Sketch I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d<br> said Rep. Mike Turner (R-OH), invoking the name of the famous 1960s and \u201870s\u00a0toy. \u201cYou shake it and then you have to start all over again.\u201d</p>", "<p>So for now, the House\u00a0and Senate are prepared to approve the interim, five-day spending bill to avoid\u00a0a government shutdown on Friday. That brings us back to Hal Rogers and that\u00a0case he prosecuted so many years ago in Kentucky.

Syria's conflict has killed more than 250,000 people, displaced millions and sent hundreds of thousands as refugees to Europe.</p>", "<p>The first meeting was between the U.N. Special Envoy to Syria Staffan de Mistura and a government delegation headed by the country's ambassador to the U.N., Bashar Ja'afari. \u00a0A U.N. spokesman said that he would later meet with other delegates, including civil society representatives.</p>", "<p>The main opposition delegation has said it will not participate without an end to the bombardment of civilians by Russian and government forces and a lifting of sieges in rebel-held areas.</p>", "<p>The meetings are part of a process outlined in a U.N. resolution last month that envisages an 18-month timetable for a political transition in Syria, including the drafting of a new constitution and elections.</p>", "<p>The opposition boycott is a blow to the U.N.'s attempt to bring representatives of President Bashar Assad's government and his opponents together for talks on ending the conflict. On the eve of the talks, de Mistura appealed to Syrians to make concessions and described the talks as \"an opportunity not to be missed.\"</p>", "<p>Disputes are ongoing over which opposition parties will attend, with the main opposition group -- known as the Higher Negotiating Committee, or HNC-- coming under criticism for including the militant Army of Islam group that controls wide areas near the Syrian capital, Damascus, and is considered a terrorist organization by the Syrian government and Russia.</p>", "<p>Earlier on Friday U.N. spokesman Ahmad Fawzi reflected the sense of chaos and confusion surrounding the beginning of peace negotiations when he told reporters at a briefing that \"I don't have a time, I don't have the exact location, and I can't tell you anything about the delegation.\"</p>", "<p>The HNC said it was still waiting for an official response from the United Nations about a list of concerns.</p>", "<p>Ahmad Ramadan, a senior official with the Syrian National Coalition, which is part of the HNC, said the opposition will boycott the talks until it receives assurances on the implementation of U.N. Security Council resolutions on lifting the sieges and halting bombardment of civilians in Syria.</p>", "<p>\"There cannot be any negotiations as long as the humanitarian issues have not been discussed or implemented,\" he said.</p>", "<p>Ramadan said that de Mistura sent a letter on Thursday to the head of the HNC, Riad Hijab, which was deemed unsatisfactory. He and another opposition figure, Khaled Nasser, said the U.N. envoy wrote that the opposition's demands were reasonable and that humanitarian issues should be \"above negotiations,\" but that he was powerless to implement them himself, adding that negotiations were the best way to force everyone to implement those resolutions.</p>", "<p>Basma Kodmani, a member of the opposition's negotiating team, said the HNC is now studying whether their delegation will come to Geneva to raise these concerns with the U.N. officials or stay in Saudi Arabia where they can raise them from a distance.</p>", "<p>In Syria, the official Tishrin newspaper boasted that the no-show by the Saudi and Turkey-backed opposition in Geneva \"reflects the collective flight of terrorist groups backed by Saudi Arabia and Turkey from the political table, following their collapses on the battlefield.\"</p>", "<p>Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said that the moderate opposition was not attending the talks because Russia continues to bomb opposition-held areas in Syria, and that it is a \"betrayal\" to the moderate opposition to ask them to attend without a cease-fire.\u00a0</p>", "<p>A Western diplomat in close contact with the SNC said in Geneva that \"their (HNC) main message to us has been while we are under sustained attack by Russia and the regime and other states and militants and other groups we cannot justify to Syrians why we are going.\"</p>", "<p>\"We tell them the reason to come here is not to hand the Assad regime a propaganda victory,\" said the diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak on behalf of the opposition.</p>", "<p>Opposition figures from outside the HNC are in Geneva, but they were invited as advisers. The HNC is supposed to be the main opposition group in the talks.</p>", "<p>But a leading Syrian opposition figure who is not part of the HNC and is currently in Geneva hinted that his team will be part of the talks as a second opposition delegation.</p>", "<p>\"The presence of three delegations expresses the will of the (U.N.) Security Council who called for a delegation representing all parties of the opposition,\" former Syrian deputy prime minister, Qadri Jamil, said in an interview with The Associated Press.</p>", "<p>Jamil added that in their talks with the government the priority will be to allow aid into besieged areas and that all Syrians unite to \"fight the terrorism represented by Nusra and Daesh.\" He was referring to al-Qaida's branch in Syria known as the Nusra Front and using an Arabic acronym to refer to the Islamic State group.</p>", "<p>De Mistura said Thursday that Geneva peace talks are an opportunity not to be missed.</p>", "<p>\u00a0</p>"]}

The Senate approved the bill a day earlier, its easy sojourn through Congress underscoring that neither party saw reason to risk a government shutdown battle.</p>", "<p>Lawmakers voted for the short-term measure to allow more time on twin year-end deals that come with dozens of unresolved issues.</p>", "<p>Ahead of Friday's vote, Democrats criticized majority Republicans for running up against a government shutdown deadline yet again, requiring passage of the so-called \"continuing resolution\" to keep agencies funded through next Wednesday.</p>", "<p>\"Even after we pass this CR, today we'll be just five days away from a government shutdown.

The spending legislation, which funds the government through the 2016 budget year, has become increasingly intertwined with the tax bill, which could deliver a political victory for both sides.</p>", "<p>Uncertainty remained as to whether lawmakers would pull off a major tax bill with permanent extensions benefiting both sides, or simply opt for a two-year extension of existing tax breaks. With Congress' legislative year drawing to a close, lawmakers were eager to finalize their work and head home for the holidays.</p>", "<p>\"Everything is tenuous right now. We've had meetings, there's no finality,\" Senate Minority Leader Harry, D-Nev., said late Thursday. He said sticking points relate to labor and environmental issues, and a campaign finance provision pushed by his Republican counterpart, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, to lift certain spending limits by party committees.</p>", "<p>A two-year budget and debt deal passed earlier this year set the overall spending levels, but that left it up to the powerful Appropriations Committee to allocate the money ahead of the deadline for a partial government shutdown.

The two blimps had been in testing mode, hovering some 10,000 feet over the Washington D.C. area and carrying sophisticated radar designed to detect and track airborne threats including cruise missiles. Operated by NORAD (North American Aerospace Defense Command), the blimps are supposed have 360-degree situational awareness and be able to stay aloft for 30 days at a time.</p>", "<p>The Los Angeles Times reported that the runaway blimp had been taking part in an exercise that was scheduled to begin in January. However, problems with computer software delayed the launch of a required second blimp until mid-August.</p>", "<p>JLENS has endured bad publicity from the start. In 2010, the prototype airship costing the Pentagon about $182 million <a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d11233sp.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">was destroyed </a>when a civilian blimp unmoored in a storm and crashed into it at a manufacturing facility in North Carolina. Then, after a series of problems with cost and performance, the Pentagon was forced to scale back the project in 2012, effectively quashing production of any new machines beyond the two already produced.</p>", "<p>In the meantime, the reviews have been lackluster at best -- in 2012 and 2013, the Pentagon\u2019s Operational Test and Evaluation Office said the blimps were not meeting operational goals, in one case charging that JLENS \u201c<a href=\"http://www.dote.osd.mil/pub/reports/FY2013/pdf/army/2013jlens.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">did not demonstrate the ability to survive in its intended operational environment</a>.\u201d The evaluation also found flaws in the airships\u2019 software and communications programs.</p>", "<p>But with consistent lobbying by Raytheon, the program has lived on like a \u201czombie,\u201d racking up $2.7 billion in costs by 2014, <a href=\"http://graphics.latimes.com/missile-defense-jlens/\" target=\"_blank\">The Los Angeles Times reported</a> in September.</p>", "<p>Despite the setbacks and criticism, JLENS was spared from a $5 billion cut to a revised version of the massive defense policy bill to align it with the new budget agreement President Obama signed into law.</p>", "<p>Obama had initially vetoed the $612 billion defense authorization bill over a larger dispute over government spending.

Closing the prison was a priority of Obama's 2008 presidential campaign, and he promised during his first days in office that he would eventually shutter the facility, which he argues is costly and gives extremists a recruiting tool.\u00a0</p>", "<p>But the administration has faced strong resistance from Republicans and some Democrats in Congress who oppose moving the terror suspects to prisons in the U.S.\u00a0</p>", "<p>The White House is preparing to release the administration's plan to close the prison, which is expected to propose transferring some detainees to places in the United States where they could be securely held -- an idea that already has drawn heavy opposition on Capitol Hill. The law currently bans detainees from being transferred to U.S. soil, but facilities in several states, including Kansas, South Carolina and Colorado have been discussed.\u00a0</p>", "<p>On Wednesday, White House press secretary Josh Earnest hinted that the president might use his executive authority to close the prison. Obama wants to work with Congress to close Guantanamo Bay, but \"if Congress continues to refuse,\" the president will explore all other options, Earnest said.\u00a0</p>", "<p>That prompted Sen. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., to place a hold on Obama's nominee for the secretary of the Army, Eric Fanning, to prevent the White House from taking executive action to close Guantanamo Bay and transfer detainees to the United States.\u00a0</p>", "<p>The other Republican members of the Kansas delegation -- Sen.

Now, members of Congress want to know whether U.S. taxpayers are funding a program that is more trouble than it\u2019s worth.\u00a0</p>", "<p>\u201cThis event raises questions about the value and reliability of JLENS,\u201d wrote Reps. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, and Elijah Cummings, D-Md., chairman and ranking member of the House oversight committee, respectively, in joint letters to Defense Secretary Ashton Carter and Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx on Thursday. They asked for all DOD and DOT contracts and documents relating to JLENS no later than Nov. 12, to help them \u201cunderstand whether JLENS is a worthwhile investment of taxpayer dollars.\u201d\u00a0</p>", "<p>The two blimps had been in testing mode, hovering some 10,000 feet over the national capital area and carrying sophisticated radar designed to detect and track airborne threats including cruise missiles.

Dan Grazier, who now works as a national security analyst for the Project on Government Oversight. He told FoxNews.com that the optics of a runaway blimp on Wednesday, trailed by two F-16 fighter jets and dragging a 6,000-foot tether behind, did not bode well for the military, or for the builder of the JLENS blimps, Raytheon Co., <a href=\"http://www.shephardmedia.com/news/digital-battlespace/ausa-2015-through-jlens/\" target=\"_blank\">which had hoped to sell the machines on the international market.</a></p>", "<p>\u201cIt\u2019s certainly a laughing stock now,\u201d Grazier said to FoxNews.com. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is a very good way to publicize a program.\u201d\u00a0</p>", "<p>The incident provided fodder for Wednesday's Republican presidential debate, where former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/28/huckabee-finds-runaway-army-blimp-perfect-example-government-on-loose/\" target=\"_blank\">mocked it as a \"perfect\" symbol</a> for bloated government programs.\u00a0</p>", "<p>JLENS has endured bad publicity from the start. In 2010, the prototype airship costing the Pentagon about $182 million <a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d11233sp.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">was destroyed</a> when a civilian blimp unmoored in a storm and crashed into it at a manufacturing facility in North Carolina. Then, after a series of problems with cost and performance, the Pentagon was forced to scale back the project in 2012, effectively quashing production of any new machines beyond the two already produced.\u00a0</p>", "<p>In the meantime, the reviews have been lackluster at best -- in 2012 and 2013, the Pentagon\u2019s Operational Test and Evaluation Office said the blimps were not meeting operational goals, in one case charging that JLENS <a href=\"http://www.dote.osd.mil/pub/reports/FY2013/pdf/army/2013jlens.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">\u201cdid not demonstrate the ability to survive in its intended operational environment.\u201d </a>The evaluation also found flaws in the airships\u2019 software and communications programs.\u00a0</p>", "<p>But with consistent lobbying by Raytheon, the program has lived on like a \u201czombie,\u201d racking up $2.7 billion in costs by 2014, <a href=\"http://graphics.latimes.com/missile-defense-jlens/\" target=\"_blank\">The Los Angeles Times</a> said in an investigation in September.\u00a0</p>", "<p>The two remaining blimps were supposed stay in their place in the latest three-year test, some 10,000 feet over the Aberdeen Proving Ground. Raytheon<a href=\"http://www.raytheon.com/capabilities/rtnwcm/groups/gallery/documents/digitalasset/rtn_175001.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> insisted in promotional materials</a> that the tether, which \u201ccarries power up to the JLENS radar,\u201d is made of Vectran and \u201chas withstood storms in the excess of 100 knots.\u201d\u00a0</p>", "<p>However, in the \u201cunlikely event\u201d a ship becomes unmoored, according to Raytheon, \u201cthere are a number of procedures and systems in place which are designed to bring the aerostat down in a safe manner.\u201d\u00a0</p>", "<p>While no one was injured in this week\u2019s accident, some 30,000 homes in the path of the dragging tether lost power, according to reports. Rep. Lou Barletta, R-Pa., told the press Wednesday during the incident that \u201cthe blimp left quite a bit of damage at ground level in its path, including disrupting power to thousands of my constituents.\u201d\u00a0</p>", "<p>Calls to the Defense Department for comment were not returned Friday. Recovery teams were on the ground collecting equipment and an Army investigation is underway to find out exactly what happened to cause the ship to break free.\u00a0</p>", "<p>Grazier said it is time to rethink the future of the program.\u00a0</p>", "<p>\u201cI can tell you from personal experience that this is not the first time one of these things has broken from its mooring,\u201d he said, recalling while serving in the war, a surveillance blimp operated by the U.S. in Afghanistan drifted off with \u201cclassified equipment\u201d and had to be shot down before it sailed into Pakistan.\u00a0</p>", "<p>\u201cThis is not exactly the Civil War anymore.

Obama has argued the facility is an egregious symbol of inmate abuse and detention without charge and one he plans to close -- despite strong opposition from a Republican-controlled Congress. The prison camp was established by his predecessor, former President George W. Bush, after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks terror attacks.</p>", "<p>Many defense experts argue that the transfer of terror suspects, like Kandari, to their homelands ensures \"without a doubt\" their return to a radicalized life aimed at harming the U.S. and its allies.</p>", "<p>\"The likelihood of their returning to jihadism is extraordinary high,\" said Gen. Jack Keane, a retired four-star general and a Fox News contributor.</p>", "<p>\"When the number [of inmates] dropped below 200, most people know we're dealing with hardcore, true believers not prone to be rehabilitiated,\" Keane, former vice chief of staff of the U.S. Army, told FoxNews.com Wednesday.</p>", "<p>Kandari was assessed to be a committed member of Al Qaeda who served as adviser and confidant to 9/11 mastermind Usama Bin Laden, according to U.S. officials. He also provided ideological education to trainees of the terrorist network at the al-Faruq Training Camp and the Islamic Institute in Kandahar.</p>", "<p>Kandari, who was captured while he was heading down the Tora Bora Mountains into Pakistan, was first detained in Jalalabad before he was was transferred to Gitmo in May 2002. In 2008, he was assessed to be a \"high risk\" to the U.S., its interests and allies, according to the Defense Department.\u00a0</p>", "<p>For many defense experts, Kandari's release is reminiscent of\u00a0Abdallah Saleh Ali Al Ajmi, a Kuwaiti citizen held at Gitmo who was eventually released back to the Gulf nation, where he was tried and acquitted. In March 2008, a few months after his release, Al Ajmi drove a truck bomb into a compound in Mosul, killing 13, including himself, and wounding 43.</p>", "<p>The attack was later praised by Al Qaeda in a propaganda video and described by one soldier who witnessed it as looking like the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing.</p>", "<p>\"Kuwait is far from an ideal partner on counter-terrorism issues,\" said Ryan Mauro, national security analyst from the Washington, D.C.-based Clarion Project.</p>", "<p>\"The administration's own officials have blasted Kuwait for giving a permissive environment to terrorists waging jihad in Syria,\" Mauro told FoxNews.com. \"In 2014, one Treasury Department official publicly said, 'Our ally Kuwait has become the epicenter of fundraising for terrorist groups in Syria.'\"</p>", "<p>\"Why would the U.S. trust a government known for allowing a permissive environment for jihadists in Syria with hosting a former Gitmo detainee who would undoubtedly be interested in the jihad in Syria?\" questioned Mauro.</p>", "<p>A parole-style Periodic Review Board determined in September that Kandari's detention was no longer needed. Obama created the board -- made up of six intelligence and national security agencies -- in 2011. Once prisoners are approved for transfer, the U.S. government must find countries willing to accept them and offer security -- a plan defense experts, like Keane, have roundly criticized.\u00a0</p>", "<p>\"There is tremendous pressure on the Department of Defense,\" said Keane. \"Even when they [Defense officials]\u00a0vote them down as a 'no' for transfer, the White House pushes them again weeks later to put\u00a0them through the screening test again.\"\u00a0</p>", "<p>\"The transfer makes no sense whatsoever to people familiar with them,\" Keane said of the inmates recently released from Gitmo.</p>", "<p>\"There is no monitoring system that the country\u00a0is going to use and in most cases there is no travel restriction,\" he said.\u00a0</p>"]}

Translation: the gas pipelines, and the gas, aren\u2019t necessarily in the right place to match the new tasks.</p>", "<p>\u201cIt is not as easy to replace coal with natural gas as it is to say it,\u201d he told Fox News\u2014especially without adequate time to study how to go about the challenge.</p>", "<p>According to a submission by David Bracht, head of the Nebraska Energy Office\u2014the former head of a legal firm\u2019s renewable energy group and private-sector advisor on major wind and ethanol projects\u2014the changes that states must propose \u201cover the next calendar year will be irreversible and will impact the electric grid for decades.\u201d</p>", "<p>In Nebraska\u2019s case, he declared, they would also disrupt an 80-year tradition of local public control of utilities and likely give unprecedented control instead to multi-state regional power authorities, which in turn would require \u201clegislative and constitutional changes on the state level that may permanently alter the daily operation of utilities.\u201d</p>", "<p>In addition, he told Fox News by telephone, \u201cit seems notable to me that many of the EPA\u2019s deadlines do not reflect the long-term needs of the energy industry.\u201d</p>", "<p>Power generating assets \u201ctypically have lives of 50 years,\u201d he said, while the planning horizons for transmission facilities can be 3-8 years.\u201d\u00a0 The switching of power sources envisaged by the EPA\u2019s plan also means the planning, design and creation of \u201cmajor backbone transmission lines where they do not currently exist.\u201d</p>", "<p>Nebraska gets about 50 percent of its electrical energy from coal, Bracht said, and under the earlier version of the EPA\u2019s rule, it was supposed to cut 26 per cent of its carbon emissions from 2012 levels. In the final rule that the states are not litigating, the total jumped to 40 per cent.</p>", "<p>And when it comes to shifting from coal to less carbon-emitting fuels like natural gas, he declared, \u201cthe coal-fired plant does not necessarily have a natural gas pipeline next to it for its replacement.\u201d\u00a0</p>", "<p>\u201cThere are very few people in the United States who don\u2019t expect the lights to work when they turn them on,\u201d he said. \u201cThe kind of disruption this shift implies might test that.\u201d</p>", "<p><i>George Russell is editor-at-large of Fox News and can be found on Twitter: \u00a0@GeorgeRussell or on Facebook.com/GeorgeRussell</i></p>"]}

Obama has argued the facility is an egregious symbol of inmate abuse and detention without charge and one he plans to close -- despite strong opposition from a Republican-controlled Congress. The prison camp was established by his predecessor, former President George W. Bush, after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks terror attacks.</p>", "<p>Many defense experts argue that the transfer of terror suspects, like Kandari, to their homelands ensures \"without a doubt\" their return to a radicalized life aimed at harming the U.S. and its allies.</p>", "<p>\"The likelihood of their returning to jihadism is extraordinary high,\" said Gen. Jack Keane, a retired four-star general and a Fox News contributor.</p>", "<p>\"When the number [of inmates] dropped below 200, most people know we're dealing with hardcore, true believers not prone to be rehabilitiated,\" Keane, former vice chief of staff of the U.S. Army, told FoxNews.com Wednesday.</p>", "<p>Kandari was assessed to be a committed member of Al Qaeda who served as adviser and confidant to 9/11 mastermind Usama Bin Laden, according to U.S. officials. He also provided ideological education to trainees of the terrorist network at the al-Faruq Training Camp and the Islamic Institute in Kandahar.</p>", "<p>Kandari, who was captured while he was heading down the Tora Bora Mountains into Pakistan, was first detained in Jalalabad before he was was transferred to Gitmo in May 2002. In 2008, he was assessed to be a \"high risk\" to the U.S., its interests and allies, according to the Defense Department.\u00a0</p>", "<p>For many defense experts, Kandari's release is reminiscent of\u00a0Abdallah Saleh Ali Al Ajmi, a Kuwaiti citizen held at Gitmo who was eventually released back to the Gulf nation, where he was tried and acquitted. In March 2008, a few months after his release, Al Ajmi drove a truck bomb into a compound in Mosul, killing 13, including himself, and wounding 43.</p>", "<p>The attack was later praised by Al Qaeda in a propaganda video and described by one soldier who witnessed it as looking like the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing.</p>", "<p>\"Kuwait is far from an ideal partner on counter-terrorism issues,\" said Ryan Mauro, national security analyst from the Washington, D.C.-based Clarion Project.</p>", "<p>\"The administration's own officials have blasted Kuwait for giving a permissive environment to terrorists waging jihad in Syria,\" Mauro told FoxNews.com. \"In 2014, one Treasury Department official publicly said, 'Our ally Kuwait has become the epicenter of fundraising for terrorist groups in Syria.'\"</p>", "<p>\"Why would the U.S. trust a government known for allowing a permissive environment for jihadists in Syria with hosting a former Gitmo detainee who would undoubtedly be interested in the jihad in Syria?\" questioned Mauro.</p>", "<p>A parole-style Periodic Review Board determined in September that Kandari's detention was no longer needed. Obama created the board -- made up of six intelligence and national security agencies -- in 2011. Once prisoners are approved for transfer, the U.S. government must find countries willing to accept them and offer security -- a plan defense experts, like Keane, have roundly criticized.\u00a0</p>", "<p>\"There is tremendous pressure on the Department of Defense,\" said Keane. \"Even when they [Defense officials]\u00a0vote them down as a 'no' for transfer, the White House pushes them again weeks later to put\u00a0them through the screening test again.\"\u00a0</p>", "<p>\"The transfer makes no sense whatsoever to people familiar with them,\" Keane said of the inmates recently released from Gitmo.</p>", "<p>\"There is no monitoring system that the country\u00a0is going to use and in most cases there is no travel restriction,\" he said.\u00a0</p>"]}

Kevin Stephens said in discussing this trend of Iranian provocation near U.S. aircraft carrier battle groups.</p>", "<p>In April, as the USS Theodore Roosevelt exited the Strait of Hormuz to pursue an Iranian flotilla carrying weapons in the direction of Yemen, a group of Iranian Revolutionary Guard small boats launched 11 unguided rockets five nautical miles from the aircraft carrier, Stephens said. One nautical mile equals 1.151\u00a0miles.</p>", "<p>In October 2014, a Navy helicopter from the USS George H.W. Bush also observed Iranian small boats launching several unguided rockets about eight nautical miles away, he said.</p>", "<p>The group of missile boats that approached the USS Harry S. Truman, as well as her escort ships, the day after Christmas launched missiles within 1,500 yards of the aircraft carrier following an impromptu announcement over bridge-to-bridge maritime radio just 23 minutes earlier.

Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., wrote a letter to President Obama, signed by 35 of her GOP Senate colleagues, calling on the administration not to lift sanctions on Iran.</p>", "<p>The launch in November followed a much more publicized ballistic missile launch inside Iran in October, which drew condemnation from U.S. Ambassador to the U.N.

If states fail to make the initial submission, EPA says it will offer up its own versions of what they will have to do.</p>", "<p>By starting the deadline clock before publication in the <i>Federal Register</i>\u2014which the lawsuit claims could take three to four months beyond Aug. 3 - the states charge that EPA at a minimum is forcing them to restructure priorities and prematurely throw thousands of hours of planning time at the rule before they can legally contest the plan and its 2018 final deadline.</p>", "<p>For its part, EPA says that <i>Federal Register</i> publication is irrelevant, and that the \u201cpromulgation\u201d of the rule on Aug. 3 - when EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy signed the rule and posted it on the EPA website - is what matters.</p>", "<p>In a hint at another reason for EPA\u2019s hurry-up schedule, an EPA statement says the plan \u201cshows the world that the United States is committed to leading global efforts to address climate change\u201d\u2014a tacit reference to a United Nations-backed global climate change summit planned for Paris in December, where supporters hope to endorse a new legally binding treaty on greenhouse gas limits.</p>", "<p>The dissenting states - they range from Florida and Louisiana to Michigan, Ohio and Indiana - have already condemned the huge plan as an unprecedented extension of EPA authority under a little-used section of the Clean Air Act, and an illegal intrusion on their own power to regulate electrical generation systems.</p>", "<p>Almost all of them \u00a0add that the \u00a0mammoth scale of the imposed changes go much further than a proposed version of the rule published a year ago, and require five to 10 years to plan adequately and safely.</p>", "<p>In many cases, they add, they simply do not have the legal authority to comply with the terms of the rule as they unofficially know it, without getting additional legislative authority that could itself take years to obtain.</p>", "<p>Some of them point out they are already being greatly overstretched in struggling to comply with a blizzard of other EPA regulations governing ozone, methane, and other substances that are coming at them all more or less simultaneously.</p>", "<p>The Appeals Court lawsuit, however, claims EPA is additionally cheating with its initial Sept. 26 deadline, which it says is a major departure from regular practice.

We want to ensure that no more taxpayer money or resources are wastefully spent in an attempt to comply with this unlawful rule that we believe will ultimately be thrown out in court.\u201d</p>", "<p>Dan Goldblatt, a spokesman for the Indiana Department of Environmental Management, said the carbon emissions goal his state faces by 2030 under the final rule \u201cis nearly twice as stringent\u201d as it was under the proposed version.

Translation: the gas pipelines, and the gas, aren\u2019t necessarily in the right place to match the new tasks.</p>", "<p>\u201cIt is not as easy to replace coal with natural gas as it is to say it,\u201d he told Fox News\u2014especially without adequate time to study how to go about the challenge.</p>", "<p>According to a submission by David Bracht, head of the Nebraska Energy Office\u2014the former head of a legal firm\u2019s renewable energy group and private-sector advisor on major wind and ethanol projects\u2014the changes that states must propose \u201cover the next calendar year will be irreversible and will impact the electric grid for decades.\u201d</p>", "<p>In Nebraska\u2019s case, he declared, they would also disrupt an 80-year tradition of local public control of utilities and likely give unprecedented control instead to multi-state regional power authorities, which in turn would require \u201clegislative and constitutional changes on the state level that may permanently alter the daily operation of utilities.\u201d</p>", "<p>In addition, he told Fox News by telephone, \u201cit seems notable to me that many of the EPA\u2019s deadlines do not reflect the long-term needs of the energy industry.\u201d</p>", "<p>Power generating assets \u201ctypically have lives of 50 years,\u201d he said, while the planning horizons for transmission facilities can be 3-8 years.\u201d\u00a0 The switching of power sources envisaged by the EPA\u2019s plan also means the planning, design and creation of \u201cmajor backbone transmission lines where they do not currently exist.\u201d</p>", "<p>Nebraska gets about 50 percent of its electrical energy from coal, Bracht said, and under the earlier version of the EPA\u2019s rule, it was supposed to cut 26 per cent of its carbon emissions from 2012 levels. In the final rule that the states are not litigating, the total jumped to 40 per cent.</p>", "<p>And when it comes to shifting from coal to less carbon-emitting fuels like natural gas, he declared, \u201cthe coal-fired plant does not necessarily have a natural gas pipeline next to it for its replacement.\u201d\u00a0</p>", "<p>\u201cThere are very few people in the United States who don\u2019t expect the lights to work when they turn them on,\u201d he said. \u201cThe kind of disruption this shift implies might test that.\u201d</p>", "<p><i>George Russell is editor-at-large of Fox News and can be found on Twitter: \u00a0@GeorgeRussell or on Facebook.com/GeorgeRussell</i></p>"]}

The turn of events already threatens to deeply damage ties between the U.S. and Mexico. Attorney General Eric Holder has contacted his Mexican counterparts about the release, the Justice Department confirmed to FoxNews.com this week.\u00a0</p>", "<p>The case of Quintero, for U.S. agents, is personal. Quintero spent the last 28 years locked up for the 1985 kidnapping and killing of American DEA agent Enrique \u201cKiki\u201d Camarena. He was originally sentenced to spend 40 years behind bars.\u00a0</p>", "<p>Camarena was tortured before his execution, and the grisly details have not faded from the memories of his fellow former agents.\u00a0Camarena was viciously beaten, with his tormenters reportedly using a screwdriver to drill a hole in his head; a doctor was employed to keep him alive and conscious during the interrogation.\u00a0A detailed 1985 Miami Herald report on the kidnapping said Camarena suffered a broken jaw, a broken nose, broken cheekbones and a crushed windpipe.\u00a0</p>", "<p>Camarena's body was later discovered, along with that of his Mexican pilot, on a ranch outside Guadalajara.\u00a0</p>", "<p>\u201cTwenty-eight years is not long enough for someone who has captured, tortured for three days and murdered someone,\u201d a member of The Association of Former Federal Narcotics Agents told FoxNews.com. \u201cForty years isn\u2019t enough.

By the late 1980s, he had acquired the trappings of success: a Cadillac DeVille and a Lincoln Town Car, a lakefront home, investments in oil and real estate.</p>", "<p>Then the Nazi hunters showed up.</p>", "<p>In 1989, as the U.S. government prepared to strip him of his citizenship, Denzinger packed a pair of suitcases and fled to Germany. Denzinger later settled in this pleasant town on the Drava River, where he lives comfortably, courtesy of U.S. taxpayers. He collects a Social Security payment of about $1,500 each month, nearly twice the take-home pay of an average Croatian worker.</p>", "<p>Denzinger, 90, is among dozens of suspected Nazi war criminals and SS guards who collected millions of dollars in Social Security payments after being forced out of the United States, an Associated Press investigation found.</p>", "<p>The payments flowed through a legal loophole that has given the U.S. Justice Department leverage to persuade Nazi suspects to leave. If they agreed to go, or simply fled before deportation, they could keep their Social Security, according to interviews and internal government records.</p>", "<p>Like Denzinger, many lied about their Nazi pasts to get into the U.S. following World War II, and eventually became American citizens.</p>", "<p>Among those who benefited:</p>", "<p>--armed SS troops who guarded the Nazi network of camps where millions of Jews perished.</p>", "<p>--an SS guard who took part in the brutal liquidation of the Warsaw ghetto in Nazi-occupied Poland that killed as many as 13,000 Jews.</p>", "<p>--a Nazi collaborator who engineered the arrest and execution of thousands of Jews in Poland.</p>", "<p>--a German rocket scientist accused of using slave labor to build the V-2 rocket that pummeled London. He later won NASA's highest honor for helping to put a man on the moon.</p>", "<p>The AP's findings are the result of more than two years of interviews, research and analysis of records obtained through the Freedom of Information Act and other sources.</p>", "<p>The Justice Department denied using Social Security payments as a tool for removing Nazi suspects. But records show the U.S. State Department and the Social Security Administration voiced grave concerns over the methods used by the Justice Department's Nazi-hunting unit, the Office of Special Investigations.</p>", "<p>State officials derogatorily called the practice \"Nazi dumping\" and claimed the OSI was bargaining with suspects so they would leave voluntarily.</p>", "<p>Since 1979, the AP analysis found, at least 38 of 66 suspects removed from the United States kept their Social Security benefits.</p>", "<p>Legislation that would have closed the Social Security loophole failed 15 years ago, partly due to opposition from the OSI. Since then, according to the AP's analysis, at least 10 Nazi suspects kept their benefits after leaving. The Social Security Administration confirmed payments to seven who are deceased. One living suspect was confirmed through an AP interview. Two others met the conditions to keep their benefits.</p>", "<p>Of the 66 suspects, at least four are alive, living in Europe on U.S. Social Security.</p>", "<p>In newly uncovered Social Security Administration records, the AP found that by March 1999, 28 suspected Nazi criminals had collected $1.5 million in Social Security payments after their removal from the U.S.</p>", "<p>Since then, the AP estimates the amount paid out has reached into the millions. That estimate is based on the number of suspects who qualified and the three decades that have passed since the first former Nazis, Arthur Rudolph and John Avdzej, signed agreements that required them to leave the country but ensured their benefits would continue.</p>", "<p>Long-living beneficiaries can collect hundreds of thousands of dollars in payments.</p>", "<p>A single male who earned an average wage of $44,800 a year and turned 65 in 1990, the year after Denzinger did, would receive nearly $15,000 annually in Social Security benefits, according to the Urban Institute, a nonprofit public policy group in Washington. That's $375,000 over 25 years. The amounts are adjusted for inflation.</p>", "<p>The Social Security Administration refused the AP's request for the total number of Nazi suspects who received benefits and the dollar amounts of those payments.</p>", "<p>Spokesman William \"BJ\" Jarrett said the agency does not track data specific to Nazi cases. A further barrier, Jarrett said, is that there is no exception in U.S. privacy law that \"allows us to disclose information because the individual is a Nazi war criminal or an accused Nazi war criminal.\"</p>", "<p>The agency also declined to make the acting commissioner, Carolyn Colvin, or another senior agency official available for an interview.</p>", "<p>The Justice Department declined the AP's request for an official to speak on the record. Spokesman Peter Carr said in an emailed statement that Social Security payments never were used as an incentive or as a threat to persuade Nazi suspects to depart voluntarily.</p>", "<p>\"The matter of Social Security benefits eligibility was raised by defense counsel, not by the department, and the department neither used retirement benefits as an inducement to leave the country and renounce citizenship nor threatened that failure to depart and renounce would jeopardize continued receipt of benefits,\" Carr said.</p>", "<p>The department opposed the legislation in 1999, Carr acknowledged, because it would have undermined the OSI's mandate to remove Nazi criminals as expeditiously as possible to countries that would prosecute them.</p>", "<p>Speed was a key factor.</p>", "<p>Survivors of the Holocaust who made the United States their home after the war had been forced to share it with their former Nazi tormenters. That had to change, and fast, the OSI's proponents said. If suspects were to stand trial, they needed to be found and ousted while they were alive. The OSI and its backers didn't want death to cheat justice.</p>", "<p>Yet only 10 suspects were ever prosecuted after being expelled, according to the department's own figures.</p>", "<p>At his home in Osijek, Denzinger would not discuss his situation. \"I don't want to say anything,\" he told the AP in German as he rested on his walker in the hallway of his apartment.</p>", "<p>But Denzinger's son, who lives in the U.S., confirmed his father receives Social Security payments and said he deserved them. \"This isn't coming out of other people's pockets,\" Thomas Denzinger said. \"He paid into the system.\" Plus his father is paying 30 percent in taxes. \"They should be taking out nothing,\" he said.</p>", "<p>Another former Nazi camp guard, longtime Montana resident Martin Hartmann, lives in Berlin and also is collecting Social Security, according to a person with knowledge of Hartmann's finances who requested anonymity because the person did not want to be associated with Hartmann's Nazi history. Hartmann, 95, left the U.S. in 2007, just before a federal judge issued an order to revoke his citizenship.</p>", "<p>The loophole also means new suspects, including former SS unit commander Michael Karkoc, whom the AP located last year in Minnesota, could retain benefits even if removed to another country.</p>", "<p>German prosecutors opened an investigation after the AP uncovered documentation showing Karkoc, 95, ordered his unit to raze a Polish village during the war.

However, it is likely that the administration will ask the D.C. appeals court to first convene all 11 judges to re-hear that case.\u00a0</p>", "<p>White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest stressed Tuesday that different courts have reached different conclusions on the subsidy issue, and said the latest ruling against the subsidies \u201cdoes not have any practical impact\u201d at this point on the ability of people to get tax credits.\u00a0The White House later said the D.C. decision was \"undermined\" by the Fourth Circuit decision.\u00a0</p>", "<p>Still, the D.C. court ruling nevertheless strikes at the foundation of the law by challenging subsidies that millions of people obtained through the federally run exchange known as HealthCare.gov.\u00a0</p>", "<p>The suit maintained that the language in ObamaCare actually restricts subsidies to state-run exchanges -- of which there are only 14 -- and does not authorize them to be given in the 36 states that use the federally run system. \u00a0</p>", "<p>The court agreed.</p>", "<p>\u201cWe reach this conclusion, frankly, with reluctance. At least until states that wish to can set up Exchanges, our ruling will likely have significant consequences both for the millions\u00a0 of individuals receiving tax credits through federal Exchanges and for health insurance markets more broadly,\u201d the ruling stated. \u00a0</p>", "<p>The case, Halbig v. Burwell, is one of the first major legal challenges that cuts to the heart of the Affordable Care Act by going after the legality of massive federal subsidies and those who benefit from them.</p>", "<p>The decision said the law \"unambiguously restricts\" the subsidies to insurance bought on state-run exchanges.\u00a0</p>", "<p>The dissenting opinion, though, claimed political motivations were at play. \u201cThis case is about Appellants\u2019 not-so-veiled attempt to gut the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ('ACA'),\u201d the dissent stated.\u00a0</p>", "<p>The ruling, though likely to be appealed, could threaten the entire foundation of the newly devised health care system.

If they agreed to go, or simply fled before deportation, they could keep their Social Security, according to interviews and internal government records.</p>", "<p>Like Denzinger, many lied about their Nazi pasts to get into the U.S. following World War II, and eventually became American citizens.</p>", "<p>Among those who benefited:</p>", "<p>--armed SS troops who guarded the Nazi network of camps where millions of Jews perished.</p>", "<p>--an SS guard who took part in the brutal liquidation of the Warsaw ghetto in Nazi-occupied Poland that killed as many as 13,000 Jews.</p>", "<p>--a Nazi collaborator who engineered the arrest and execution of thousands of Jews in Poland.</p>", "<p>--a German rocket scientist accused of using slave labor to build the V-2 rocket that pummeled London.

Two others met the conditions to keep their benefits.</p>", "<p>Of the 66 suspects, at least four are alive, living in Europe on U.S. Social Security.</p>", "<p>In newly uncovered Social Security Administration records, the AP found that by March 1999, 28 suspected Nazi criminals had collected $1.5 million in Social Security payments after their removal from the U.S.</p>", "<p>Since then, the AP estimates the amount paid out has reached into the millions.

Morell is accused of heavily editing the so-called \"talking points,\" which were the basis for then-U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice's controversial comments on several Sunday shows after the attacks that also blamed a protest.\u00a0</p>", "<p>Morell, speaking before the House Intelligence Committee, insisted Wednesday he did not \"deliberately\" downplay the role of terrorists in that attack. He also said he never knew Rice was going to appear on the Sunday shows the weekend after the attack.\u00a0</p>", "<p>But he did confirm that he overruled guidance from the CIA chief of station in Libya that the attacks were \"not/not an escalation of protests.\"\u00a0</p>", "<p>Morell, explaining his decision, effectively challenged the evidence his chief of station brought to the table in his message, sent via email a few days after the attack. He said the claim that there was no protest was based only on \"press reports\" and reports from officers who arrived in Benghazi after the attack had already started.\u00a0</p>", "<p>He said that basis was not \"compelling\" enough.\u00a0</p>", "<p>Still, Morell explained that when he received the email from the CIA chief of station, he recognized the \"discrepancy\" between what he was saying and what other analysts were saying. He said he quickly had his analysts \"revisit their judgment\" that a protest was underway -- but \"based on a totality of the information available to them, they stuck with their initial conclusions.\"\u00a0</p>", "<p>The testimony was met with skepticism in some corners.

They did not mention that Al Qaeda-linked terrorists were involved in the attacks, though briefings and intelligence reports assessed they were involved,\" Rogers said. \"The talking points suggested that there had been a demonstration ... when there had been none and the officers on the ground said so.\"\u00a0</p>", "<p>He continued: \"I must conclude that the White House used your talking points to [perpetuate] its own misguided political agenda.\u00a0</p>", "<p>\"I believe that the White House wanted America to believe Al Qaeda to be on the run, and thus they needed the attacks to be in response to an anti-Islamic video. And so the White House used your talking points to say so.\"\u00a0</p>", "<p>Morell, though, said nobody at the CIA \"deliberately misled\" Congress about the attack.\u00a0</p>", "<p>\"We did not deliberately downplay the role of terrorists in the Benghazi attack,\" he testified before the House Intelligence Committee, in a rare open session.\u00a0</p>", "<p>He said the suggestion that he made edits for the political benefit of the administration is \"false.\" And he explained that, from the start, he considered the attack to have been both a protest and a terrorist attack.\u00a0</p>", "<p>After the hearing ended, some lawmakers continued to raise questions about Morell's testimony -- and particularly the decision to ignore the chief of station's guidance.\u00a0</p>", "<p>\"What is most troubling is that the CIA Chief of Station in Libya repeatedly informed Washington that no demonstration ever occurred in Benghazi on the day of the attack, and that his views were consistently disregarded and overruled by CIA officials in Washington, including Mr. Morell,\" said a statement from Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz.; Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.; and Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H. \"The Chief of Station was the agency's senior leader on the ground during the terrorist attack in Benghazi, so it is unfathomable why his views were not taken more seriously.\"\u00a0</p>", "<p>In another curious moment during the hearing, Morell claimed he deleted references to terrorism warnings from the talking points to avoid the spy agency's gloating at the expense of the State Department.\u00a0</p>", "<p>Morell said the CIA knew that some of the individuals involved in the attack were Al Qaeda from classified sources, information that couldn't be included unless it was declassified. The talking points were provided to members of the committee for dissemination to the American people.\u00a0</p>", "<p>Morell said he removed references to the warnings based on previous CIA analysis. Otherwise, he said, the talking points would have been a \"way for CIA to pound its chest and say `we warned,' laying all the blame on the State Department.\"\u00a0</p>", "<p>Morell said there would be plenty of time later on to figure out what went wrong.\u00a0</p>", "<p>The former CIA boss also fielded questions about Beacon Global Strategies, the firm he later went to work for, and Washington's revolving door.

Mitch McConnell last year, was declared the winner over state Attorney General Conway in the gubernatorial race shortly after polls closed Tuesday evening.\u00a0</p>", "<p>Independent Drew Curtis was a distant third in Tuesday's election.</p>", "<p>\u200eThe office is currently held by a Democrat.\u00a0Bevin's election gives Republicans control of the state's executive branch along with a commanding majority in the state Senate. Democrats still have an eight-seat majority in the state House of Representatives.</p>", "<p>Throughout his campaign, Bevin cast himself as an outsider, in both government and politics. The 48-year-old investment manager has never held public office and was shunned by the state's Republican political establishment when he challenged McConnell in the 2014 Senate primary. He never took any meaningful steps to repair those relationships after the race, often deflecting assistance from party officials and likely affecting his fundraising ability.</p>", "<p>He relied more on the details of his personal story \u2014 his Christian faith and his four adopted children from Ethiopia \u2014 than his political policies.</p>", "<p>\"This is the chance for a fresh start, it truly is, and we really need it,\" Bevin told a packed crowd at The Galt House in Louisville. \"I believe this offers us an opportunity to change the tenor of what has become expected in the world of politics.\"</p>", "<p>Bevin's campaign was mostly self-funded, and he preferred to speak to small gatherings of voters instead of courting influential donors. His running mate, Jenean Hampton, is a retired Air Force officer who moved to Kentucky from Detroit and whose only political experience is a lopsided loss to the former speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives in 2014. Now, Hampton will become the first black person to ever hold statewide office in Kentucky.</p>", "<p>Conway conceded the race shortly before 9 p.m. at the Frankfort Convention Center, telling the quiet crowd it was not the result he had hoped for, \"but it is the result we respect.\" He said he called Bevin and wished him well.</p>", "<p>\"It was a cordial phone call. I told him I remain positive about moving this state forward, and if he ever needed any assistance, this Democrat was at his disposal,\" Conway said.</p>", "<p>Bevin ran an aggressive campaign, often arguing with reporters and even dropping by the state Democratic Party headquarters, twice, to argue with them about their signs criticizing him as dishonest. But it appeared Bevin was able to tap into voters' growing frustration with their government to overcome any concerns they may have had about his temperament. He has promised some sweeping changes, most notably repealing the state's expanded Medicaid program and kynect, the state-run health insurance exchange. Those decisions will affect the health insurance of about a half-million people.</p>", "<p>Focus will almost immediately shift to the state House elections in 2016, where McConnell has vowed to flex his powerful fundraising muscle to help Republicans to take over the only Southern state legislative body controlled by Democrats.</p>", "<p>The results Tuesday were also a potentially troubling sign for Democrats ahead of next year's presidential election.</p>", "<p>Bevin waged a campaign to scale back the state's Medicaid expansion that was made possible by President Obama's health care overhaul. He also played up his support of Kim Davis, the Rowan County clerk jailed for refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.</p>", "<p><i>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</i></p>"]}

As of early Wednesday morning, Hennessy had received 62 percent of the vote to just 31 percent for Mirkarimi.\u00a0</p>", "<p>Mirkarimi was the subject of national criticism after Mexican illegal immigrant Francisco Sanchez allegedly shot and killed 32-year-old Kate Steinle on San Francisco's waterfront July 1. Sanchez had been released from Mirkarimi's jail in March even though federal immigration officials had requested he be detained for possible deportation.\u00a0</p>", "<p>But since then, the sheriff's oversight of the department has been plagued by other high-profile mishaps and controversies seen as contributing to his defeat. He had his driver's license briefly suspended for failing to properly report a minor accident while driving a department-issued car, and he also flunked a marksmanship test.\u00a0</p>", "<p>Before those two incidents, a drug gang leader escaped from jail, and guards were accused of staging and gambling on inmate fights.\u00a0</p>", "<p>In November 2014, Mirkarimi also was forced to apologize for the bungled search for a San Francisco General Hospital patient whose body was found in a stairwell weeks after she wandered from her room. The sheriff is in charge of the hospital's security, but deputies didn't search the building until nine days after her disappearance. The city paid the patient's family $3 million to settle a lawsuit.\u00a0</p>", "<p>But Mirkarimi is now known nationally for his strident defense of sanctuary city policies, taking the practice to a new level under his leadership.\u00a0</p>", "<p>San Francisco declared itself a sanctuary city in 1989, passing an ordinance that bans city officials from enforcing immigration laws or asking about immigration status unless required by law or court order. A follow-up ordinance in 2013 allows detention only under a court order targeting violent felons. Last month, San Francisco's board of supervisors unanimously approved a resolution to maintain the city's sanctuary status.\u00a0</p>", "<p>San Francisco and other cities and counties have routinely ignored requests from Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials to keep people in custody. The jurisdictions say they can't hold arrestees beyond their scheduled release dates without probable cause.\u00a0</p>", "<p>Hennessy has previously said the sheriff's order barring the San Francisco jail from cooperating with immigration officials is misguided. There are cases, she said, when federal immigration officials should be notified that the jail is about to release an inmate who is in the country illegally.\u00a0</p>", "<p><i>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</i></p>"]}

An education policy group with ties to one of the state's Republican mega-donors mailed advertisements attacking Courser and Gamrat for misusing public resources to cover up the affair.</p>", "<p>In May, Courser sent a sexually explicit phony email to GOP activists and reporters that said he had been caught having sex with a male prostitute behind a Lansing nightclub. The self-smear email called Courser a \"bi-sexual porn addicted sex deviant\" and \"gun toting Bible thumping ... freak\" and Gamrat a \"tramp.\"</p>", "<p>Courser explained that he thought his tale would make the affair less plausible in case it was revealed by an anonymous extortionist who sent him and Gamrat text messages demanding that he resign.</p>", "<p>After the scandal broke in August, the freshmen legislators asked to be censured.

His supporters credit his leadership for a time of lower taxes, safer neighborhoods and cleaner parks.</p>", "<p>Ganim, 56, entered the election as the endorsed candidate of the hard-luck city's most powerful party after defeating two-term incumbent Mayor Bill Finch in the primary.

We must continue to make progress in Bridgeport,\" Malloy said.</p>", "<p>Some of Ganim's strongest competition came from Mary Jane Foster, an administrator at the University of Bridgeport who petitioned her way onto the ballot after losing in the Democratic primary. Foster, who had been endorsed by Finch and the city's largest newspaper, said the city of 150,000 people is still battling a reputation for corruption earned by Ganim's criminal conviction.</p>", "<p>Ganim was sent to prison for steering city contracts in exchange for hundreds of thousands of dollars in expensive wine, custom clothes, cash and home improvements. Since his release, he has worked as a legal assistant at his family's Bridgeport law firm, but he has been blocked by the courts from regaining his law license.</p>", "<p>Ganim issued a public apology for his crimes earlier this year.

He said he quickly had his analysts \"revisit their judgment\" that a protest was underway -- but \"based on a totality of the information available to them, they stuck with their initial conclusions.\"\u00a0</p>", "<p>The testimony was met with skepticism in some corners.

John McCain, R-Ariz.; Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.; and Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H. \"The Chief of Station was the agency's senior leader on the ground during the terrorist attack in Benghazi, so it is unfathomable why his views were not taken more seriously.\"\u00a0</p>", "<p>In another curious moment during the hearing, Morell claimed he deleted references to terrorism warnings from the talking points to avoid the spy agency's gloating at the expense of the State Department.\u00a0</p>", "<p>Morell said the CIA knew that some of the individuals involved in the attack were Al Qaeda from classified sources, information that couldn't be included unless it was declassified. The talking points were provided to members of the committee for dissemination to the American people.\u00a0</p>", "<p>Morell said he removed references to the warnings based on previous CIA analysis. Otherwise, he said, the talking points would have been a \"way for CIA to pound its chest and say `we warned,' laying all the blame on the State Department.\"\u00a0</p>", "<p>Morell said there would be plenty of time later on to figure out what went wrong.\u00a0</p>", "<p>The former CIA boss also fielded questions about Beacon Global Strategies, the firm he later went to work for, and Washington's revolving door.

The diplomatic crisis erupted after Saudi Arabia went forward with a mass execution which included the killing of a prominent Shia cleric, and Iranians retaliated by storming the Saudi embassy in Tehran.\u00a0</p>", "<p>Saudi Arabia's response, though, reflected not only its outrage at Iran but an undercurrent of frustration with the United States\u2019 reluctance to hold Iran accountable for alleged aggressions.

He had his driver's license briefly suspended for failing to properly report a minor accident while driving a department-issued car, and he also flunked a marksmanship test.\u00a0</p>", "<p>Before those two incidents, a drug gang leader escaped from jail, and guards were accused of staging and gambling on inmate fights.\u00a0</p>", "<p>In November 2014, Mirkarimi also was forced to apologize for the bungled search for a San Francisco General Hospital patient whose body was found in a stairwell weeks after she wandered from her room. The sheriff is in charge of the hospital's security, but deputies didn't search the building until nine days after her disappearance. The city paid the patient's family $3 million to settle a lawsuit.\u00a0</p>", "<p>But Mirkarimi is now known nationally for his strident defense of sanctuary city policies, taking the practice to a new level under his leadership.\u00a0</p>", "<p>San Francisco declared itself a sanctuary city in 1989, passing an ordinance that bans city officials from enforcing immigration laws or asking about immigration status unless required by law or court order. A follow-up ordinance in 2013 allows detention only under a court order targeting violent felons. Last month, San Francisco's board of supervisors unanimously approved a resolution to maintain the city's sanctuary status.\u00a0</p>", "<p>San Francisco and other cities and counties have routinely ignored requests from Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials to keep people in custody. The jurisdictions say they can't hold arrestees beyond their scheduled release dates without probable cause.\u00a0</p>", "<p>Hennessy has previously said the sheriff's order barring the San Francisco jail from cooperating with immigration officials is misguided.

He served as Florida governor from 2007 until 2011 and was mentioned as a possible vice presidential pick in 2008. Many believed he had an eye on eventually running for president.</p>", "<p>But his career came to a screeching halt when he decided to run for U.S. Senate instead of seeking a second term as governor. He began the campaign as the heavy favorite to win, but then Marco Rubio began using images of Crist hugging President Barack Obama. Republican support for Crist dwindled. Crist ended up dropping out of the primary and running as an independent. He lost to Rubio, who is now running for president.</p>", "<p>Crist eventually registered as a Democrat and campaigned for Obama in 2012. Last year, he ran against Gov. Rick Scott, losing the close race after Scott spent almost $13 million of his own money in the final week of the election to saturate Florida with television commercials.</p>", "<p>Crist is hoping new congressional districts ordered by the Florida Supreme Court will give him a good chance to win. The map awaiting the court's approval puts all of St. Petersburg in the same district, making it more enticing for Crist, who grew up in the city and still lives downtown. The new district is also expected to have more Democratic voters.</p>", "<p>The seat is now held by Republican Rep. David Jolly, who is running for Rubio's seat in part because it was clear the new district would favor Democrats.</p>", "<p>While many in the Republican Party despise Crist because he switched parties, at least one from Crist's home county of Pinellas believes he'd make a good congressman.</p>", "<p>\"Some people are better suited in the legislative branch than the executive, and he's one of them,\" said Tony DiMatteo, who used to serve on the state GOP executive board. \"He's a natural fit for the United States Congress.\"</p>", "<p>Still, most Republicans are likely to repeat their attacks on Crist from his last two election losses.

However, Democratic Gov. Steve Beshear has refused to call a special session, saying it would be a waste of money being that the controversy only surrounds one clerk.</p>", "<p>\"The Supreme Court ruling has completely obliterated the definition of marriage and the process for obtaining a marriage license in Kentucky,\" Stivers said in a news release. \"The General Assembly will be compelled to amend many sections of Kentucky law, not just for the issuance of marriage licenses, to comply with the recent Supreme Court decision.\"</p>", "<p>Nearly all of Kentucky\u2019s laws governing marriage are invalid following the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark ruling in June that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide, Stivers said. For example, Kentucky\u2019s state law requires a couple seeking a marriage license to apply for one in the county \u201cin which the female resides\u201d or in another county so long as the woman applies for it.</p>", "<p>\"(The Supreme Court decision) clearly contemplates marriages that do not involve a female, as well as marriages that involve two females,\" Stivers' attorney wrote to the court. \"It is unclear at this juncture what the proper venue for the issuance of a license for same sex marriages is after (the Supreme Court's decision.)</p>", "<p>Davis has been embroiled in controversy after refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples over religious reasons. She stopped issuing marriage licenses after the Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. Two gay couples and two straight couples sued her, and Bunning had ordered her to issue the licenses.</p>", "<p>However, Davis has refused to obey the order, even though it was upheld in the Supreme Court on Tuesday. The couples named in the lawsuit have urged Bunning to punish Davis by imposing fines against her. Bunning said he will decide that after a court hearing on Thursday, at which Davis is expected to testify.</p>", "<p>An attorney for Davis argued on Wednesday that Bunning shouldn\u2019t punish her for disobeying his order because she\u2019s unable to follow it. Jonathan Christman wrote that if Davis were to issue a marriage license to a same-sex couple it would \"irreparably and irreversibly violate her conscience.\" Christman said Davis cannot separate herself from her religious beliefs even while she is an elected official.</p>", "<p>\"It is not as if Kim Davis the individual stops existing while Kim Davis is performing her duties as Rowan County clerk,\" Christman wrote.</p>", "<p>Christman argued Davis should not be punished yet because she still has an appeal pending before a higher court on a related issue. He also said that if Bunning were to fine Davis for not obeying his order it would amount to criminal penalties that would be illegal because Davis has not exercised all of her rights, including the right to a trial by a jury.</p>", "<p>Attorneys for the couples suing Davis have said she should be fined because she continues to earn a taxpayer-funded salary \"for duties she fails to perform.\"</p>", "<p><i>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</i></p>"]}

Williams was seeking state university research on his company's signature anti-inflammatory product.</p>", "<p>The Obama administration urged the court to reject the appeal, saying the jury had ample evidence of bribery.</p>", "<p>But Republicans and Democrats who once worked in the Justice Department and White House joined McDonnell in contending that the overly broad definition of bribery on which he was convicted would make a crime of routine actions by elected officials on behalf of their constituents.</p>", "<p>The case probably will be argued in April and decided by the end of June.</p>", "<p>The justices have taken on several cases in recent years that claimed prosecutors were too aggressive in their pursuit of white-collar crimes. In 2010, the court narrowed the use of an anti-fraud law that was central in convicting politicians and corporate executives in many of the nation's most prominent corruption cases.</p>", "<p>Last year, the justices also declined to hear the government's appeal of a lower court ruling that threw out insider trading convictions.</p>", "<p>McDonnell's was among eight new cases the justices agreed to hear Friday. Others include:</p>", "<p>-- A Missouri church's challenge to its exclusion from a state program that provides money to use ground-up tires to cushion playgrounds.</p>", "<p>-- A dispute about whether a board created to review patents by a 2011 law is jeopardizing innovation by using a standard that favors challenges to patents and invalidating too many patents.</p>", "<p>-- An appeal from Microsoft Corp. over a class-action lawsuit by disgruntled owners of the Xbox 360 video-game system who claim the console has a design defect that scratches game disks.</p>", "<p>-- A bid by service advisers at auto dealerships who say they are entitled to overtime pay under federal labor laws.</p>", "<p>The action in McDonnell's case was not a surprise because the justices voted in August to allow McDonnell to postpone the start of his two-year prison term while his appeal was being considered. Such votes typically signal the court will hear the full appeal.</p>", "<p>The court will not take up a second issue raised by McDonnell: whether the trial judge did enough to ensure that jurors could be impartial in spite of the heavy news coverage of the McDonnells' cases in Virginia news outlets.</p>", "<p>Maureen McDonnell was sentenced to a year and a day in prison. Her appeal has been put on hold until the Supreme Court decides her husband's case.</p>", "<p>The heart of the former governor's appeal is that he never took official action to benefit Williams or the Star Scientific company he ran. Neither Williams nor the company received any state money and McDonnell never pressured anyone to help Williams or promised Williams that he would, McDonnell argues in his appeal.</p>", "<p>But Solicitor General Donald Verrilli Jr. said McDonnell violated federal anti-corruption law when he accepted \"personal benefits in exchange for his agreement to influence government matters.\"</p>", "<p>The case is McDonnell v.

The listing of salmon and sucker fish under the Endangered Species Act in the 1990s touched off years of fighting over water rights, and anger boiled over in 2001 when the feds shut off water to farmers in the region, in a bid to help endangered fish.\u00a0</p>", "<p>Thousands protested, and the dispute appeared intractable. Court rulings and state government decisions on water rights only seemed to further muddy the waters.</p>", "<p>Then something remarkable happened \u2013 a compromise. Indian tribes, irrigators, environmentalists, power company PacifiCorp, and local and federal officials eventually hammered out what\u2019s known as the Klamath Basin Restoration Agreement (KBRA) in 2010.\u00a0</p>", "<p>The deal, at its core, set rules for sharing the water. And while it didn\u2019t guarantee farmers all the water they want, especially in drought years, it did give them more certainty.</p>", "<p>The Klamath and Karuk Tribes, which were granted senior water rights based on old treaties, agreed to take less water than they\u2019re entitled to for the endangered sucker fish in exchange for extensive restoration of the Klamath River. \u00a0</p>", "<p>But here\u2019s the rub: the centerpiece of that restoration has become so controversial in Congress it may send the KBRA down the drain.</p>", "<p>\u201cI never could have imagined that a bipartisan, locally driven solution to one of the most challenging natural resources in the country would fail to see congressional action,\u201d said Chrysten Lambert of Trout Unlimited.\u00a0</p>", "<p>Critics of the deal, though, have real concerns. That\u2019s because the KBRA calls for the removal of four hydroelectric dams on the Klamath River.</p>", "<p>All told, the dams are 400 feet high and can produce 145 megawatts of carbon-free power \u2013 and taking them offline would make this the largest dam removal project in U.S. history, far exceeding the removal of the 210-foot Elwha Dam in Washington state in 2012.\u00a0</p>", "<p>Amid these concerns, Congress has not yet approved the KBRA -- and the deadline for congressional action is Dec. 31.\u00a0</p>", "<p>Oregon\u2019s lone Republican member of Congress, Greg Walden, wrote a bill that would give 100,000 acres of federal forest land to local counties to be managed for timber revenue. The legislation is designed to compensate Siskiyou County in California and Klamath County in Oregon for the loss of tax revenue from the dams.\u00a0</p>", "<p>Yet Walden\u2019s bill does not specifically mention dam removal. \u00a0</p>", "<p>He told Fox News taking out the Klamath dams would set a dangerous precedent.</p>", "<p>\u201cWhen all this started, some of the environmental groups said, \u2018if we can do it here, we can do it on the Snake River and then, you know, on to Moscow,\u2019\u201d Walden said.\u00a0</p>", "<p>Several parties say if the KBRA is not approved by Congress, they will back out of the deal and take their chances in court as they challenge the federal re-licensing of the dams. \u00a0</p>", "<p>Don Gentry, vice chairman of the Klamath Tribe, had an ominous warning for farmers.</p>", "<p>\u201cAll the gloves come off,\u201d Gentry said, \u201cYes, there will definitely be shut offs to the agriculture community.\u201d</p>", "<p>It\u2019s exactly the scenario long-time potato grower Bill Walker feared, even though he admits that for years he opposed the dam removal. Yet he now fears the uncertainty of no deal at all.\u00a0</p>", "<p>\u201cWe know it\u2019s going to be a rougher road,\u201d Walker said. \u201cWe just don\u2019t know how rough it\u2019s going to be.\u201d</p>", "<p>Greg Addington, director of the Klamath Water User\u2019s Association, blames partisan politics in Congress. \u201cWe did the hard work, we handed it to them,\u201d Addington said. \u201cSo it\u2019s frustrating, we need them to do what we did. They need to get in a room, shut the door and work this thing out right now.\u201d</p>", "<p>Oregon\u2019s two Democratic senators, Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley, support the KBRA and the dam removal provision.\u00a0</p>", "<p>They have a bill stamping the KBRA\u2019s approval, but it has never passed the full Senate.\u00a0</p>", "<p>\u201cTime is running out and it\u2019s urgent that Congress also set aside its differences and act to make local stakeholders\u2019 vision a reality,\u201d they said in a joint statement.</p>", "<p>PacifiCorp, which owns all four dams in question, also supports the dam removal plan because it would limit the company\u2019s liability during the removal process.</p>", "<p>The company issued a statement last week when Congress went on recess without approving the KBRA: \u201cWe share the concern of many settlement parties that continued inaction could fracture the broad coalition that has chosen compromise over counterproductive confrontation and litigation on these difficult issues.\u201d\u00a0</p>", "<p>Yet many county commissioners oppose the dam removal. For some, like Tom Mallams who chairs the Klamath County Board of Commissioners, dams are viewed as symbols of progress.</p>", "<p>\u201cIt holds something for a lot of people,\u201d Mallams said. \u201cIt shows a significant amount of taming the West, taming the rivers, using our natural resources for the betterment of mankind, not just for fish.\u201d</p>", "<p>Environmental groups and tribes disagree. They point to salmon runs that were stopped in 1917 when the first dam on the Klamath was built. They also argue that the four Klamath dams in question are not used to store water for farm irrigation, are not used for flood control and produce a relatively small amount of electricity.\u00a0</p>", "<p>According to PacifiCorp, the four dams account for about 2 percent of its capacity, enough to power 70,000 households.\u00a0</p>", "<p>Dan Springer joined Fox News Channel (FNC) in August 2001 as a Seattle-based correspondent.</p>"]}

A Planned Parenthood lawyer, Beth Parker, declined to estimate how much money would be sought, but it said the amount would include extra money spent since the videos' release on additional security for Planned Parenthood clinics.</p>", "<p>David Daleiden, a founder of the Center for Medical Progress who oversaw the video operation, said he looked forward to confronting Planned Parenthood officials in court.</p>", "<p>\"My response is: Game on,\" he said in an email. \"I look forward to deposing all the CEOs, medical directors, and their co-conspirators who participated in Planned Parenthood's illegal baby body parts racket.\"</p>", "<p>The lawsuit alleges that Daleiden and several collaborators, including longtime anti-abortion activist Troy Newman, \"engaged in a complex criminal enterprise to defraud Planned Parenthood.\" The suit contends that the Center for Medical Progress violated the Racketeer Influence and Corrupt Organization Act (known as the RICO Act), engaging in wire fraud, mail fraud, invasion of privacy, illegal secret recording and trespassing.</p>", "<p>According to the suit, Daleiden, Newman and other defendants used aliases, obtained fake government IDs and formed a fake tissue procurement company, Biomax, in order to gain access to private medical conferences and health care centers, and to tape private professional conversations of medical providers.</p>", "<p>The videos provoked an outcry from the anti-abortion movement, and prompted numerous investigations of Planned Parenthood by Republican-led committees in Congress and by GOP-led state governments. Thus far, none of the investigations has turned up wrongdoing by Planned Parenthood in regard to fetal tissue research, but Republicans in Congress and in several states are seeking to cut off government funding to the organization.</p>", "<p>The videos created a \"poisonous environment\" in which Planned Parenthood staffers were targeted with hate mail and death threats, said Parker, the organization's lawyer. She cited the attack in November on a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado in which three people were killed; the man arrested in the shooting depicted himself in court as a \"warrior for the babies.\"</p>"]}

The bill now goes to the White House for President Barack Obama's signature.</p>", "<p>The bill boosts highway and transit spending and assures states that federal help will be available for major projects. It doesn't include as much money or last quite as long as many lawmakers and the Obama administration would have liked. Nor does it resolve how to pay for transportation programs in the long term.</p>", "<p>Despite that, the 1,300-page bill was hailed by industry and public officials as a major accomplishment that will halt the cycle of last-minute short-term fixes that have kept the federal Highway Trust Fund teetering on the edge of insolvency for much of the past eight years.</p>", "<p>Republicans leaders can point to the bill's passage as evidence of their ability to govern, and Obama can claim progress on addressing the nation's aging and congested infrastructure, a major goal since the early days of his administration. Lawmakers in both parties praised the bill as a model of bipartisan cooperation and an important step forward.</p>", "<p>The bill \"proves to the American people that we can get big things done,\" said Rep. Bill Shuster, chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. The committee's senior Democrat, Rep. Peter DeFazio of Oregon, called the measure \"historic,\" but cautioned that \"it is a starting point, not the end.\"</p>", "<p>One hallmark of the bill is the creation of new programs to focus federal aid on eliminating bottlenecks and increasing the capacity of highways designated as major freight corridors. The Transportation Department estimates the volume of freight traffic will increase 45 percent over the next 30 years.</p>", "<p>A big shortcoming in the bill, though, is how it's all financed. The main source of revenue for transportation is the trust fund, which comes mostly from the 18.4-cents-a-gallon gasoline tax. That tax hasn't been raised since 1993 even though transportation spending has increased. But raising the gas tax is viewed by many lawmakers as too politically risky.</p>", "<p>To make up the shortfall, the bill uses about $70 billion in mostly budget gimmicks, including one that would move $53 billion from the Federal Reserve Bank's capital account to the general treasury. It's counted as new money on paper, but is actually just a transfer of funds from one government account to another, federal budget experts said.</p>", "<p>Other items in the bill also don't include the means to pay for them, including more than $10 billion over five years for Amtrak and other rail programs, $12 billion for mass transit and $1 billion for vehicle safety programs. The money for those programs remains subject to annual spending decisions by Congress.</p>", "<p>Among the bill's losers are large banks, which would receive lower dividends from the Federal Reserve, with the savings used for transportation programs. Banking officials complained that banks shouldn't be asked to foot the bill for highways and bridges.</p>", "<p>The airline and cruise ship industries complained that their passengers are also being asked to pay for improvements unrelated to their travel. The bill ties customs fees to inflation and uses the increased revenue to offset the bill's cost. It also directs the sale of 66 millions of barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in order to raise $6.5 billion. The catch is the sales don't start until 2023 \u2014 three years after the transportation bill it helps pay for has expired.</p>", "<p>The trucking industry was able to persuade lawmakers to order the government to remove trucking company safety scores from a public website despite opposition from safety advocates. Industry officials say the government's methodology is unfair. But safety advocates won inclusion of a long-sought provision requiring rental car agencies to repair recalled cars and trucks before renting them.</p>", "<p>The bill also addresses several concerns raised by a deadly Amtrak derailment in Philadelphia in May. It provides $200 million to help passenger railroads install positive train control technology that accident investigators say could have prevent the derailment had it been in operation. It also raises the liability cap on total damages that can be awarded in such crashes from $200 million to $295 million. The derailment killed eight people and injured nearly 200 others.</p>", "<p>The Amalgamated Transit Union, which represents city bus drivers, won a provision requiring the government to direct transit agencies to take steps to protect bus drivers from assault, a growing problem. The Federal Transit Administration is required to consider whether local transit agencies provide bathroom breaks and access to bathrooms for bus drivers when evaluating the safety of the agencies.</p>", "<p>A provision sponsored by Rep. Dina Titus, a Nevada Democrat whose district includes Las Vegas, authorizes the creation of a national advisory committee made up of travel and tourism industry officials to develop a national strategy for ensuring that transportation policies address the needs of travelers. Another provision sought by the dairy industry and sponsored by upstate New York, Connecticut and Wisconsin allows trucks hauling milk to exceed federal weight limits for interstate highways in some cases.</p>"]}

Herbert called the move \u201ca foolish crusade\u201d that strips America of one of its \u201cdiverse mix of energy sources.\u201d</p>", "<p>\"Another day, another front on the war on coal from this administration,\u201d she said in a statement following the announcement. \u201cAt this point, it is obvious that the president and his administration won't be satisfied until coal is completely eradicated from our energy mix.\u201d</p>", "<p>Roughly 40 percent of the coal produced in the United States comes from federal lands. The vast majority of that mining takes place in Wyoming, Montana, Colorado, Utah and New Mexico.</p>", "<p>It's unclear what impact the moratorium will have on many coal companies given the declining domestic demand for coal and the closure of numerous coal-fired power plants around the country. Coal companies have already stockpiled billions of tons of coal on existing leases.</p>", "<p>But the announcement will no doubt please environmental groups that have long said the government's fee rates encouraged production of a product that contributed to global warming.</p>", "<p>Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called Friday's announcement the \"latest front in an ideological war on coal that has contributed to devastation in communities in Eastern Kentucky and to the loss of thousands of jobs across the commonwealth.\" </p>", "<p>The administration held a handful of public hearings last year to get feedback on the adequacy of the fees charged companies for coal mined on federal lands. The government collects a 12.5 percent royalty on the sale price of strip-mined coal. The rate was established in 1976. The money is then split between the federal government and the state where the coal was mined. Coal companies also pay a $3 fee annually for each acre of land leased.</p>", "<p>Government auditors have in the past questioned whether the rate provided an appropriate return, though they did not make specific recommendations to raise it. Industry groups counter that any increase in royalty rates will hurt consumers and threaten high-paying jobs.</p>", "<p>President Obama said during the State of the Union address Tuesday that he would push to change the way the federal government manages its oil and coal resources.\u00a0</p>", "<p>The review will look at such issues as how, when and where to lease, how to account for the public health impacts of coal, and how to ensure American taxpayers earn a fair return on their resources. \u00a0An administration official noted that reviews of the federal coal program have occurred twice before, once in the 1970s and again in the 1980s, and pauses on the approval of new mining leases accompanied each review.</p>", "<p>Jewell said some exceptions to the moratorium will be allowed, most notably for small lease modifications. And while the federal government will proceed with environmental reviews for pending lease applications, no final decision will be made.</p>", "<p>The administration held hearings in Montana, Wyoming, Colorado and New Mexico last year on the federal coal program. Several people representing tribes, local ranchers and environmental groups spoke in favor of increasing royalty rates, saying it would hasten the transition to cleaner energy sources.</p>", "<p>Several GOP lawmakers sent staff to relay their concerns about the Interior Department's efforts.</p>", "<p>For example, Penny Pew, a district director for Republican Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona, said that \"President Obama and his agency minions are trying to put the coal industry out of business by imposing a flurry of draconian mandates not based in reality.\"</p>", "<p>Industry officials also voiced concerns.</p>", "<p>Meanwhile, David J. Hayes, a senior fellow at the liberal-leaning Center for American Progress, said Thursday the current rules for coal mining on federal lands were written when people could still smoke on planes and dump sewage in the ocean.</p>", "<p>\"President Obama and (Interior) Secretary (Sally) Jewell are absolutely right to launch this comprehensive review and to set the federal coal program in a more fiscally and environmentally responsible direction,\" Hayes said.</p>", "<p><i>The Associated Press contributed to this report.\u00a0</i></p>"]}

Matt Bevin notified federal officials in a letter dated Dec. 30 that the state exchange will cease operations \"as soon as is practicable.\" That will be at least a year from now, according to federal law. It will not affect health plans sold for 2016.</p>", "<p>Kentucky is one of 14 states that run their own state health insurance exchanges.

The system is paid for with a 1 percent tax on all individual health plans sold in the state, both on and off the exchange. Right now, Bevin says about 85,000 people have purchased a private health insurance plan through kynect, or about 2 percent of the population.</p>", "<p>Bevin spokeswoman Jessica Ditto said the fees from the sale of plans on kynect generate between $2.5 million and $4 million of the approximately $27 million it takes to operate the exchange each year.</p>", "<p>\"A majority of Kentuckians are paying a 1 percent assessment on their own premiums to support kynect operations which they do not use,\" Ditto said.</p>", "<p>Once Kentucky moves to the federal exchange, that tax goes up to 3.5 percent.

Former Democratic Gov. Steve Beshear created it with the help of about $290 million in federal grants. He has estimated it will take at least nine months and cost $23 million to dismantle the system.</p>", "<p>\"Kentucky's State-based Marketplace has helped tens of thousands of Kentuckians shop for and purchase quality, affordable health insurance,\" said Ben Wakana, a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. \"A successful transition from Kynect to the federal Marketplace will require strong cooperation and commitment from the state of Kentucky to its residents who have gained health insurance under the Affordable Care Act.\"</p>", "<p>Bevin's plans do not affect kynect's open enrollment period, which runs through Jan. 31.

The bill now goes to the White House for President Barack Obama's signature.</p>", "<p>The bill boosts highway and transit spending and assures states that federal help will be available for major projects. It doesn't include as much money or last quite as long as many lawmakers and the Obama administration would have liked. Nor does it resolve how to pay for transportation programs in the long term.</p>", "<p>Despite that, the 1,300-page bill was hailed by industry and public officials as a major accomplishment that will halt the cycle of last-minute short-term fixes that have kept the federal Highway Trust Fund teetering on the edge of insolvency for much of the past eight years.</p>", "<p>Republicans leaders can point to the bill's passage as evidence of their ability to govern, and Obama can claim progress on addressing the nation's aging and congested infrastructure, a major goal since the early days of his administration. Lawmakers in both parties praised the bill as a model of bipartisan cooperation and an important step forward.</p>", "<p>The bill \"proves to the American people that we can get big things done,\" said Rep. Bill Shuster, chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. The committee's senior Democrat, Rep. Peter DeFazio of Oregon, called the measure \"historic,\" but cautioned that \"it is a starting point, not the end.\"</p>", "<p>One hallmark of the bill is the creation of new programs to focus federal aid on eliminating bottlenecks and increasing the capacity of highways designated as major freight corridors. The Transportation Department estimates the volume of freight traffic will increase 45 percent over the next 30 years.</p>", "<p>A big shortcoming in the bill, though, is how it's all financed. The main source of revenue for transportation is the trust fund, which comes mostly from the 18.4-cents-a-gallon gasoline tax. That tax hasn't been raised since 1993 even though transportation spending has increased. But raising the gas tax is viewed by many lawmakers as too politically risky.</p>", "<p>To make up the shortfall, the bill uses about $70 billion in mostly budget gimmicks, including one that would move $53 billion from the Federal Reserve Bank's capital account to the general treasury. It's counted as new money on paper, but is actually just a transfer of funds from one government account to another, federal budget experts said.</p>", "<p>Other items in the bill also don't include the means to pay for them, including more than $10 billion over five years for Amtrak and other rail programs, $12 billion for mass transit and $1 billion for vehicle safety programs. The money for those programs remains subject to annual spending decisions by Congress.</p>", "<p>Among the bill's losers are large banks, which would receive lower dividends from the Federal Reserve, with the savings used for transportation programs. Banking officials complained that banks shouldn't be asked to foot the bill for highways and bridges.</p>", "<p>The airline and cruise ship industries complained that their passengers are also being asked to pay for improvements unrelated to their travel. The bill ties customs fees to inflation and uses the increased revenue to offset the bill's cost. It also directs the sale of 66 millions of barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in order to raise $6.5 billion. The catch is the sales don't start until 2023 \u2014 three years after the transportation bill it helps pay for has expired.</p>", "<p>The trucking industry was able to persuade lawmakers to order the government to remove trucking company safety scores from a public website despite opposition from safety advocates. Industry officials say the government's methodology is unfair. But safety advocates won inclusion of a long-sought provision requiring rental car agencies to repair recalled cars and trucks before renting them.</p>", "<p>The bill also addresses several concerns raised by a deadly Amtrak derailment in Philadelphia in May.

The GOP scuttled the meeting, postponing it until 9 p.m. Republican leaders hoped they would have more information available later to help lawmakers navigate the labyrinthine packages. </p>", "<p>\u201cI would anticipate [the bills] would go up hopefully around 10:00,\u201d predicted House Rules Committee Chairman Pete Sessions, R-Texas. </p>", "<p>Finally, the GOP huddled. Many Republicans leaving the conclave seemed optimistic. But not all. Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, was skeptical of the midnight oil prospect of parsing a couple-thousand pages of rigid, legislative text. </p>", "<p>\u201cIt will be a long night. They talk in generalities. I\u2019ve pulled a lot of all-nighters here,\u201d said Gohmert. </p>", "<p>Wasn\u2019t this the same way former House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, used to do things? </p>", "<p>\u201cNot quite,\u201d quipped Gohmert. </p>", "<p>At 11:57 p.m., the House posted what was believed to be text of the bills online. Only they weren\u2019t online. Those bills were essentially placeholders. The full jot and tittle wouldn\u2019t appear until around 1:30 a.m. Wednesday. The omnibus plan was more than 2,000 pages itself. </p>", "<p>Keep in mind: Republicans railed against Democrats for years when they held the majority, accusing them of posting thousands of pages of bills late at night and then jamming them to passage just after sunrise. Republicans aimed to do things differently if they secured the majority in 2010. One commitment was bills would appear \u201conline for at least three days before coming up for a vote in the House of Representatives.\u201d </p>", "<p>Sometimes, these things happened when the GOP won the majority. Sometimes they didn\u2019t. And when they didn\u2019t, various Republican members howled. </p>", "<p>But new House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., promised a different approach. His lieutenants endured to carry out those orders. </p>", "<p>\u201cWe are not going to skip any timeframes,\u201d said Sessions. Rep. Reid Ribble, R-Wis., promised the GOP would take \u201c72 hours\u201d to consider the bills. </p>", "<p>From a technical standpoint, there is no \u201cthree-day rule\u201d in the House, let alone a \u201c72-hour rule.\u201d House rules state lawmakers can\u2019t take up a new bill \u201cuntil the third calendar day it has been available.\u201d In other words, <i>parts</i> of three days. You post the bill Tuesday (just before midnight, sound familiar?), let it sit around on Wednesday and then debate and vote on it Thursday. <i>Parts</i> of the three days. </p>", "<p>But the GOP supposedly missed its mark with the 1:30 a.m. business, right? </p>", "<p>Not really. A closer inspection of the House\u2019s \u201cparts of three days rule\u201d reveals that the regulation \u201cdoes not apply to messages between the Houses.\u201d </p>", "<p>What\u2019s that? It\u2019s simple. The House passes a bill. The Senate approves the same bill, perhaps with changes. But that piece of legislation isn\u2019t quite synched-up yet between the bodies. Thus, lawmakers may have to \u201cping pong\u201d the bill between each chamber until there\u2019s\u00a0 alignment. And, according to House rules, this type of bill doesn\u2019t have to sit around for even parts of three days before lawmakers summon the measure for a debate and vote. </p>", "<p>Republicans engineered the omnibus spending bill and the tax package as \u201cmessages between houses.\u201d They extracted text from old bills sitting around and dumped in new language. As messages between houses, the legislation was exempt from the layover. </p>", "<p>Kind-of-sort-of-three days. But not really. </p>", "<p>This is like the fabled Pirate\u2019s Code in \u201cPirates of the Caribbean.\u201d </p>", "<p>\u201cThe code is more what you\u2019d call <i>guidelines</i> than actual rules,\u201d proclaims Captain Hector Barbossa in the film. </p>", "<p>\u201cThe jury is still out,\u201d said Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus about the omnibus plan. It was Meadows who first called for Boehner\u2019s ouster. But even if Meadows doesn\u2019t back the omnibus, he\u2019s at least satisfied with how Ryan handled the measures. </p>", "<p>\u201cI\u2019ve had more meaningful conversations with the speaker and leadership in the last couple of weeks than I have had in the last few years. I would give it an A-plus trying to reach out to rank-and-file,\u201d opined Meadows. </p>", "<p>\u201cWe played the cards that were dealt the best we can,\u201d said Ryan. </p>", "<p>Sure there was legislation posted overnight. The bills didn\u2019t precisely comport with the \u201cparts of three day rule\u201d\u00a0 -- even though they didn\u2019t have to. And Ryan allowed for breathing space rather than ordering an immediate vote. </p>", "<p>Some things were the same. Some things were different.

While the process has gone more smoothly than some of his predecessor\u2019s budget battles, Ryan faced consternation from both sides of the aisle over the package.</p>", "<p>Democrats were disappointed they were unable to extract more concessions during the process, particularly after Republicans won a long-sought measure to lift the oil export ban in the spending bill. And most Democrats opposed the tax package, complaining it would worsen federal deficits and make it harder to find money for domestic programs they favor.</p>", "<p>But conservatives had their own set of complaints.</p>", "<p>While many Republicans back extending key tax breaks, some were uneasy over the sheer size of the tax-and-spending package. Some were angry over the number of riders attached, and others were angry that certain riders weren\u2019t attached \u2013 specifically to defund Planned Parenthood and tighten Syrian refugee screening.</p>", "<p>And on the sidelines, fiscal watchdog groups were furious over the impact to the deficit.</p>", "<p>\u201cThis bill would dramatically grow the size of government while failing to cut spending in any meaningful way,\u201d Diana Banister, director of Citizens for the Republic, said in a statement. The conservative group ripped both pieces of legislation, including provisions to extend solar and wind energy subsidies.</p>", "<p>The conservative Club for Growth further complained the package to be voted on Friday would \u201cbe like a Christmas tree, filled with gifts to both parties.\u201d</p>", "<p>Some uncertainty arose Thursday over the separate spending measure as House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., suggested there might not be enough Democratic votes to push it through the chamber. The companion spending bill would provide $1.1 trillion to finance government in 2016, leaving only Senate action should it pass before the 2,200-page bundle goes to President Obama.</p>", "<p>The tax bill, meanwhile, would mostly renew scores of existing breaks that have lapsed or are about to, but its scope included victories for both parties.</p>", "<p>Tax credits for college expenses, child costs and lower-earning families are set to become permanent, as would cuts for companies that do research or buy equipment. The measure would make permanent or at least extend reductions for some charitable contributions, builders of energy-efficient homes, producers of Puerto Rican and Virgin Islands rum and owners of auto race tracks.</p>", "<p>Coupled with tax provisions that House leaders stuffed into the spending bill to attract votes, the legislation would cost the government an estimated $680 billion over the next decade. That would pump federal deficits over that period, already projected to total an astronomical $7 trillion, even higher.</p>", "<p>The liberal-leaning Citizens for Tax Justice said in a statement that the package is only increasing the \u201cbudget hole\u201d and \u201cwould lose more revenue than was \u2018raised\u2019 by the fiscal cliff package in 2013.\u201d</p>", "<p>\"It's a significant tax relief measure and of course you know how Republicans like to cut taxes,\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., told The Associated Press, defending the bill.</p>", "<p>Speaker Ryan also responded to concerns about the process itself \u2013 lumping a hodgepodge of issues into a must-pass measure at the end of the year \u2013 during a press conference after the vote.</p>", "<p>\u201cYou know I don\u2019t like this process,\u201d Ryan said, adding that he was dealing with \u201ca cake that was pretty much half-baked\u201d when he took over the job.</p>", "<p>\u201cNext year, we\u2019re going to do things differently,\u201d he vowed, while arguing that the package is a \u201cbipartisan compromise.\u201d</p>", "<p>In a win for Republicans, tucked into the two bills were provisions delaying controversial taxes associated with ObamaCare. A tax on medical devices would be suspended for two years, a levy on health insurers would stop for one year and, in a victory for unions, a tax on higher-cost insurance policies would be postponed two years until 2020.</p>", "<p>Republicans won an end of the four-decade ban on U.S. crude oil exports. The industry said lifting that prohibition would create jobs and lower gasoline prices -- outcomes that opponents said were wrong.</p>", "<p>In exchange, Democrats secured extensions of tax breaks for alternative power sources such as solar and wind energy.</p>", "<p>The spending package up for a vote Friday appeared to be causing more concern from Republicans, particularly members of the House Freedom Caucus.</p>", "<p>Rep.

The system is paid for with a 1 percent tax on all individual health plans sold in the state, both on and off the exchange. Right now, Bevin says about 85,000 people have purchased a private health insurance plan through kynect, or about 2 percent of the population.</p>", "<p>Bevin spokeswoman Jessica Ditto said the fees from the sale of plans on kynect generate between $2.5 million and $4 million of the approximately $27 million it takes to operate the exchange each year.</p>", "<p>\"A majority of Kentuckians are paying a 1 percent assessment on their own premiums to support kynect operations which they do not use,\" Ditto said.</p>", "<p>Once Kentucky moves to the federal exchange, that tax goes up to 3.5 percent.

While Earnest said the administration strongly opposed repealing the Cadillac tax, he didn't address the notion of delaying it.</p>", "<p>The health law's employer mandate is the next likely focus for opponents, said Antos, the economist.</p>", "<p>\"The really large employers are not going to stop offering health insurance, since it's an important benefit,\" he said. \"Even analysts on the left would agree that that mandate isn't going to accomplish much.\"</p>", "<p>Similar to the Cadillac tax, the employer requirement raises concerns on both sides of the political divide.

This amounts to a shrinkage equivalent to approximately 2 million full-time workers.</p>", "<p>The nonpartisan CBO estimates that the decline will come primarily due to workers responding to changes made by the law to federal programs and tax policy. The agency points to the introduction of health care subsidies tied to income as a key factor -- which in turn raises effective tax rates as someone\u2019s earnings rise, therefore reducing the amount of work Americans choose to do.</p>", "<p>\u201cSubsidies decline as income increases, reducing the return on earning additional income,\u201d the report says. \u201cThat decline is effectively an increase in recipients\u2019 effective marginal tax rate, so it generally reduces their work incentives through the substitution effect.\u201d</p>", "<p>Since the subsidies also reduce the burdens attached to unemployment, the CBO predicts that the law will create additional \u201cwork disincentives\u201d for those who are unemployed for part of the year. It concludes that the exchange subsidies will contribute to half of the overall reduction of the labor supply.</p>", "<p>The report also points to direct taxes, such as ACA\u2019s hike of the payroll tax on high earners for Medicare\u2019s Hospital Insurance Program, as a reason for discouraging some from working. Another pressure on wages will come from the employer mandate, which imposes a penalty on employers if they have more than 50 employees and do not provide insurance. The CBO predicts that within a few years this charge will be passed on to employees in the form of lower wages.</p>", "<p>In what will be seen as a positive by ObamaCare\u2019s supporters, the CBO predicts that a contributing factor to the shrinkage in the labor force will be the consequence of insurance subsidies that will make it easier for some people to stop working, or work less, without losing health insurance.</p>", "<p>\u201cSome people would choose to work fewer hours; others would leave the labor force entirely or remain unemployed for longer than they otherwise would,\u201d the report says.</p>", "<p>Republicans hailed the report as yet more proof the controversial law is not working.</p>", "<p>\u201cWhen the President\u2019s health law hurts the labor force at the same time it increases health care premiums and taxes, it\u2019s clear the law is not working for the American people,\u201d Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said in a statement.</p>", "<p>\u201cThe CBO\u2019s latest report confirms yet another broken promise and negative consequence stemming from ObamaCare,\u201d Hatch said.

The companion spending bill would provide $1.1 trillion to finance government in 2016, leaving only Senate action should it pass before the 2,200-page bundle goes to President Obama.</p>", "<p>The tax bill, meanwhile, would mostly renew scores of existing breaks that have lapsed or are about to, but its scope included victories for both parties.</p>", "<p>Tax credits for college expenses, child costs and lower-earning families are set to become permanent, as would cuts for companies that do research or buy equipment. The measure would make permanent or at least extend reductions for some charitable contributions, builders of energy-efficient homes, producers of Puerto Rican and Virgin Islands rum and owners of auto race tracks.</p>", "<p>Coupled with tax provisions that House leaders stuffed into the spending bill to attract votes, the legislation would cost the government an estimated $680 billion over the next decade.

Elijah Cummings. He said he plans to release the emails on Oct. 12, but previewed them extensively in his letter.</p>", "<p>At one point, Blumenthal apparently suggested President Obama back military intervention in Libya in 2011 to help boost his poll numbers; in another spate of emails, according to Gowdy, he appeared to be promoting a company run by an associate that provides training for Libya rebels. In others, he appeared to be mocking Obama and his White House advisers.</p>", "<p>In yet another email, Gowdy claims Blumenthal wrote to Clinton citing the name of a \u201chuman source\u201d for the CIA. \"Armed with that information,\" Gowdy writes, \"Senator Clinton forwarded the email to a colleague -- debunking her claim that she never sent any classified information from her private email address.\"</p>", "<p>One-third of the emails, according to Gowdy, are to/from Blumenthal, who was not a government employee at the time but appeared to send Clinton a steady stream of emails full of foreign policy advice before and after the U.S. intervention in Libya.</p>", "<p>Gowdy\u2019s email release comes at a sensitive time for the Republican-led committee.

It would be interesting to see how his prospects would be affected by Qathafi\u2019s continuing presence in Tripoli in November 2012 and the mockery Republicans will rain down on him over his present weakness.\u201d</p>", "<p>According to Gowdy, Blumenthal was a bit snarky when talking about the Obama administration, at one point reportedly writing that \u201c[Obama] and his political cronies in the WH and Chicago are, to say the least, unenthusiastic about regime change in Libya or anywhere else in the ME. Why is that?

But the emails tell more of the story, Gowdy says, pointing to excepts that appear to reference a deal between Osprey and the National Transition Council (TNR) in Libya.</p>", "<p>At one point, according to a portion in the letter, Blumenthal wrote that, \u201cTyler, Cody and I acted as honest brokers, putting this arrangement together through a series of connections, linking the Libyans to Osprey and keeping it moving.\u201d The arrangement, as described, was to help train and organize the opposition forces.</p>", "<p>For her part, Clinton appeared interested in her short responses to Blumenthal, according Gowdy, often forwarding the memos to top aide Jake Sullivan and asking him to read and respond to her later. In reaction to Blumenthal\u2019s alarms about poll numbers and Obama\u2019s \u2018present weakness\u2019 over Libya, Clinton apparently told Sullivan: \u201cThis is quite troubling \u2026 I agree about the need to keep the attack tempo up.\u201d</p>", "<p>After Blumenthal was brought for a private interview with the committee in June, his lawyer James M.

It's hard to plan major construction projects when availability of federal aid is in doubt.</p>", "<p>Since 2008, Congress has kept the federal Highway Trust Fund teetering on the edge of bankruptcy, unwilling to raise the federal 18.4 cents-a-gallon gasoline and 24.4-cent diesel taxes. The fuel taxes, the trust fund's main source of revenue, were last raised in 1993. Transportation aid has continued through dozens of short-term extensions and transfers of money from the general treasury to make up the gap between revenues and spending.</p>", "<p>The House bill is filled with changes to transportation policy that reflect the small-government, pro-business philosophy of the chamber's GOP majority. But it is also a compromise that Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman Bill Shuster, R-Pa., spent months negotiating with Rep. Peter DeFazio of Oregon, the panel's top Democrat. As a result, the bill also includes many provisions sought by Democrats or supported by lawmakers from both parties, and avoids some of the most divisive proposals.</p>", "<p>\"Republicans, Democrats, Americans care about our infrastructure and want to get to work without delays, want to get products to market, and want to get the raw materials to the factories that keep us competitive in this world,\" Shuster said.</p>", "<p>One change that gained wide support would direct $4.5 billion a year to interstate highways and other roads designated as freight corridors to increase capacity and relieve bottlenecks, and a grant program of more than $700 million a year for nationally significant highway and freight projects.</p>", "<p>The measure was the first major bill on the House floor since Rep. Paul Ryan became speaker, and it reflected the Wisconsin Republican's promise to give rank-and-file lawmakers greater clout in shaping legislation -- something they complained they lacked under Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, who resigned under fire last week.</p>", "<p>More than 100 amendments were debated on the House floor over two days. But scores of other amendments were blocked from consideration by GOP leaders, including a proposal by Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore., to raise the gas tax, and another by Rep. John Delaney, D-Md., to tax profits U.S. corporations park overseas and use that tax to pay for transportation programs.</p>", "<p>The Obama administration has offered a similar tax proposal, and Ryan has backed the general concept. But negotiations between Ryan and Charles Schumer of New York, the No. 3 Senate Democratic leader, failed to produce an agreement. Such a one-time cash infusion also wouldn't solve the trust fund's long-term problems.</p>", "<p>The administration has complained that the House bill doesn't contain enough money. Keeping funding steady won't keep up with rising population and aging infrastructure, the White House said in a statement. \"The Congress should be thinking big, not locking in a worsening system.\"</p>", "<p>Even maintaining status-quo spending on transportation requires Congress to raise more revenue or cut spending elsewhere. Unable to come up with their own solutions, the House chose to embrace the same money-raising provisions that the Senate included in its transportation bill, even though many in the House had previously derided them as budget gimmickry.</p>", "<p>One provision, for example, assumes $9.1 billion can be raised by selling oil in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve at $89 per barrel, about twice the current price. Another assumes $5 billion can be raised by having the IRS use private debt collectors to recover back taxes, something that in the past has cost the government more than it raised.</p>"]}

This amounts to a shrinkage equivalent to approximately 2 million full-time workers.</p>", "<p>The nonpartisan CBO estimates that the decline will come primarily due to workers responding to changes made by the law to federal programs and tax policy. The agency points to the introduction of health care subsidies tied to income as a key factor -- which in turn raises effective tax rates as someone\u2019s earnings rise, therefore reducing the amount of work Americans choose to do.</p>", "<p>\u201cSubsidies decline as income increases, reducing the return on earning additional income,\u201d the report says. \u201cThat decline is effectively an increase in recipients\u2019 effective marginal tax rate, so it generally reduces their work incentives through the substitution effect.\u201d</p>", "<p>Since the subsidies also reduce the burdens attached to unemployment, the CBO predicts that the law will create additional \u201cwork disincentives\u201d for those who are unemployed for part of the year. It concludes that the exchange subsidies will contribute to half of the overall reduction of the labor supply.</p>", "<p>The report also points to direct taxes, such as ACA\u2019s hike of the payroll tax on high earners for Medicare\u2019s Hospital Insurance Program, as a reason for discouraging some from working. Another pressure on wages will come from the employer mandate, which imposes a penalty on employers if they have more than 50 employees and do not provide insurance. The CBO predicts that within a few years this charge will be passed on to employees in the form of lower wages.</p>", "<p>In what will be seen as a positive by ObamaCare\u2019s supporters, the CBO predicts that a contributing factor to the shrinkage in the labor force will be the consequence of insurance subsidies that will make it easier for some people to stop working, or work less, without losing health insurance.</p>", "<p>\u201cSome people would choose to work fewer hours; others would leave the labor force entirely or remain unemployed for longer than they otherwise would,\u201d the report says.</p>", "<p>Republicans hailed the report as yet more proof the controversial law is not working.</p>", "<p>\u201cWhen the President\u2019s health law hurts the labor force at the same time it increases health care premiums and taxes, it\u2019s clear the law is not working for the American people,\u201d Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said in a statement.</p>", "<p>\u201cThe CBO\u2019s latest report confirms yet another broken promise and negative consequence stemming from ObamaCare,\u201d Hatch said.

It's counted as new money on paper, but is actually just a transfer of funds from one government account to another, federal budget experts said.</p>", "<p>Other items in the bill also don't include the means to pay for them, including more than $10 billion over five years for Amtrak and other rail programs, $12 billion for mass transit and $1 billion for vehicle safety programs. The money for those programs remains subject to annual spending decisions by Congress.</p>", "<p>Among the bill's losers are large banks, which would receive lower dividends from the Federal Reserve, with the savings used for transportation programs. Banking officials complained that banks shouldn't be asked to foot the bill for highways and bridges.</p>", "<p>The airline and cruise ship industries complained that their passengers are also being asked to pay for improvements unrelated to their travel. The bill ties customs fees to inflation and uses the increased revenue to offset the bill's cost. It also directs the sale of 66 millions of barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in order to raise $6.5 billion. The catch is the sales don't start until 2023 \u2014 three years after the transportation bill it helps pay for has expired.</p>", "<p>The trucking industry was able to persuade lawmakers to order the government to remove trucking company safety scores from a public website despite opposition from safety advocates. Industry officials say the government's methodology is unfair. But safety advocates won inclusion of a long-sought provision requiring rental car agencies to repair recalled cars and trucks before renting them.</p>", "<p>The bill also addresses several concerns raised by a deadly Amtrak derailment in Philadelphia in May. It provides $200 million to help passenger railroads install positive train control technology that accident investigators say could have prevent the derailment had it been in operation. It also raises the liability cap on total damages that can be awarded in such crashes from $200 million to $295 million. The derailment killed eight people and injured nearly 200 others.</p>", "<p>The Amalgamated Transit Union, which represents city bus drivers, won a provision requiring the government to direct transit agencies to take steps to protect bus drivers from assault, a growing problem. The Federal Transit Administration is required to consider whether local transit agencies provide bathroom breaks and access to bathrooms for bus drivers when evaluating the safety of the agencies.</p>", "<p>A provision sponsored by Rep. Dina Titus, a Nevada Democrat whose district includes Las Vegas, authorizes the creation of a national advisory committee made up of travel and tourism industry officials to develop a national strategy for ensuring that transportation policies address the needs of travelers. Another provision sought by the dairy industry and sponsored by upstate New York, Connecticut and Wisconsin allows trucks hauling milk to exceed federal weight limits for interstate highways in some cases.</p>"]}

But it provides money for only the first three years because lawmakers couldn't agree on a way to pay for it all. The measure would continue current rates of spending, adjusted for inflation.</p>", "<p>At least $400 billion over six years is needed to prevent traffic congestion from getting worse, Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx has said.</p>", "<p>The bill is similar to a transportation bill passed by the Senate in July. Congressional leaders say they hope to quickly work out the differences between the two measures and send President Barack Obama a final bill before Thanksgiving. They also said they hope to find the money to pay for the last three years of the bill, but offered no details on how that might happen.</p>", "<p>Most lawmakers lauded the bill as a major accomplishment because it would assure states and localities that they can count on federal highway and transit aid for at least three years. It's hard to plan major construction projects when availability of federal aid is in doubt.</p>", "<p>Since 2008, Congress has kept the federal Highway Trust Fund teetering on the edge of bankruptcy, unwilling to raise the federal 18.4 cents-a-gallon gasoline and 24.4-cent diesel taxes. The fuel taxes, the trust fund's main source of revenue, were last raised in 1993. Transportation aid has continued through dozens of short-term extensions and transfers of money from the general treasury to make up the gap between revenues and spending.</p>", "<p>The House bill is filled with changes to transportation policy that reflect the small-government, pro-business philosophy of the chamber's GOP majority. But it is also a compromise that Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman Bill Shuster, R-Pa., spent months negotiating with Rep. Peter DeFazio of Oregon, the panel's top Democrat. As a result, the bill also includes many provisions sought by Democrats or supported by lawmakers from both parties, and avoids some of the most divisive proposals.</p>", "<p>\"Republicans, Democrats, Americans care about our infrastructure and want to get to work without delays, want to get products to market, and want to get the raw materials to the factories that keep us competitive in this world,\" Shuster said.</p>", "<p>One change that gained wide support would direct $4.5 billion a year to interstate highways and other roads designated as freight corridors to increase capacity and relieve bottlenecks, and a grant program of more than $700 million a year for nationally significant highway and freight projects.</p>", "<p>The measure was the first major bill on the House floor since Rep. Paul Ryan became speaker, and it reflected the Wisconsin Republican's promise to give rank-and-file lawmakers greater clout in shaping legislation -- something they complained they lacked under Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, who resigned under fire last week.</p>", "<p>More than 100 amendments were debated on the House floor over two days. But scores of other amendments were blocked from consideration by GOP leaders, including a proposal by Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore., to raise the gas tax, and another by Rep. John Delaney, D-Md., to tax profits U.S. corporations park overseas and use that tax to pay for transportation programs.</p>", "<p>The Obama administration has offered a similar tax proposal, and Ryan has backed the general concept. But negotiations between Ryan and Charles Schumer of New York, the No. 3 Senate Democratic leader, failed to produce an agreement. Such a one-time cash infusion also wouldn't solve the trust fund's long-term problems.</p>", "<p>The administration has complained that the House bill doesn't contain enough money. Keeping funding steady won't keep up with rising population and aging infrastructure, the White House said in a statement. \"The Congress should be thinking big, not locking in a worsening system.\"</p>", "<p>Even maintaining status-quo spending on transportation requires Congress to raise more revenue or cut spending elsewhere. Unable to come up with their own solutions, the House chose to embrace the same money-raising provisions that the Senate included in its transportation bill, even though many in the House had previously derided them as budget gimmickry.</p>", "<p>One provision, for example, assumes $9.1 billion can be raised by selling oil in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve at $89 per barrel, about twice the current price. Another assumes $5 billion can be raised by having the IRS use private debt collectors to recover back taxes, something that in the past has cost the government more than it raised.</p>"]}

Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., provided this and other details Thursday, as part of a batch of new Clinton emails he says will shed light on Blumenthal\u2019s complex role as unofficial political adviser to then-Secretary of State Clinton.</p>", "<p>\u201cIt is curious Secretary Clinton took so much of her advice from someone who had never been to Libya, professed no independent knowledge of the country and who the White House blocked her from hiring,\u201d Gowdy said in a statement Thursday.</p>", "<p>He detailed the emails in a letter to the panel\u2019s ranking Democrat, Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings. He said he plans to release the emails on Oct. 12, but previewed them extensively in his letter.</p>", "<p>At one point, Blumenthal apparently suggested President Obama back military intervention in Libya in 2011 to help boost his poll numbers; in another spate of emails, according to Gowdy, he appeared to be promoting a company run by an associate that provides training for Libya rebels. In others, he appeared to be mocking Obama and his White House advisers.</p>", "<p>In yet another email, Gowdy claims Blumenthal wrote to Clinton citing the name of a \u201chuman source\u201d for the CIA. \"Armed with that information,\" Gowdy writes, \"Senator Clinton forwarded the email to a colleague -- debunking her claim that she never sent any classified information from her private email address.\"</p>", "<p>One-third of the emails, according to Gowdy, are to/from Blumenthal, who was not a government employee at the time but appeared to send Clinton a steady stream of emails full of foreign policy advice before and after the U.S. intervention in Libya.</p>", "<p>Gowdy\u2019s email release comes at a sensitive time for the Republican-led committee. The panel has taken a drubbing in the press lately, after Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., suggested in an interview with Fox News that the panel could be linked to Hillary Clinton\u2019s dropping poll numbers, fueling Democratic claims the committee is political in nature. He later explained he \u201cnever meant to imply\u201d that was the case.</p>", "<p>Cummings\u2019 office hit back on the latest salvo on Thursday, calling it \u201ca defensive and desperate attempt to save face,\u201d that only proves Gowdy is more focused on embarrassing Clinton than investigating the 2012 attacks on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi.</p>", "<p>Cumming said Democrats have been asking Gowdy for weeks to release the full load of Clinton emails, as well as the entire transcript of Blumenthal\u2019s eight-hour deposition to the committee, \u201cin which he answered hundreds of questions form Republicans about his e-mail.\u201d</p>", "<p>Nevertheless, the committee is painting a more colorful picture of Blumenthal\u2019s role as an unofficial adviser at a time when the U.S. was considering its controversial foray into Libya. A year after the government fell with the help of the U.S. and its allies, militants attacked the diplomatic compound and today Libya remains a volatile, failed state.</p>", "<p>Gowdy says the new emails suggest Blumenthal is a \u201cpolitical body\u201d who pushed for a more aggressive posture on Libya -- including sustained bombing and training and arming rebels on the ground in 2011 \u2013 to boost administration poll numbers.</p>", "<p>From one apparent email quoted by Gowdy: \u00a0</p>", "<p>\u201cObama should think about the political effect here in the U.S. of defeat of Qathafi\u2019s forces,\u201d Blumenthal apparently wrote of the Libyan dictator, who was eventually killed by opposition forces. \u201cHe wants to be re-elected? It would be interesting to see how his prospects would be affected by Qathafi\u2019s continuing presence in Tripoli in November 2012 and the mockery Republicans will rain down on him over his present weakness.\u201d</p>", "<p>According to Gowdy, Blumenthal was a bit snarky when talking about the Obama administration, at one point reportedly writing that \u201c[Obama] and his political cronies in the WH and Chicago are, to say the least, unenthusiastic about regime change in Libya or anywhere else in the ME. Why is that? Hmmm.\u201d</p>", "<p>Blumenthal also allegedly mocked \u201cNational Security Adviser Tom Donilon\u2019s babbling rhetoric about \u2018narratives\u2019\u201d on a phone briefing with reporters. \u00a0</p>", "<p>Gowdy says most of Blumenthal\u2019s shared intel on Libya came from his associates, former high-ranking CIA operative Tyler Drumheller, and Cody Shearer.</p>", "<p>Gowdy argues the new emails also show Blumenthal had a monetary interest in seeing the U.S. intervention in Libya go forward, noting that Blumenthal and Drumheller have acknowledged their stake in Osprey Global Solutions, a private security company. But the emails tell more of the story, Gowdy says, pointing to excepts that appear to reference a deal between Osprey and the National Transition Council (TNR) in Libya.</p>", "<p>At one point, according to a portion in the letter, Blumenthal wrote that, \u201cTyler, Cody and I acted as honest brokers, putting this arrangement together through a series of connections, linking the Libyans to Osprey and keeping it moving.\u201d The arrangement, as described, was to help train and organize the opposition forces.</p>", "<p>For her part, Clinton appeared interested in her short responses to Blumenthal, according Gowdy, often forwarding the memos to top aide Jake Sullivan and asking him to read and respond to her later. In reaction to Blumenthal\u2019s alarms about poll numbers and Obama\u2019s \u2018present weakness\u2019 over Libya, Clinton apparently told Sullivan: \u201cThis is quite troubling \u2026 I agree about the need to keep the attack tempo up.\u201d</p>", "<p>After Blumenthal was brought for a private interview with the committee in June, his lawyer James M. Cole wrote a letter to Gowdy, criticizing Republicans\u2019 decision to leak only portions of his testimony and emails to the press.</p>", "<p>\u201cLeaks like these are distorting the truth by mischaracterizing facts and circumstances,\u201d Cole wrote. \u201cThey are creating an incomplete and unfair narrative about the deposition, Mr. Blumenthal\u2019s knowledge about Libya, and the tragedy that occurred in Benghazi.\u201d</p>", "<p>Cole could not be reached for comment on the letter Thursday.</p>", "<p><i>FoxNews.com's Kelley Vlahos contributed to this report.</i></p>", "<p>\u00a0</p>"]}

It had earlier swept through the House on a pair of decisive votes on Thursday and Friday, marking a peaceful end to a yearlong struggle over the budget, taxes, and Republican efforts to derail his regulatory agenda.</p>", "<p>Obama signed the measure friday evening, which includes many of the spending increases he fought for all year and is largely cleansed of GOP attempts to block his moves on the environment, financial regulation, and consumer protection. Republicans won increases for the military and an end to a ban on exporting U.S. oil, as well as permanent tax cuts for business investment.</p>", "<p>Republicans were evenly split with 27 of them voting in favor and 26 against the bill. Presidential contender Marco Rubio was absent. Only six Democrats and Independent Bernie Sanders, another presidential hopeful, voted against the measure.</p>", "<p>With the votes, lawmakers wrapped up a surprisingly productive, bipartisan burst of late-session legislation in a divided Congress.</p>", "<p>The measure received big bipartisan majorities in both House and Senate. It capped an impressive first few weeks for new Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., who got the benefit of the doubt from most Republicans, who by a wide margin opposed earlier legislation that established the framework for the budget package.</p>", "<p>House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California, a key negotiator, swung forcefully behind the measure after showing initial frustration over its lifting of an oil export ban and lack of action on helping Puerto Rico address its fiscal woes.</p>", "<p>\"They wanted big oil so much that they gave away the store,\" Pelosi said. But she cited successes in driving away most GOP policy proposals from the measure. Democratic also pushed through higher domestic budgets and tax breaks for working families and renewable energy.</p>", "<p>\"This bipartisan compromise secures meaningful wins for Republicans and the American people, such as the repeal of the outdated, anti-growth ban on oil exports,\" Ryan said, citing a large increase for the Pentagon and curbs on the activities of the Environmental Protection Agency and the IRS.</p>", "<p>Some Tea Party lawmakers were dismayed by the burst of spending and a lack of wins for conservatives.</p>", "<p>\"There are so many things in this bill that will be surprising and shocking to the American people,\" said Rep. Walter Jones, R-N.C. \"Maybe there is a Santa Claus. At least in the House.\"</p>", "<p>The House voted on the spending portion of the measure on Friday, when it won support from House Republicans by a 150-95 margin. Democrats followed Pelosi's lead and backed the bill by a 166-18 margin. In a procedural quirk, the House passed most of the tax cuts -- virtually all of them financed with deficit dollars -- on Thursday.</p>", "<p>The bill extends more than 50 expiring tax cuts, with more than 20 becoming permanent, including credits for companies' expenditures for research and equipment purchases and reductions for lower-earning families and households with children and college students.</p>", "<p>The spending measure would fund the operations of every Cabinet agency. It awards increases of about 6 percent, on average, above tight spending caps that were a relic of a 2011 budget and debt deal -- and were opposed by both GOP defense hawks and Democrats seeking boosts in domestic spending.</p>", "<p>The House vote bundled with the spending measure a tax bill that passed on Thursday.</p>", "<p>The budget pact was the last major item in a late-session flurry of bipartisanship in Washington, including easy passage of long-stalled legislation funding highway programs and a rewrite of education programs.</p>", "<p>Many on each side saw the budget deal as the best they could get under divided government. The need to win Obama's signature helped rid the measure of most of the controversial GOP provisions: killing federal money for Planned Parenthood, limiting the flow of Syrian refugees and undoing dozens of Obama actions on the environment, labor, financial regulation and relations with Cuba.</p>", "<p>The measure contains large spending boosts for veterans and medical research, and funds a familiar roster of grants for transportation projects, first responders and community development.</p>", "<p>It also clears away an almost $1 billion backlog of federal courthouse projects and sends hundreds of millions of dollars to the states and districts of a handful of powerful lawmakers such as Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., and Rep. Harold Rogers, R-Ky., the chairmen of the Appropriations committees.</p>", "<p>Also crammed into the two bills are provisions trimming some of the levies that help finance Obama's prized 2010 health care overhaul. The White House opposed the rollbacks, but Republicans and many Democrats savored them. A tax on medical devices would be suspended for two years, a levy on health insurers would stop for a year and, in a victory for unions, a tax on higher-cost insurance policies would be postponed two years until 2020.</p>", "<p>In exchange for ending the oil export ban, Democrats won extensions of tax breaks for alternative power sources such as solar and wind energy.</p>", "<p>Other extended tax cuts include breaks for some teachers, commuters, timber investors, electric vehicle owners and makers of hard cider drinks. People in the seven states without income taxes will be able to deduct local sales taxes on their federal returns.</p>", "<p>\u00a0</p>"]}

Some people venture off on yoga retreats in search of an awakening. Some seek mental silence in the mountains or by the sea. The congressman basically does this, too. Only Blumenauer finds a sanctum in the solitude of his kitchen, not off in the wilderness somewhere. He looks for enlightenment amid dozens of egg cartons, cheesecloth, bags of flour, raisins and sticks of butter.</p>", "<p>Some people follow the path of Dharma.</p>", "<p>Blumenauer follows the path of fruitcake.</p>", "<p>For about a quarter-century now, Blumenauer once a year cranks out 200-plus fruitcakes and hand-delivers them to constituents, friends, fellow lawmakers and even journalists. He penned an essay about the baking mechanics titled \u201cThe Zen of Fruitcake.\u201d</p>", "<p>\u201cAfter six or eight hours of baking, as I mix, sort, sift, ladle, and bake, I discover an interesting physiological connection, like being in the middle of a long run or a hike on a remote trail,\u201d writes Blumenauer. \u201cI get lost in the rhythm, my mind is released to think great thoughts or reflect on the mundane. A kaleidoscope of images pops up as I build my own momentum. Whether hiking, running, or baking, I am drawn by muscle memory and instinct. I find I don\u2019t have to check the recipe to think about how many egg yolks to separate, where they go, or what comes next. The process has become part of my subconscious and physiology.\u201d</p>", "<p>Blumenauer says politics is a \u201cstrange business\u201d and the cadence of making a fruitcake makes a nice \u201cdiversion.\u201d</p>", "<p>\u201cIt\u2019s easy to get lost in the process,\u201d said the congressman who often starts his kitchen trance at 7 a.m. and not finishing until after midnight. \u201cI don\u2019t think I thought of death panels while I was separating eggs. It does free you.\u201d</p>", "<p>The Oregon Democrat got hooked on fruitcake as a kid. An uncle from Texas would send along a fruitcake tin or two at Christmas-time.</p>", "<p>\u201cAs a child, I actually liked fruitcake,\u201d Blumenauer said. He noted that those fruitcakes were tasty and weren\u2019t ones that \u201cneeded a chisel to eat.\u201d</p>", "<p>As it turned out, the youthful Blumenauer found himself devouring the fruitcakes himself.</p>", "<p>\u201cThere wasn\u2019t a pitched battle for it,\u201d he said.</p>", "<p>In the early 1990s, the congressman tried his hand at baking a few, based on a New York Times recipe. Before long, the venture eventually \u201cmetastasized\u201d (Blumenauer\u2019s word) into a 225 fruitcake-a-year enterprise.</p>", "<p>Blumenauer believes he\u2019s baked more than 5,000 fruitcakes in his life. His wife even purchased the congressman an industrial-strength Mixmaster to ease the process.</p>", "<p>Blumenauer starts ordering the ingredients in early November. He describes the makeup of his fruitcake as \u201cquintessential Oregon.\u201d Locally produced cherries, citron, lemon and orange peel. A drizzle of pear brandy from the Clear Creek Distillery in Portland accompanies the fruitcake.</p>", "<p>Dumping all of those ingredients together into one vat sounds a lot like the legislative process \u2013 much like crafting the omnibus spending bill that Congress approved last week to fund the government.</p>", "<p>\u201cAt least I know what\u2019s in my fruitcake,\u201d quipped Blumenauer. \u201cMy recipes have greater precision and less toxic ingredients.\u201d</p>", "<p>He describes the consistency of his Christmas treat as, well, \u201ccakey\u201d and \u201clighter\u201d than other fruitcakes.</p>", "<p>Blumenauer says most people who score one of his fruitcakes are appreciative \u2013 although he wonders if some might prefer the miniature bottles of brandy that come with them.</p>", "<p>\u201cPeople make fun of fruitcake,\u201d Blumenauer conceded. \u201c\u2018You made this?\u2019 they ask. There are few fruitcake aficionados.\u201d</p>", "<p>Blumenauer distributes his fruitcakes to members of the House Ways and Means Committee (a panel on which he serves) and members of the congressional leadership. As a result, House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., has marshaled a fruitcake in both his new role and as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. Blumenauer usually takes a tray of fruitcake to meetings of the House Democratic Caucus.</p>", "<p>Blumenauer wanted to smuggle one into the White House for the annual holiday party but was afraid the Secret Service might flag the fruitcake as a \u201csuspicious package.\u201d</p>", "<p>Sometimes the congressman gets handwritten notes and mail about his baking exploits. Blumenauer says he used to keep a file full of cards riddled with snarky fruitcake commentary from recipients. Other replies were more formal. The congressman said Portland State University President Wim Wiewel penned a note characterizing it as \u201ca high honor\u201d to receive one of Blumenauer\u2019s storied fruitcakes.</p>", "<p>Sometimes people forget about fruitcake. People plow through the cookies and pies and cobblers. And then after the holidays, they realize there\u2019s nothing else left \u2026 <i>except</i> the fruitcake.</p>", "<p>Blumenauer says that\u2019s all right.</p>", "<p>\u201cThere\u2019s a durability to it,\u201d said Blumenauer. \u201cIt will last the entire year or longer.

A kaleidoscope of images pops up as I build my own momentum. Whether hiking, running, or baking, I am drawn by muscle memory and instinct. I find I don\u2019t have to check the recipe to think about how many egg yolks to separate, where they go, or what comes next.

It had earlier swept through the House on a pair of decisive votes on Thursday and Friday, marking a peaceful end to a yearlong struggle over the budget, taxes, and Republican efforts to derail his regulatory agenda.</p>", "<p>Obama signed the measure friday evening, which includes many of the spending increases he fought for all year and is largely cleansed of GOP attempts to block his moves on the environment, financial regulation, and consumer protection. Republicans won increases for the military and an end to a ban on exporting U.S. oil, as well as permanent tax cuts for business investment.</p>", "<p>Republicans were evenly split with 27 of them voting in favor and 26 against the bill.

Only six Democrats and Independent Bernie Sanders, another presidential hopeful, voted against the measure.</p>", "<p>With the votes, lawmakers wrapped up a surprisingly productive, bipartisan burst of late-session legislation in a divided Congress.</p>", "<p>The measure received big bipartisan majorities in both House and Senate.

But she cited successes in driving away most GOP policy proposals from the measure. Democratic also pushed through higher domestic budgets and tax breaks for working families and renewable energy.</p>", "<p>\"This bipartisan compromise secures meaningful wins for Republicans and the American people, such as the repeal of the outdated, anti-growth ban on oil exports,\" Ryan said, citing a large increase for the Pentagon and curbs on the activities of the Environmental Protection Agency and the IRS.</p>", "<p>Some Tea Party lawmakers were dismayed by the burst of spending and a lack of wins for conservatives.</p>", "<p>\"There are so many things in this bill that will be surprising and shocking to the American people,\" said Rep.

It awards increases of about 6 percent, on average, above tight spending caps that were a relic of a 2011 budget and debt deal -- and were opposed by both GOP defense hawks and Democrats seeking boosts in domestic spending.</p>", "<p>The House vote bundled with the spending measure a tax bill that passed on Thursday.</p>", "<p>The budget pact was the last major item in a late-session flurry of bipartisanship in Washington, including easy passage of long-stalled legislation funding highway programs and a rewrite of education programs.</p>", "<p>Many on each side saw the budget deal as the best they could get under divided government. The need to win Obama's signature helped rid the measure of most of the controversial GOP provisions: killing federal money for Planned Parenthood, limiting the flow of Syrian refugees and undoing dozens of Obama actions on the environment, labor, financial regulation and relations with Cuba.</p>", "<p>The measure contains large spending boosts for veterans and medical research, and funds a familiar roster of grants for transportation projects, first responders and community development.</p>", "<p>It also clears away an almost $1 billion backlog of federal courthouse projects and sends hundreds of millions of dollars to the states and districts of a handful of powerful lawmakers such as Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., and Rep.

A tax on medical devices would be suspended for two years, a levy on health insurers would stop for a year and, in a victory for unions, a tax on higher-cost insurance policies would be postponed two years until 2020.</p>", "<p>In exchange for ending the oil export ban, Democrats won extensions of tax breaks for alternative power sources such as solar and wind energy.</p>", "<p>Other extended tax cuts include breaks for some teachers, commuters, timber investors, electric vehicle owners and makers of hard cider drinks.

And things are more or less at a standstill on Capitol Hill.</p>", "<p>To wit:</p>", "<p>The Senate met all but for a few moments during the first week of January, not really pursuing much of anything until week two.</p>", "<p>The second week of January featured President Obama\u2019s State of the Union speech. The House voted to send Obama a bill to defund Planned Parenthood and repeal ObamaCare \u2013 even though lawmakers knew he would veto it. House and Senate Republicans then jumped buses for an issues retreat in Baltimore.</p>", "<p>Then it was the House\u2019s turn to take off last week. The Senate had a few procedural votes and an important hearing on the nomination of Eric Fanning to lead the Army. But then the Senate skedaddled just in time for the storm. As the first the flakes fell, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., announced that the House of Representatives wouldn\u2019t hold any votes on Monday. The storm would make it too hard for lawmakers to jet back into town. Airline schedules would be topsy-turvy and it would take a few days to recover.</p>", "<p>Over the weekend, McCarthy then postponed all votes for this week. It was supposed to be a short week anyway. This time, House Democrats were trekking to Baltimore for their annual retreat and to hear from Obama and Vice President Biden, among others.</p>", "<p>The House had planned to revote a bill to dump sanctions on Iran this week. The House originally approved the measure two weeks ago. But House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., is enforcing time discipline in the House -- 137 lawmakers were late and missed the vote, so House GOP leadership agreed to nullify the result and vote again. But with weather snarling all modes of traffic in and out of Washington, a lot more than 137 members would have missed the vote early this week. The House was also scheduled to vote to override Obama\u2019s veto of the ObamaCare repeal/Planned Parenthood defund legislation this week. But that\u2019s off the books now, too.</p>", "<p>The Senate punted the confirmation vote of John Vazquez to serve on the federal bench in New Jersey from Tuesday night until Wednesday night. On Thursday, the Senate plans work on a bill to modernize energy programs.</p>", "<p>The Iowa caucuses are Monday. The New Hampshire primary hits Feb. 9</p>", "<p>Think anyone will pay attention to Capitol Hill during that time?</p>", "<p>The House intends to be in session all next week and the week following. But the House is out the week of Feb. 14.</p>", "<p>Keep in mind that the Republican leadership plans for the House to be out of session from July 16 through Sept. 6 to accommodate the Democratic and Republican conventions. The House also won\u2019t meet from Oct. 1 through Nov. 14. And then it takes a week for Thanksgiving. So just five weeks of session between July 15 and Nov. 29 \u2013 when the House convenes after the Thanksgiving recess.</p>", "<p>Now to be fair, days in session is not a good rubric to measure the productivity of Congress. Nor is the number of bills the House and Senate may pass. Lawmakers work constantly, attending to issues in their districts, talking to constituents and working the phones. It can be a 24/7 job. On multiple occasions, former House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said people should judge Congress \u201con how many laws we repeal\u201d versus \u201chow many new laws\u201d lawmakers pass. This was a take on a saying by President Calvin Coolidge: \u201cIt is much more important to kill bad bills than to pass good ones.\u201d</p>", "<p>It\u2019s kind of like statistics in baseball. Does a guy crack 30 home runs but none in the clutch? Or how valuable is a guy who hits .300 with runners in scoring position? What\u2019s his WAR?</p>", "<p>Like Major League Baseball, there are statistics inside the statistics when it comes to Congress. We haven\u2019t even addressed the important work Congress does with oversight, investigations and hearings. As the expression goes, not everything that counts can be counted and vice-versa. But, you can imagine the metric that the general public uses to gauge congressional success or failure. There\u2019s a skepticism when they see a schedule like the one published for this calendar year.</p>", "<p>Keep in mind, this week\u2019s schedule alterations were out of necessity. The word Congress means \u201ccoming together.\u201d If half the East Coast is paralyzed by a record-setting blizzard with anywhere from a foot to three feet of snow on the ground, people aren\u2019t going to \u201ccome together.\u201d</p>", "<p>Cue the Beatles.</p>", "<p>The headlines popped this fall when Ryan announced his candidacy for speaker. He said Congress needed an \u201cambitious\u201d agenda. Yet, one might question how lawmakers can tackle a broad agenda with such little time on the calendar.</p>", "<p>Of course, some would prefer Congress not meet much at all. Gideon John Tucker, a mid-19<sup>th</sup> Century attorney, once worked on a case involving a will -- and famously declared \u201cno man\u2019s life, liberty or property are safe while the legislature is in session.\u201d</p>", "<p>Congress hasn\u2019t been around much to start 2016. And it won\u2019t be around much the rest of the year. And those who feel the same as Gideon John Tucker think that\u2019s a good thing.</p>", "<p><i>Capitol Attitude is a weekly column written by members of the Fox News Capitol Hill team.

Paul Ryan, R-Wis., who is seeking the job in votes set for Wednesday and Thursday.\u00a0</p>", "<p>\"I've done my best to clean it up,\" Boehner said.\u00a0</p>", "<p>However, further complicating the deal's future, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., told Fox News Tuesday night that if the plan passes the House, he plans to filibuster it in the Senate.</p>", "<p>The pact would fund the government for another two years, ahead of a Dec. 11 deadline to pass a new budget. The legislation also would suspend the current $18.1 trillion debt limit through March 2017. The deadline for doing so is Nov. 3, after which the government might be unable to fund all benefits and agency budgets, and face a potential government default, if the cap is not raised.\u00a0</p>", "<p>But some House conservatives blasted the deal as not going far enough to address excess spending.\u00a0</p>", "<p>Rep. John Fleming, R-La., said he's going to \"whip against it.\"\u00a0</p>", "<p>\"Leadership's determination to ram through this legislation days before we reach the debt limit, with zero input from rank and file Members of Congress, demonstrates precisely what is wrong with Washington, D.C.,\" Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., said.\u00a0</p>", "<p>Other Republicans were resigned to likely passage, as they took their parting shots at Boehner.\u00a0</p>", "<p>\"We can't stop it. He's in league with the Democrats,\" Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., said of Boehner Tuesday morning. \"I mean I don't think there's anything you can do at this point.\"\u00a0</p>", "<p>But Massie also said \"it's a long game\" and conservatives are winning the war as they have forced Boehner to resign.\u00a0</p>", "<p>The budget vote slated for Wednesday would come on the same day the GOP caucus nominates its candidate, widely expected to be Ryan. The speaker-to-be held off on assessing the deal, saying he had to review it, but he expressed frustration with the rush job.\u00a0</p>", "<p>\"I think this process stinks. This is not the way to do the people's business,\" Ryan told reporters. \"Under new management, we're not going to do the people's business this way.\"\u00a0</p>", "<p>The budget side of the deal is aimed at undoing automatic spending cuts which are a byproduct of a 2011 budget and debt agreement, and the failure of Washington to subsequently tackle the government's fiscal woes. GOP defense hawks are a driving force, intent on reversing the automatic cuts and getting more money for the military. A key priority for Democrats is to boost domestic programs.\u00a0</p>", "<p>The budget portion would increase the current \"caps\" on total agency spending by $50 billion in 2016 and $30 billion in 2017, offset by savings elsewhere in the budget. And it would permit about $16 billion to be added on top of that in 2016, classified as war funding, with a comparable boost in 2017.\u00a0</p>", "<p>Among the proposed spending cuts in the plan are curbs on Medicare payments for outpatient services provided by hospitals that have taken over doctors' practices, and an extension of a 2 percentage-point cut in Medicare payments to doctors through the end of a 10-year budget. It requires the sale of 58 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, cuts crop insurance payments to insurance providers and requires new auctions of spectrum to communications companies.\u00a0</p>", "<p>It also would clean up expected problems in Social Security and Medicare by fixing a shortfall looming next year in Social Security payments to the disabled, as well as a large increase in Medicare premiums and deductibles for doctors' visits and other outpatient care.\u00a0</p>", "<p><i>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</i></p>"]}

But, even as Clinton said she \"took responsibility,\" she accepted little blame for the denial of security requests before the attack, or for the faulty narrative about an anti-Islam video that formed after.\u00a0</p>", "<p>Clinton testified to the Benghazi committee that the security requests were handled by security professionals in the department and not her.\u00a0</p>", "<p>\"I did not see them. I did not approve them. I did not deny them,\" she said, while saying she was aware of the risks on the ground.\u00a0</p>", "<p>Clinton insisted Blumenthal, whose frequent messages to her turned up in recently released emails, was not a primary source of information or even technically \"advising\" her.\u00a0</p>", "<p>But when she questioned what the emails have to do with the tragedy, committee Chairman Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., contrasted the frequent and direct communication with Blumenthal against Stevens' struggle to get help.\u00a0</p>", "<p>\"I think it is eminently fair to ask why Sidney Blumethal had unfettered access to you, Madam Secretary ... and there's not a single solitary email to or from you, to or from Ambassador Stevens,\" he said.\u00a0</p>", "<p>Clinton earlier admitted that Stevens did not even have her personal email, while also claiming she didn't have a computer in her office.\u00a0</p>", "<p>\"I do not believe that he had my personal email,\" Clinton said, before adding that Stevens had a \"direct line\" to others.\u00a0</p>", "<p>Clinton acknowledged some of his requests were approved, and others were not. But she said Stevens emailed regularly with her close aides and \"did not raise security with the members of my staff.\"\u00a0</p>", "<p>The exhaustive hearing, which featured not only tough questioning of Clinton but frequent infighting between Republican and Democratic committee members, came as the former State Department leader tries to reclaim momentum in the Democratic presidential race. On Capitol Hill, she tried to settle lingering questions on her role surrounding the 2012 attacks.\u00a0</p>", "<p>Republicans suggested the investigation, though, is far from over.\u00a0</p>", "<p>In a tense exchange, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, grilled Clinton on why the administration initially seemed to blame protests over an anti-Islam film.\u00a0</p>", "<p>\"Where'd the false narrative start? It started with you, Madam Secretary,\" he charged, pointing to a State Department statement that night saying some were using the video to justify violence. Jordan said she later told the Egyptian prime minister they knew the attack was \"planned\" and had \"nothing to do with the film.\" He alleged she didn't tell the American people the \"truth.\"\u00a0</p>", "<p>But Clinton responded, \"There is no doubt in my mind that we did the best we could with the information we had at the time.\"\u00a0</p>", "<p>She said they were dealing with \"fluid\" and \"fast-moving\" and \"conflicting\" information, and stressed that the night of the attack, she only said some \"sought to justify\" the attack with the video. She said there were probably many motivations. And while former top intelligence officials have indicated they knew the attack was terrorism from the start, Clinton seemed to suggest it was the intelligence community guiding the public narrative.\u00a0</p>", "<p>\"The intelligence community did the best job they could,\" she testified.\u00a0</p>", "<p>At other times in the hearing, Clinton said Stevens had volunteered for the mission itself and said that while the risk in the region was known, \"there was no credible actionable threat known by our intelligence community against our compound.\" Clinton at times also tried to rebuff tough questioning by suggesting American agents should not be disparaged, though lawmakers did not appear to imply this.\u00a0</p>", "<p>In another tense exchange later in the evening, Rep. Susan Brooks, R-Ind., questioned if Clinton had a personal conversation with Stevens after he was sworn in that May.</p>", "<p>When Clinton initially responded \"I believe I did,\" Brooks pressed her further, saying there were no call logs or record she spoke with Stevens directly. Clinton responded again she believed she did have a conversation with Stevens before his was killed.</p>", "<p>Generally, Clinton and Democrats on the committee argued that the attack has already been thoroughly investigated, by the Accountability Review Board and other congressional panels. Democrats accused Republicans of leading a partisan hunt against Clinton to damage her presidential candidacy.\u00a0</p>", "<p>Indeed, the hearing comes at a critical time for Clinton. Following a strong debate performance last week, Clinton on Wednesday also saw the man who may have represented the biggest primary threat to her candidacy, Vice President Biden, opt out of running.\u00a0</p>", "<p>Yet questions about her personal email use and her actions relating to the Benghazi attack loom over her run.\u00a0</p>", "<p>Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., the committee's top Democrat, said the panel was only formed because Republicans \"did not like the answers\" from prior investigations. So, he said, they established the committee and \"set them loose, Madam Secretary, because you're running for president.\" Cummings called it an \"abusive effort to derail\" her campaign.\u00a0</p>", "<p>But Gowdy denied this. Of allegations that the investigation is all about Clinton, Gowdy said Thursday, \"Let me assure you it is not.\"\u00a0</p>", "<p>The former State Department leader meanwhile tried to downplay questions about what her emails did and did not show by claiming much of her work was done over phone, in person and other ways.\u00a0</p>", "<p>She said she mostly did not work over email, and said she did not have a computer in her office while secretary of state.\u00a0</p>", "<p>\"I didn't conduct the business that I did primarily on email,\" she said, adding that she generally did not email during the day.\u00a0</p>", "<p>Despite these claims, investigators are looking into a number of work-related emails Clinton sent at the department and whether they contained classified material. The emails came up under questioning from Brooks, R-Ind., who asked why so few of her emails addressed Libya in the lead-up to the attack.\u00a0</p>", "<p>At the hearing, Clinton also was challenged over her advocacy for military intervention in Libya, with a GOP member describing her as the \"architect\" of a policy that has led to \"disaster.\"\u00a0</p>", "<p>Clinton defended her role, saying she pushed for intervention to prevent \"mass massacres,\" but stressing that President Obama made the final call to use U.S. military force.\u00a0</p>", "<p>She also told the committee the night of the Benghazi attack, she only had one call with President Obama. There were no meetings or calls with then-CIA director Leon Panetta or Gen. Martin Dempsey, according to Clinton, even though she said they were \"the decision makers\" who could have sent in U.S. military forces.</p>", "<p>Clinton added that she did not talk to the survivors of the attack until they had been debriefed, and after they arrived back in U.S.</p>", "<p>\"Our Libya policy couldn't have happened without you, because you were its chief architect,\" Rep. Peter Roskam, R-Ill., told her, adding: \"Things in Libya today are a disaster.\"\u00a0</p>", "<p>Clinton said she does not \"subscribe\" to that view.\u00a0</p>", "<p>Gowdy, in explaining the purpose of the hearing, said they owe the \"truth\" about what happened to the victims of the 2012 terror attack.\u00a0</p>", "<p>\"They were more than four images on a television screen.... They were Americans who believed in service and sacrifice,\" Gowdy, R-S.C., said.\u00a0</p>", "<p>For that sacrifice, Gowdy said, \"We owe them and each other the truth.\" He said he wants a \"final definitive accounting\" of what happened.\u00a0</p>", "<p>Gowdy said that includes answers over what the U.S. was doing in Libya, what happened to requests for additional security and what the government told the public after the attacks.\u00a0</p>", "<p>In her opening statement, Clinton said she was there to \"honor the service\" of the four men who died. She argued that America \"must lead in a dangerous world\" and said it would \"compound the tragedy\" for America to \"retreat from the world.\"</p>"]}

Those decisions were your decisions, not ours.\u00a0 It was only in March of this year we learned of this email arrangement.\u00a0 Since we learned of your email arrangement we have interviewed dozens of witnesses, only one of whom was about your email arrangement, and that was a very short interview because he invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.</p>", "<p>Making sure the public record is complete is what serious investigations do.\u00a0 So, it was important to gain access to Ambassador Stevens\u2019 emails, the emails of other Sr. leaders and witnesses, and it was important to gain access to your emails.\u00a0 Your emails are no more or less important than anyone else\u2019s.\u00a0 It just took longer to get them and garnered more attention in the process.</p>", "<p>I want you to take note during this hearing how many times congressional Democrats call on this administration to make long awaited documents available.\u00a0 They won't.\u00a0 Take note of how many witnesses congressional Democrats ask us to schedule for interview.\u00a0 They won't.\u00a0 We would be much closer to finishing this investigation and writing a final report if our Democrat colleagues decided to help us pursue the facts.\u00a0 If the Democrats on this committee had their way, dozens of witnesses never would have been interviewed, tens of thousands of documents never would have been reviewed, your public record would still be private, and we would never have accessed the emails of our Ambassador.\u00a0 All of that may be smart politics, but it is not the way to run a serious investigation.\u00a0</p>", "<p>There are certain characteristics that make our country unique in the annals of history.\u00a0 We are the greatest experiment in self-governance the world has ever known.\u00a0 And part of that self-governance includes self-scrutiny - even of the highest officials.\u00a0 Our country is strong enough to handle the truth.\u00a0 And our fellow citizens expect us to pursue the truth, wherever the facts take us.\u00a0</p>", "<p>So this committee is going to do what we pledged to do, and what should have been done long ago, which is interview the witnesses, examine the relevant evidence, and access the documents.\u00a0 We are going to pursue the truth in a manner worthy of the memory of the four men who lost their lives and worthy of the respect of our fellow citizens.</p>", "<p>We are going to write that final, definitive accounting of what happened in Benghazi.\u00a0 We would like to do it with your help, but we are going to do it nonetheless.\u00a0 Because understanding what happened in Benghazi goes to the heart of who we are as a country and the promises we make to those we send into harm's way.\u00a0 They deserve the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.\u00a0 The people we work for deserve the truth.\u00a0 The family and friends of those killed representing this country deserve the truth.\u00a0 There is no statute of limitations on that truth.</p>"]}

There was no easy way to get him into Benghazi to begin gathering information and meeting those Libyans who were rising up against the murderous the dictator Qadhafi, but he found a way to get himself there on a Greek cargo ship, just like a 19th century American envoy.\u00a0 But his work was very much 21st century hard-nosed diplomacy.</p>", "<p>It is a testament to the relationships that he built in Libya that on the day following the awareness of his death, tens of thousands of Libyans poured into the streets in Benghazi. They held signs reading \"thugs don't represent Benghazi or Islam.\" \"Sorry people of America, this is not the behavior of our Islam or our Prophet.\" \"Chris Stevens, a friend to all Libyans.\"</p>", "<p>Although I didn\u2019t have the privilege of meeting Sean Smith personally, he was a valued member of our State Department family. An Air Force veteran, he was an Information Management officer, who had served in Pretoria, Baghdad, Montreal, and The Hague.</p>", "<p>Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty worked for the CIA. They were killed by mortar fire at the CIA's outpost in Benghazi, a short distance from the diplomatic compound. They were both former Navy SEALs and trained paramedics with distinguished records of service, including in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>", "<p>As Secretary of State, I had the honor to lead and the responsibility to support nearly 70,000 diplomats and development experts across the globe.</p>", "<p>Losing any one of them, as we did in Iraq, Afghanistan, Mexico, Haiti, and Libya during my tenure, was deeply painful for our entire State Department and USAID family, and for me personally.</p>", "<p>I was the one who asked Chris to go to Libya as our envoy. I was the one who recommended him to be our Ambassador to to the President.</p>", "<p>After the attacks, I stood next to President Obama as Marines carried his casket and those of the other three Americans off the plane at Andrews Air Force Base.</p>", "<p>I took responsibility.\u00a0 And, as part of that, before I left office, I launched reforms to better protect our people in the field and help reduce the chance of another tragedy happening in the future.</p>", "<p>What happened in Benghazi has been scrutinized by a nonpartisan, hard-hitting Accountability Review Board, seven prior Congressional investigations, multiple news organizations, and, of course, our law enforcement and intelligence agencies.</p>", "<p>So today I would like to share three observations about how we can learn from this tragedy and move forward as a nation.</p>", "<p>First, America must lead in a dangerous world, and our diplomats must continue representing us in dangerous places.</p>", "<p>The State Department sends people to more than 270 posts in 170 countries around the world.</p>", "<p>Chris Stevens understood that diplomats must operate in many places where our soldiers do not, where there are no other boots on the ground, and safety is far from guaranteed.\u00a0 In fact, he volunteered for just those assignments.</p>", "<p>He also understood we will never prevent every act of terrorism or achieve perfect security, and that we inevitably must accept a level of risk to protect our country and advance our interests and values.</p>", "<p>And make no mistake: the risks are real.\u00a0 Terrorists have killed more than sixty-five American diplomatic personnel since the 1970s and more than a hundred contractors and locally employed staff.</p>", "<p>Since 2001, there have been more than one hundred attacks on U.S. diplomatic facilities around the world.</p>", "<p>But if you ask our most experienced ambassadors, they\u2019ll tell you they can\u2019t do their jobs for us from bunkers.</p>", "<p>It would compound the tragedy of Benghazi if Chris Stevens\u2019 death and the death of the other three Americans ended up undermining the work to which he and they devoted their lives.</p>", "<p>We have learned the hard way when America is absent, especially from unstable places, there are consequences.\u00a0 Extremism takes root, aggressors seek to fill the vacuum, and security everywhere is threatened, including here at home.</p>", "<p>That\u2019s why Chris was in Benghazi.\u00a0 It\u2019s why he had served previously in Syria, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Jerusalem during the second intifada.</p>", "<p>Nobody knew the dangers of Libya better -- a weak government, extremist groups, rampant instability. But Chris chose to go to Benghazi because he understood America had to be represented there at that pivotal time.</p>", "<p>He knew that eastern Libya was where the revolution had begun and that unrest there could derail the country\u2019s fragile transition to democracy.\u00a0 And if extremists gained a foothold, they would have the chance to destabilize the entire region, including Egypt and Tunisia.</p>", "<p>He also knew how urgent it was to ensure that the weapons Qadhafi had left strewn across the country, including shoulder-fired missiles that could knock an airplane out of the sky, did not fall into the wrong hands.\u00a0 The nearest Israeli airport is just a day\u2019s drive from the Libyan border.</p>", "<p>Above all, Chris understood that most people, in Libya or anywhere, reject the extremists\u2019 argument that violence can ever be a path to dignity or justice. That's what those thousands of Libyans were saying after they learned of his death. He understood there was no substitute for going beyond the Embassy walls and doing the hard work of building relationships.</p>", "<p>Retreat from the world is not an option.\u00a0 America cannot shrink from our responsibility to lead.\u00a0 That doesn\u2019t mean we should ever return to the go-it-alone foreign policy of the past, a foreign policy that puts boots on the ground as a first choice rather than a last resort.\u00a0 Quite the opposite.</p>", "<p>We need creative, confident leadership that harnesses all of America\u2019s strengths and values.\u00a0 Leadership that integrates and balances the tools of diplomacy, development, and defense.</p>", "<p>And at the heart of that effort must be dedicated professionals like Chris Stevens and his colleagues, who put their lives on the line for a country\u2014our country\u2014because they believed \u2013 as I do \u2013 that America is the greatest force for peace and progress the world has ever known.</p>", "<p>My second observation is this:\u00a0 We have a responsibility to provide our diplomats with the resources and support they need to do their jobs as safely and effectively as possible.</p>", "<p>After previous deadly attacks, leaders from both parties and both branches of government came together to determine what went wrong and how to fix it for the future.\u00a0 That\u2019s what happened during the Reagan administration, when Hezbollah attacked our embassy. They killed 63 people, including 17 Americans. And then in a later attack, attacked our Marine barracks and killed so many more. Those two attacks in Beirut resulted in the deaths of 258 Americans.</p>", "<p>It\u2019s what happened during the Clinton administration when al Qaeda bombed our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, killing more than two hundred people, wounding more than two thousand people, and killing twelve Americans.\u00a0 It\u2019s what happened during the Bush administration after 9/11.</p>", "<p>Part of America's strength is we learn, we adapt, and we get stronger.</p>", "<p>After the Benghazi attacks, I asked Ambassador Thomas Pickering, one of our most distinguished and longest-serving diplomats, along with Admiral Mike Mullen, the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff appointed by President George W. Bush, to lead an Accountability Review Board. This is an institution that the Congress set up after the terrible attacks in Beirut. There have been eighteen previous Accountability Review Boards. Only two have ever made any of their findings public. The one following the attacks on our embassies in East Africa and the one following the attack on Benghazi. The Accountability Review Board did not pull a single punch. They found systemic problems and management deficiencies in two State Department bureaus.</p>", "<p>And the Review Board recommended twenty-nine specific improvements.\u00a0 I pledged that by the time I left office, every one would be on the way to implementation.\u00a0 And they were.\u00a0 More Marines were slated for deployment to high-threat embassies.\u00a0 Additional Diplomatic Security agents were being hired and trained.</p>", "<p>And Secretary Kerry has continued this work.\u00a0 But there is more to do.\u00a0 And no administration can do it alone.\u00a0 Congress has to be our partner, as it has been after previous tragedies.</p>", "<p>For example, the Accountability Review Board and subsequent investigations have recommended improved training for our officers before they deploy to the field.\u00a0 But efforts to establish a modern joint training center are being held up by Congress. The men and women who serve our country deserve better.</p>", "<p>Finally, there is one more observation I\u2019d like to share:</p>", "<p>I traveled to 112 countries as Secretary of State. Every time I did, I felt great pride and honor representing the country that I love. We need leadership at home to match our leadership abroad.\u00a0 Leadership that puts national security ahead of politics and ideology.</p>", "<p>Our nation has a long history of bipartisan cooperation on foreign policy and national security.\u00a0 Not that we always agree \u2014 far from it \u2014 but we do come together when it counts.</p>", "<p>As Secretary of State, I worked with the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to pass a landmark nuclear arms control treaty with Russia.\u00a0 I worked with Republican Leader, Senator Mitch McConnell, to open up Burma, now Myanmar, to find democratic change.</p>", "<p>I know it\u2019s possible to find common ground, because I have done it.</p>", "<p>We should debate on the basis of fact, not fear.\u00a0 We should resist denigrating the patriotism or loyalty of those with who we disagree.</p>", "<p>So I am here. Despite all the previous investigations and all the talk about partisan agendas, I am here to honor those we lost and to do what I can to aid those who serve us still.</p>", "<p>And my challenge to you, members of this Committee, is the same challenge I put to myself.</p>", "<p>Let\u2019s be worthy of the trust the American people have bestowed upon us.\u00a0 They expect us to lead. To learn the right lessons.\u00a0 To rise above partisanship and to reach for statesmanship.</p>", "<p>That\u2019s what I tried to do every day as Secretary of State.\u00a0 And it\u2019s what I hope we all strive for here today and into the future. Thank you.\u201d</p>"]}

But, even as Clinton said she \"took responsibility,\" she accepted little blame for the denial of security requests before the attack, or for the faulty narrative about an anti-Islam video that formed after.\u00a0</p>", "<p>Clinton testified to the Benghazi committee that the security requests were handled by security professionals in the department and not her.\u00a0</p>", "<p>\"I did not see them. I did not approve them. I did not deny them,\" she said, while saying she was aware of the risks on the ground.\u00a0</p>", "<p>Clinton insisted Blumenthal, whose frequent messages to her turned up in recently released emails, was not a primary source of information or even technically \"advising\" her.\u00a0</p>", "<p>But when she questioned what the emails have to do with the tragedy, committee Chairman Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., contrasted the frequent and direct communication with Blumenthal against Stevens' struggle to get help.\u00a0</p>", "<p>\"I think it is eminently fair to ask why Sidney Blumethal had unfettered access to you, Madam Secretary ... and there's not a single solitary email to or from you, to or from Ambassador Stevens,\" he said.\u00a0</p>", "<p>Clinton earlier admitted that Stevens did not even have her personal email, while also claiming she didn't have a computer in her office.\u00a0</p>", "<p>\"I do not believe that he had my personal email,\" Clinton said, before adding that Stevens had a \"direct line\" to others.\u00a0</p>", "<p>Clinton acknowledged some of his requests were approved, and others were not. But she said Stevens emailed regularly with her close aides and \"did not raise security with the members of my staff.\"\u00a0</p>", "<p>The exhaustive hearing, which featured not only tough questioning of Clinton but frequent infighting between Republican and Democratic committee members, came as the former State Department leader tries to reclaim momentum in the Democratic presidential race. On Capitol Hill, she tried to settle lingering questions on her role surrounding the 2012 attacks.\u00a0</p>", "<p>Republicans suggested the investigation, though, is far from over.\u00a0</p>", "<p>In a tense exchange, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, grilled Clinton on why the administration initially seemed to blame protests over an anti-Islam film.\u00a0</p>", "<p>\"Where'd the false narrative start? It started with you, Madam Secretary,\" he charged, pointing to a State Department statement that night saying some were using the video to justify violence. Jordan said she later told the Egyptian prime minister they knew the attack was \"planned\" and had \"nothing to do with the film.\" He alleged she didn't tell the American people the \"truth.\"\u00a0</p>", "<p>But Clinton responded, \"There is no doubt in my mind that we did the best we could with the information we had at the time.\"\u00a0</p>", "<p>She said they were dealing with \"fluid\" and \"fast-moving\" and \"conflicting\" information, and stressed that the night of the attack, she only said some \"sought to justify\" the attack with the video. She said there were probably many motivations. And while former top intelligence officials have indicated they knew the attack was terrorism from the start, Clinton seemed to suggest it was the intelligence community guiding the public narrative.\u00a0</p>", "<p>\"The intelligence community did the best job they could,\" she testified.\u00a0</p>", "<p>At other times in the hearing, Clinton said Stevens had volunteered for the mission itself and said that while the risk in the region was known, \"there was no credible actionable threat known by our intelligence community against our compound.\" Clinton at times also tried to rebuff tough questioning by suggesting American agents should not be disparaged, though lawmakers did not appear to imply this.\u00a0</p>", "<p>In another tense exchange later in the evening, Rep. Susan Brooks, R-Ind., questioned if Clinton had a personal conversation with Stevens after he was sworn in that May.</p>", "<p>When Clinton initially responded \"I believe I did,\" Brooks pressed her further, saying there were no call logs or record she spoke with Stevens directly. Clinton responded again she believed she did have a conversation with Stevens before his was killed.</p>", "<p>Generally, Clinton and Democrats on the committee argued that the attack has already been thoroughly investigated, by the Accountability Review Board and other congressional panels. Democrats accused Republicans of leading a partisan hunt against Clinton to damage her presidential candidacy.\u00a0</p>", "<p>Indeed, the hearing comes at a critical time for Clinton. Following a strong debate performance last week, Clinton on Wednesday also saw the man who may have represented the biggest primary threat to her candidacy, Vice President Biden, opt out of running.\u00a0</p>", "<p>Yet questions about her personal email use and her actions relating to the Benghazi attack loom over her run.\u00a0</p>", "<p>Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., the committee's top Democrat, said the panel was only formed because Republicans \"did not like the answers\" from prior investigations. So, he said, they established the committee and \"set them loose, Madam Secretary, because you're running for president.\" Cummings called it an \"abusive effort to derail\" her campaign.\u00a0</p>", "<p>But Gowdy denied this. Of allegations that the investigation is all about Clinton, Gowdy said Thursday, \"Let me assure you it is not.\"\u00a0</p>", "<p>The former State Department leader meanwhile tried to downplay questions about what her emails did and did not show by claiming much of her work was done over phone, in person and other ways.\u00a0</p>", "<p>She said she mostly did not work over email, and said she did not have a computer in her office while secretary of state.\u00a0</p>", "<p>\"I didn't conduct the business that I did primarily on email,\" she said, adding that she generally did not email during the day.\u00a0</p>", "<p>Despite these claims, investigators are looking into a number of work-related emails Clinton sent at the department and whether they contained classified material. The emails came up under questioning from Brooks, R-Ind., who asked why so few of her emails addressed Libya in the lead-up to the attack.\u00a0</p>", "<p>At the hearing, Clinton also was challenged over her advocacy for military intervention in Libya, with a GOP member describing her as the \"architect\" of a policy that has led to \"disaster.\"\u00a0</p>", "<p>Clinton defended her role, saying she pushed for intervention to prevent \"mass massacres,\" but stressing that President Obama made the final call to use U.S. military force.\u00a0</p>", "<p>She also told the committee the night of the Benghazi attack, she only had one call with President Obama. There were no meetings or calls with then-CIA director Leon Panetta or Gen. Martin Dempsey, according to Clinton, even though she said they were \"the decision makers\" who could have sent in U.S. military forces.</p>", "<p>Clinton added that she did not talk to the survivors of the attack until they had been debriefed, and after they arrived back in U.S.</p>", "<p>\"Our Libya policy couldn't have happened without you, because you were its chief architect,\" Rep. Peter Roskam, R-Ill., told her, adding: \"Things in Libya today are a disaster.\"\u00a0</p>", "<p>Clinton said she does not \"subscribe\" to that view.\u00a0</p>", "<p>Gowdy, in explaining the purpose of the hearing, said they owe the \"truth\" about what happened to the victims of the 2012 terror attack.\u00a0</p>", "<p>\"They were more than four images on a television screen.... They were Americans who believed in service and sacrifice,\" Gowdy, R-S.C., said.\u00a0</p>", "<p>For that sacrifice, Gowdy said, \"We owe them and each other the truth.\" He said he wants a \"final definitive accounting\" of what happened.\u00a0</p>", "<p>Gowdy said that includes answers over what the U.S. was doing in Libya, what happened to requests for additional security and what the government told the public after the attacks.\u00a0</p>", "<p>In her opening statement, Clinton said she was there to \"honor the service\" of the four men who died. She argued that America \"must lead in a dangerous world\" and said it would \"compound the tragedy\" for America to \"retreat from the world.\"</p>"]}

The House voted to send Obama a bill to defund Planned Parenthood and repeal ObamaCare \u2013 even though lawmakers knew he would veto it. House and Senate Republicans then jumped buses for an issues retreat in Baltimore.</p>", "<p>Then it was the House\u2019s turn to take off last week. The Senate had a few procedural votes and an important hearing on the nomination of Eric Fanning to lead the Army. But then the Senate skedaddled just in time for the storm. As the first the flakes fell, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., announced that the House of Representatives wouldn\u2019t hold any votes on Monday. The storm would make it too hard for lawmakers to jet back into town. Airline schedules would be topsy-turvy and it would take a few days to recover.</p>", "<p>Over the weekend, McCarthy then postponed all votes for this week. It was supposed to be a short week anyway. This time, House Democrats were trekking to Baltimore for their annual retreat and to hear from Obama and Vice President Biden, among others.</p>", "<p>The House had planned to revote a bill to dump sanctions on Iran this week. The House originally approved the measure two weeks ago. But House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., is enforcing time discipline in the House -- 137 lawmakers were late and missed the vote, so House GOP leadership agreed to nullify the result and vote again. But with weather snarling all modes of traffic in and out of Washington, a lot more than 137 members would have missed the vote early this week. The House was also scheduled to vote to override Obama\u2019s veto of the ObamaCare repeal/Planned Parenthood defund legislation this week. But that\u2019s off the books now, too.</p>", "<p>The Senate punted the confirmation vote of John Vazquez to serve on the federal bench in New Jersey from Tuesday night until Wednesday night.

The House also won\u2019t meet from Oct. 1 through Nov. 14. And then it takes a week for Thanksgiving. So just five weeks of session between July 15 and Nov. 29 \u2013 when the House convenes after the Thanksgiving recess.</p>", "<p>Now to be fair, days in session is not a good rubric to measure the productivity of Congress. Nor is the number of bills the House and Senate may pass. Lawmakers work constantly, attending to issues in their districts, talking to constituents and working the phones. It can be a 24/7 job. On multiple occasions, former House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said people should judge Congress \u201con how many laws we repeal\u201d versus \u201chow many new laws\u201d lawmakers pass. This was a take on a saying by President Calvin Coolidge: \u201cIt is much more important to kill bad bills than to pass good ones.\u201d</p>", "<p>It\u2019s kind of like statistics in baseball. Does a guy crack 30 home runs but none in the clutch? Or how valuable is a guy who hits .300 with runners in scoring position? What\u2019s his WAR?</p>", "<p>Like Major League Baseball, there are statistics inside the statistics when it comes to Congress. We haven\u2019t even addressed the important work Congress does with oversight, investigations and hearings. As the expression goes, not everything that counts can be counted and vice-versa. But, you can imagine the metric that the general public uses to gauge congressional success or failure. There\u2019s a skepticism when they see a schedule like the one published for this calendar year.</p>", "<p>Keep in mind, this week\u2019s schedule alterations were out of necessity. The word Congress means \u201ccoming together.\u201d If half the East Coast is paralyzed by a record-setting blizzard with anywhere from a foot to three feet of snow on the ground, people aren\u2019t going to \u201ccome together.\u201d</p>", "<p>Cue the Beatles.</p>", "<p>The headlines popped this fall when Ryan announced his candidacy for speaker. He said Congress needed an \u201cambitious\u201d agenda. Yet, one might question how lawmakers can tackle a broad agenda with such little time on the calendar.</p>", "<p>Of course, some would prefer Congress not meet much at all. Gideon John Tucker, a mid-19<sup>th</sup> Century attorney, once worked on a case involving a will -- and famously declared \u201cno man\u2019s life, liberty or property are safe while the legislature is in session.\u201d</p>", "<p>Congress hasn\u2019t been around much to start 2016.

He understood there was no substitute for going beyond the Embassy walls and doing the hard work of building relationships.</p>", "<p>Retreat from the world is not an option.\u00a0 America cannot shrink from our responsibility to lead.\u00a0 That doesn\u2019t mean we should ever return to the go-it-alone foreign policy of the past, a foreign policy that puts boots on the ground as a first choice rather than a last resort.\u00a0 Quite the opposite.</p>", "<p>We need creative, confident leadership that harnesses all of America\u2019s strengths and values.\u00a0 Leadership that integrates and balances the tools of diplomacy, development, and defense.</p>", "<p>And at the heart of that effort must be dedicated professionals like Chris Stevens and his colleagues, who put their lives on the line for a country\u2014our country\u2014because they believed \u2013 as I do \u2013 that America is the greatest force for peace and progress the world has ever known.</p>", "<p>My second observation is this:\u00a0 We have a responsibility to provide our diplomats with the resources and support they need to do their jobs as safely and effectively as possible.</p>", "<p>After previous deadly attacks, leaders from both parties and both branches of government came together to determine what went wrong and how to fix it for the future.\u00a0 That\u2019s what happened during the Reagan administration, when Hezbollah attacked our embassy. They killed 63 people, including 17 Americans. And then in a later attack, attacked our Marine barracks and killed so many more. Those two attacks in Beirut resulted in the deaths of 258 Americans.</p>", "<p>It\u2019s what happened during the Clinton administration when al Qaeda bombed our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, killing more than two hundred people, wounding more than two thousand people, and killing twelve Americans.\u00a0 It\u2019s what happened during the Bush administration after 9/11.</p>", "<p>Part of America's strength is we learn, we adapt, and we get stronger.</p>", "<p>After the Benghazi attacks, I asked Ambassador Thomas Pickering, one of our most distinguished and longest-serving diplomats, along with Admiral Mike Mullen, the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff appointed by President George W. Bush, to lead an Accountability Review Board. This is an institution that the Congress set up after the terrible attacks in Beirut. There have been eighteen previous Accountability Review Boards. Only two have ever made any of their findings public. The one following the attacks on our embassies in East Africa and the one following the attack on Benghazi. The Accountability Review Board did not pull a single punch. They found systemic problems and management deficiencies in two State Department bureaus.</p>", "<p>And the Review Board recommended twenty-nine specific improvements.\u00a0 I pledged that by the time I left office, every one would be on the way to implementation.\u00a0 And they were.\u00a0 More Marines were slated for deployment to high-threat embassies.\u00a0 Additional Diplomatic Security agents were being hired and trained.</p>", "<p>And Secretary Kerry has continued this work.\u00a0 But there is more to do.\u00a0 And no administration can do it alone.\u00a0 Congress has to be our partner, as it has been after previous tragedies.</p>", "<p>For example, the Accountability Review Board and subsequent investigations have recommended improved training for our officers before they deploy to the field.\u00a0 But efforts to establish a modern joint training center are being held up by Congress. The men and women who serve our country deserve better.</p>", "<p>Finally, there is one more observation I\u2019d like to share:</p>", "<p>I traveled to 112 countries as Secretary of State. Every time I did, I felt great pride and honor representing the country that I love. We need leadership at home to match our leadership abroad.\u00a0 Leadership that puts national security ahead of politics and ideology.</p>", "<p>Our nation has a long history of bipartisan cooperation on foreign policy and national security.\u00a0 Not that we always agree \u2014 far from it \u2014 but we do come together when it counts.</p>", "<p>As Secretary of State, I worked with the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to pass a landmark nuclear arms control treaty with Russia.\u00a0 I worked with Republican Leader, Senator Mitch McConnell, to open up Burma, now Myanmar, to find democratic change.</p>", "<p>I know it\u2019s possible to find common ground, because I have done it.</p>", "<p>We should debate on the basis of fact, not fear.\u00a0 We should resist denigrating the patriotism or loyalty of those with who we disagree.</p>", "<p>So I am here. Despite all the previous investigations and all the talk about partisan agendas, I am here to honor those we lost and to do what I can to aid those who serve us still.</p>", "<p>And my challenge to you, members of this Committee, is the same challenge I put to myself.</p>", "<p>Let\u2019s be worthy of the trust the American people have bestowed upon us.\u00a0 They expect us to lead. To learn the right lessons.\u00a0 To rise above partisanship and to reach for statesmanship.</p>", "<p>That\u2019s what I tried to do every day as Secretary of State.\u00a0 And it\u2019s what I hope we all strive for here today and into the future. Thank you.\u201d</p>"]}

John Culberson, R-Texas, who chairs a key appropriations panel, warned Lynch on Monday that he would \u201cuse every tool at my disposal to immediately restrict\u201d DOJ funding if the department proceeds with \u201cnew restrictions on our Constitutional rights.\u201d</p>", "<p>Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump vowed to reverse any such actions if he\u2019s elected.</p>", "<p>\"We're not changing the Second Amendment,\" Trump said Saturday at a campaign rally in Biloxi, Miss. \"I will veto that. I will un-sign that so fast.\"</p>", "<p>While Obama did not detail the proposals, a priority is an effort to expand background checks on gun sales by forcing more sellers to register as federally licensed gun dealers. The changes would be aimed at some unregistered sellers who skirt the background check laws by selling at gun shows, online or informal settings. Other moves being considered include improving reporting of lost and stolen weapons and beefing up inspections of licensed dealers, according to a person familiar with the plans.</p>", "<p>The package includes measures this White House has long considered but not completed, mindful of the legal fight sure to follow as well as the potential for political backlash for some fellow Democrats.</p>", "<p>While Obama took heat from Republicans, supporters of stronger action on gun control applauded the president\u2019s new push.</p>", "<p>\"We definitely think there are things he can do,\" said Dan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, which advocates for expanding background checks. Gross says his recent conversations with White House aides have left him hopeful.</p>", "<p>\"It's very clear that the White House is feeling emboldened,\" he said.</p>", "<p>Obama announced the meeting with Lynch in his weekly address from his Hawaii holiday vacation. On Thursday, he'll take his argument to prime time, participating in a town hall discussion of gun violence on CNN. He's slated to make his case for changes in his State of the Union address on Jan. 12.</p>", "<p>The high-profile rollout reflects a White House continuing to look for ways to wrap up unfinished business, despite an uncooperative Congress.</p>", "<p>After all but ignoring the issue in his first term, Obama changed course after the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary in December 2012. Nevertheless, the president failed to push a package of gun measures through Congress, including one expanding background checks.</p>", "<p>At the same time, Obama took nearly two dozen executive actions to tighten gun laws, but left a major expansion of background checks out of the mix.</p>", "<p>But after the shooting at a community college in Roseburg, Oregon in October, Obama ordered his staff to redouble the effort to look for ways to work around Congress.</p>", "<p>Under current law, federally licensed firearms dealers are required to seek background checks on potential firearm purchasers. But advocacy groups say many sellers are currently exempt from having to register, increasing the chance of sales to customers prohibited by law from purchasing a gun.</p>", "<p>The administration is expected to reclassify some of those dealers using a mix of criteria, such as the number and frequency of guns sold, whether sellers profit off sales, whether they advertise, rent space or tables at gun shows and pay taxes.</p>", "<p><i>The Associated Press contributed to this report.\u00a0</i></p>"]}

So close that it\u2019s too close to call. \u00a0It\u2019s a \u201cvirtual tie.\u201d</p>", "<p>Since late Monday night there has been less than half a percentage point separating Hillary Clinton from Bernie Sanders in Iowa \u2013 the man who was upwards of 30 points behind her not too long ago.</p>", "<p>I was never part of the media chorus that referred to Clinton as the anointed one. After what happened in 2008, the Clinton campaign wouldn\u2019t take anything for granted \u2013 even a 74-year old Democratic socialist.</p>", "<p>Monday night\u2019s results show just how much momentum Sanders has built. He will certainly add to his incredible fundraising effort in January where he pulled in $20 million in small donations with an average donation of $27. \u00a0</p>", "<p>And as we move to New Hampshire \u2013 where Clinton will almost certainly lose as she continues to trail Sanders by 20-points in some polls \u2013 Sanders has a strong case for the passion of the party being with his campaign, just as he argued in his speech Monday evening.</p>", "<p>But he\u2019s about to run up against one of the strongest parts of the Clinton firewall: South Carolina.</p>", "<p>Clinton is overwhelmingly popular with African-Americans, just as her husband was. Even though Sanders has made inroads with figures of the black community as of late \u2013 he recently received the endorsement of Eric Garner\u2019s daughter, for instance \u2013 I don\u2019t think that he was correct when he said that he can chip away at her lead like he did in Iowa in the South and the West. \u00a0</p>", "<p>South Carolina and the Super Tuesday states are very different demographically and politically. Furthermore, some of Clinton\u2019s best numbers come from her support with minorities.</p>", "<p>Just days ago, 28 \u00a0black ministers endorsed her and she leads Sanders 63 percent to 20 percent and is up 54 percent to 33 percent with Latino voters.</p>", "<p>We know that she won\u2019t be able to rebuild the Obama coalition, but she should handily win these groups who have a long history of supporting her, not something that can be easily undone.</p>", "<p>But that doesn\u2019t mean that Monday night was by any means a great night for Hillary. Even if she is named the eventual winner, her victory in Iowa should be classified as something she <i>survived </i>rather than anything else.</p>", "<p>It follows that she\u2019s going to have to treat each and every primary as she did with Iowa, even where she has a big lead.</p>", "<p>Her path to the nomination remains clear, but Sanders is giving her more of a race than anyone could\u2019ve predicted (except Sanders, of course). <a name=\"_GoBack\"></a></p>", "<p><i>Douglas E.

It operates in a climate of arrogance that is still unchecked to this day.</p>", "<p>Last year, investigators revealed that nearly 1,600 IRS employees \u2013 those responsible for enforcing our tax laws \u2013 actually willfully evaded paying their own taxes for up to a decade. And in some cases, these employees even received promotions and bonuses.</p>", "<p>And what\u2019s equally disturbing: a new <a href=\"http://dailycaller.com/2016/01/28/irss-new-ethics-chief-once-ordered-records-be-illegally-destroyed/\" target=\"_blank\">report</a> that reveals the new head of the agency\u2019s ethics office \u201conce oversaw the illegal shredding of documents sought by the federal tax agency\u2019s inspector general (IG). . .\u201d</p>", "<p>In addition, several members of a newly-appointed leadership team inside the IRS \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/Tax-Professionals/Enrolled-Agents/The-Office-of-Professional-Responsibility-(OPR)-At-a-Glance-1\" target=\"_blank\">The Office of Professional Responsibility</a> \u2013 used to work for former top IRS official Lois Lerner \u2013 who was at the center of the illegal targeting scheme.

If we don\u2019t do something about it before it\u2019s too late, we risk a dangerous transformation -- from a nation of laws into a nation of men and women corrupted by power and incapable of justice.</p>", "<p>We continue the important work to reform the broken system. This requires long-term strategy and diligence, building coalitions and establishing and strengthening institutions that impact our culture. So elections can succeed in giving us representatives and leaders who fear the people instead of instilling fear in the people.</p>", "<p>These fights are important.

Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has suddenly scrambled to announce an \u201cexternal, independent review\u201d panel to examine that issue, along with \u201ca broad range of systemic issues related to how the U.N. responds to serious information of this kind.\u201d</p>", "<p>Ban, who declared himself \u201cdeeply disturbed\u201d by the situation, said on Wednesday his intent was \u201cto ensure that the United Nations does not fail the victims of sexual abuse, especially when committed by those who are meant to protect them.\u201d</p>", "<p>In fact, Fox News has learned, Ban\u2019s action was also urged on him two days earlier by U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Samantha Power, as U.N. member states dickered in committee over a resolution that criticized Ban for the \u201cperceived lack of timely information\u201d he had provided on the abuse issue and the \u201clack of protection of whistleblower\u201d associated with the CAR incidents.</p>", "<p>At the time of Ban\u2019s announcement, U.S. and European diplomats were still offering up alternative wordings in committee to temper the harsher language.</p>", "<p>Ban\u2019s spokesman, Stephane Dujarric, told Fox News that \u201cthe need to set up such a review has been in discussion for a long time,\u201d but the specific terms of reference of the inquiry and its membership were not revealed in Ban\u2019s announcement, though he did specify it would look into \u201cthe treatment of the specific report of abuse in the Central African Republic.\u201d \u00a0</p>", "<p>According to Dujarric, both the terms of reference and the membership of the probe will be revealed \u201cas soon as possible\u201d \u2013a fairly clear indication that Ban\u2019s sparse announcement was intended more as an initial fire-fighting gesture than a fully-planned response to the sex-abuse crisis. \u00a0</p>", "<p>Another way to look at it is that the U.N.\u2019s top bureaucrat was trying to keep the explosive sex abuse issue from spinning further out of control, amid a gout of document leaks, finger-pointing and U.N. investigations criticized as focused on hushing up leakers than on protecting additional young and starving children in the war-torn CAR from rape, sodomy and other predatory offenses.</p>", "<p>Moreover, the CAR controversy is only the latest crest in a swelling critique of the U.N.\u2019s ability to protect the innocent from sex abuse where its blue-and-white flag is flying\u2014a critique that includes a long-suppressed report of U.N.-appointed experts <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/world/2015/03/27/un-peacekeeping-and-rape-getting-betteror-worse/\">who have decried a \u201cculture of impunity\u201d</a> in U.N. peacekeeping missions when it comes to such crimes.\u00a0</p>", "<p>The latest controversy has been further fueled by U.N. document leaks that raised the possibility of retaliatory collusion by the organization\u2019s independent Ethics Officer; the head of its main independent internal watchdog, the Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS); the U.N.\u2019s High Commissioner for Human Rights; and Ban\u2019s top deputy against Anders Kompass, a senior U.N. human rights official who first brought the Central African Republic scandal into the daylight.</p>", "<p>That interpretation was strenuously denied by one senior U.N. official, who requested anonymity, while for her part, the U.N. \u00a0Ethics Officer, Joan Dubinsky, declined comment saying \u201cI don\u2019t believe it is appropriate to comment on leaked documents.\u201d</p>", "<p>U.N. spokesman Dujarric told Fox News that an investigation of Kompass by OIOS for \u201cpossible staff misconduct,\u201d initiated in March, would nonetheless continue in parallel with the still-unformed inquiry panel. \u201cAny relevant information of a broad systemic nature that will come out of that investigation will be considered by the review,\u201d he declared.</p>", "<p>Kompass has already been asked to resign at the behest of the U.N.\u2019s High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra\u2019ad Al Hussein. He refused.</p>", "<p>Kompass was then briefly suspended from his work\u2014until a U.N. tribunal reversed the action-- in conjunction with his investigation by OIOS for passing on transcripts by U.N.-collected testimony from children who described their sexual abuse and exploitation by French and African peacekeepers in the chaos-shattered CAR in 2013 and 2014. The children were aged from 9 to 13.</p>", "<p>The troops were from a multinational contingent that preceded the current U.N. peacekeeping mission in CAR\u2014the U.N. forces took over in September 2015-- but were operating with U.N. Security Council approval. \u00a0</p>", "<p>Kompass got the U.N. report on the childrens\u2019 testimony on July 15, 2014. He told a French diplomat about it roughly a week later, and in a written declaration has said he told his immediate superior in the U.N.\u2019s Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) about his disclosure \u201cshortly thereafter.\u201d</p>", "<p>Kompass has subsequently made no secret of the fact that he passed on the raw testimony to French military authorities by the end of that month, bypassing his own superiors, who said they discovered the action when French investigators approached the U.N. \u00a0It was more than eight months later that he was asked to resign.</p>", "<p>In a wave of claims and counter-claims, U.N. and French officials have each blamed the other for delays in investigating the allegations, but while the U.N. has claimed that it has cooperated fully, its interviewers only answered written questions from the French military probers.</p>", "<p>The investigative waters were roiled even further with the publication of internal emails and documents that showed top U.N. officials, including Ethics Office head Dubinsky, along with OIOS head Carman LaPointe, Zaid, and Ban\u2019s chef de cabinet, Susana Malcorra, grappling with how to cope with the Kompass actions.</p>", "<p>The documents were published by a non-government organization named AIDS-Free World, as part of a campaign called Code Blue.

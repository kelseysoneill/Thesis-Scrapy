The revelation comes just three days before the Iowa presidential nominating caucuses in which Clinton is a candidate.</p>", "<p>The State Department released the latest batch of emails from Clinton's time as secretary of state on Friday evening. But seven email chains are being withheld in full because they contain information deemed to be \"top secret.\" The 37 pages include messages recently described by a key intelligence official as concerning so-called \"special access programs\" - a highly restricted subset of classified material that could point to confidential sources or clandestine programs like drone strikes or government eavesdropping.</p>", "<p>Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon on Friday indicated on Twitter that the campaign wants all of the emails at least partially released:</p>", "<p>In a longer statement, Fallon said the process of vetting the emails \"has been dominated by bureaucratic infighting\" and that the question of classification comes down to an \"interagency dispute.\"</p>", "<p>The decision to keep 22 emails secret \"flies in the face of the fact that  these emails were unmarked at the time they were sent, and have been called 'innocuous' by certain intelligence officials,\" Fallon continued. \"We understand that these emails were likely originated on the State  Department's unclassified system before they were ever shared with  Secretary Clinton, and they have remained on the department's  unclassified system for years. And, in at least one case, the emails appear to involve information from a published news article.\"</p>", "<p>Department officials wouldn't describe the substance of the emails, or say if Clinton sent any herself. However, State Department spokesman John Kirby clarified Friday, \"The documents are being upgraded at the request of the Intelligence Community... These documents were not marked classified at the time they were sent.\"</p>", "<p>Kirby told the AP that the decision to withhold documents in full as \"not unusual.\" That means they won't be published online with the rest of the documents, even with blacked-out boxes.</p>", "<p><a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/hillary-clinton-had-emails-on-server-more-classified-than-top-secret/\"></a> </p>", "<p>Clinton, the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, has insisted she never sent or received information on her personal email account that was classified at the time. No emails released so far were stamped \"CLASSIFIED\" or \"TOP SECRET,\" but reviewers previously had <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/state-department-releases-more-hillary-clinton-emails-marked-classified/\">designated more than 1,000 messages at lower classification levels for public release</a>. Friday's will be the first at the top secret level.</p>", "<p>For those emails that Clinton only read, and didn't write or forward, she still would have been required to report classification slippages that she recognized. But without classification markings, that may have been difficult, especially if the information was in the public domain.</p>", "<p>Kirby said the State Department's focus as part of the Freedom of Information Act review of Clinton's emails was on \"whether they need to be classified today.\" Questions about their past classification, he said, \"are being, and will be, handled separately by the State Department.\"</p>", "<p>Possible responses for classification infractions include counseling, warnings or other action, State Department officials said, though they declined to say if these applied to Clinton or senior aides who've since left the department. The officials weren't authorized to speak on the matter and spoke on condition of anonymity.</p>", "<p>Kirby also noted Friday that emails that Clinton exchanged with President Obama will not be released. Specifically, 18 emails comprised of eight distinct email chains between Clinton and the president are being withheld in full from the State Department's Friday email release. </p>", "<p>\"Secretary Clinton and the president did on occasion exchange emails,\" Kirby said. \"Such presidential records shall remain confidential to protect the president's ability to receive unvarnished advice and counsel but will ultimately be released in accordance with the Presidential Records Act.\"</p>", "<p>Friday's release comes at an awkward time for Clinton. The Iowa caucus is on Feb. 1, and her main challenger, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, is running neck and neck with her in the polls there and leads solidly in New Hampshire. Clinton still holds a strong advantage in national polls.</p>", "<p>Sanders released a statement suggesting the emails shouldn't be an issue in the election.</p>", "<p>\"As I said at the first Democratic debate, there is a legal process in place which should proceed and not be politicized,\" he said. \"The voters of Iowa and this nation deserve a serious discussion of the issues facing them.\"</p>", "<p>Republicans, however, did not hesitate to politicize the issue.</p>", "<p>The emails have been an issue for Clinton's campaign since it became known 10 months ago that she exclusively used a nongovernment account linked to a homebrew server while in office. Clinton first called the decision a matter of convenience and then termed it a mistake, even if doing so wasn't expressly forbidden. But the matter could prove more troublesome now that Clinton's former agency has confirmed that business conducted over the account included top-secret matters.</p>", "<p>Like Clinton, the State Department discounted such a possibility last March. Both also said her account was never hacked or compromised, which security experts assess as unlikely, and that the vast majority of her emails were preserved properly for archiving purposes because she corresponded mainly with government accounts. They've backtracked from the archiving claim, while the AP discovered several phishing attempts on her server connected to Russia.</p>", "<p>The question of special access programs first surfaced last week, when Charles I. McCullough, the inspector general for U.S. intelligence agencies, <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/hillary-clinton-had-emails-on-server-more-classified-than-top-secret/\">cited examples on Clinton's account</a> in a letter to Congress. Republicans pounced on the report, though Clinton's campaign insisted none of the exchanges were \"classified at the time\" and accused McCullough and GOP lawmakers of selectively leaking materials to damage her presidential hopes.</p>", "<p>Kirby confirmed that the \"denied-in-full emails\" are among those McCullough recently cited. One of the emails, he said, was among those McCullough identified last summer as possibly containing top secret information.</p>", "<p>The AP reported last August that one focused on a forwarded news article about the classified U.S. drone program run by the CIA. Such operations are widely covered and discussed in the public sphere, including by top U.S. officials, and the State Department immediately pushed back against McCullough's claim. The other concerned North Korean nuclear weapons programs, according to officials.</p>", "<p>At the time, several officials from different agencies suggested the disagreement over the drone emails reflected the government's tendency to over-classify material, and the lack of consistent policies across difference agencies about what should and shouldn't be classified.</p>", "<p>The FBI also is looking into Clinton's email setup, but has said nothing about the nature of its probe. Independent experts say it is highly unlikely that Clinton will be charged with wrongdoing, based on the limited details that have surfaced up to now and the lack of indications that she intended to break any laws.</p>", "<p>\"What I would hope comes out of all of this is a bit of humility\" and an acknowledgement from Clinton that \"I made some serious mistakes,\" said Bradley Moss, a Washington lawyer who regularly handles security clearance matters.</p>", "<p>Legal questions aside, it's the potential political costs that are probably of more immediate concern for Clinton. She has struggled in surveys measuring her perceived trustworthiness and an active federal investigation, especially one buoyed by evidence that top secret material coursed through her account, could negate one of her main selling points for becoming commander in chief: Her national security resume.</p>"], "article_author": ["January 29, 2016, 3:12 PM"]}

Didn't devote tremendous time to [Iowa], didn't devote tremendous money to it.\"</p>", "<p>This might be a little bit of revisionist history. There was no state in which Trump invested more. He had one of the largest field staffs of any presidential candidate in Iowa, which continued to expand as the caucuses approached. He made more visits to Iowa than any other state. Iowa was the only state where Trump would hold three events in one day - something he did numerous times.</p>", "<p>Later, a reflective Trump confirmed what many had been speculating for months - that his ground game in Iowa wasn't very strong and contributed to his loss.</p>", "<p>\"We didn't have much of a ground game because I didn't think I was going to be winning,\" Trump told Fox News, before going on to say he was honored to finish second.</p>", "<p>Earlier on Tuesday, Trump touted the vote difference between him and the third place finisher, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, on caucus night, then attempted a reset of sorts, saying he expects things to be different in New Hampshire next week.</p>", "<p>\"I think it fits me better,\" Trump said. \"I've done very well in New Hampshire. I've been here a lot more, I have very good relationships with the people of New Hampshire. But I have had very good relationships with pretty much everybody.\"</p>", "<p>Trump's poll numbers in the state seem to bear that out. A CNN/WMUR poll released last week shows him in first place at 30%. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich are in second and third place - but both of their numbers combined don't equal Trump's. </p>", "<p>But in Milford, Trump tried to tamp down expectations a bit.</p>", "<p>\"It wouldn't be the worst thing in the world,\" Trump said about losing the New Hampshire primary. \"But I'd like to finish first.\"</p>", "<p>The Milford rally did feature some of the bombast his supporters have grown accustomed to on the trail. He started by spreading his arms wide and flexing his muscles. He mocked reporters for giving Rubio so much positive press for finishing third while simultaneously saying it was disappointing for Trump to finish second. </p>", "<p>\"The headline is 'Winner Of The Night, Marco Rubio!\"' Trump bellowed in front of thousands of supporters. \"'Trump Humiliated!\"'</p>", "<p>He took credit for the record turnout on the Republican side in Iowa - well, sort of.</p>", "<p>\"I'm not going to say that was me, but believe me, it was me!\"</p>", "<p>According to CBS News entrance polling, Trump pulled 31% of first time caucus goers, first in that category by far.</p>", "<p>\"It's Iowa, so it's not that big,\" said 17-year-old Noah Shields, a senior in high school who intends to vote for Trump. \"I mean, it's the first caucus - it's not major and he has a lot more to gain than Iowa. ... Here in New Hampshire, he has it.\"</p>", "<p>As always, his speech featured bits usually unique to Trump rallies. Roaming the floor at the Hampshire Hills Athletic Club where the speech took place was a man dressed like Trump - a site sporadically seen throughout the campaign. A woman wearing sunglasses with Trump's name plastered across the front cheered wildly while wearing a black fedora adorned with green Christmas lights. Another man wore a hat that said \"QUEENS N.Y.

He was convicted in the 1979 shooting death of suburban Atlanta store manager Roger Tackett.</p>", "<p>Jones declined to make a final statement in front of witnesses but agreed to have a prayer read.</p>", "<p>Georgia doesn't announce exactly when lethal injections begin, and the injection isn't visible to observers. But the warden left the execution chamber at 12:30 a.m., and records from past executions show the lethal drug generally begins to flow within a minute or two of the warden's departure.</p>", "<p>Jones was initially still with his eyes closed and then swallowed a couple of times and moved his head slightly. He opened his eyes at 12:36 a.m. and turned his head to his left, appearing to look toward a clock hanging on the wall. Then he closed his eyes again and took a few deep breaths before falling still.</p>", "<p>The execution had initially been set for 7 p.m. and was delayed while the U.S. Supreme Court considered appeals from Jones' attorneys. They asked the justices to block the execution for either of two reasons: because Jones was challenging Georgia's lethal injection secrecy law or because he said his death sentence was disproportionate to his crime.</p>", "<p>Around 11 p.m. Tuesday, the court denied the requests for a stay.</p>", "<p>The challenge to Georgia's strict execution secrecy law sharply divided the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Tuesday. The law classifies the identifying information of any person or entity who participates in an execution as a \"confidential state secret.\"</p>", "<p>Jones' lawyers argued the state's execution method carries \"a substantial risk of significant harm,\" violating his constitutional right against cruel and unusual punishment. But because of the secrecy law, they argued, they don't have enough information to make that claim, which violates his constitutional right to due process.</p>", "<p>Three-judge panels of the 11th Circuit had already rejected similar arguments, setting a binding precedent. But because of divided opinions expressed by judges on those panels, Jones' lawyers asked the full 11-judge court to consider their arguments. The court on Tuesday voted 6-5 to deny that review, but several judges offered strongly worded dissenting opinions.</p>", "<p>\"Today Brandon Jones will be executed, possibly in violation of the Constitution. He may also be cruelly and unusually punished in the process. But if he is, we will not know until it's too late - if ever,\" wrote Circuit Judge Robin S. Rosenbaum, adding that she believes the secrecy law denies Georgia death row inmates of their due process rights and may deprive them of their right to access to the courts.</p>", "<p>According to evidence at his trial, Jones and another man, Van Roosevelt Solomon, were arrested at a Cobb County store by a policeman who had driven a stranded motorist there to use a pay phone about 1:45 a.m. on June 17, 1979. The officer knew the store usually closed at midnight and was suspicious when he saw a car out front with the driver's door open and lights still on in the store.</p>", "<p>The officer saw Jones inside the store, prosecutors have said. He entered and drew his weapon after hearing four shots. He found Jones and Solomon just inside a storeroom door and took them into custody. Tackett's body was found inside the storeroom.</p>", "<p>Tests showed each man had recently fired a gun or handled a recently fired gun, prosecutors said. The cash drawer had been removed and was found wrapped in a plastic bag.</p>", "<p>Jones was convicted in October 1979 and sentenced to death. A federal judge in 1989 ordered a new sentencing hearing because jurors had improperly been allowed to bring a Bible into the deliberation room. He was resentenced to death in 1997.</p>", "<p>Solomon, who was also convicted and sentenced to death, was executed in Georgia's electric chair in February 1985.</p>"], "article_author": ["February 3, 2016, 2:22 AM"]}

Thirty-six percent of Republican primary voters support Trump, 17 points ahead of his closest rival, Texas Senator Ted Cruz (19 percent). Florida Senator Marco Rubio has now climbed to third place at 12 percent. Ben Carson -- who briefly surged to the top of the field at the end of October -- is tied with former Florida Governor Jeb Bush at 6 percent.</p>", "<p>Trump voters are firmer in their support for their candidate than are Republican primary voters who are voting for someone else. While 52 percent of Trump voters say their mind is made up, this is true of just 24 percent of Republican primary voters who support another candidate.</p>", "<p>Trump is the second choice of many Republican primary voters who don't support him. Eighteen percent of Republican primary voters who are not supporting Trump pick him as their top second choice, and 17 percent choose Marco Rubio. Trump voters overwhelmingly choose Ted Cruz (31 percent) as their top second choice candidate.</p>", "<p><strong>Enthusiasm for the Eventual Nominee</strong></p>", "<p>Enthusiasm for both Donald Trump and Ted Cruz has grown considerably since December. Now 40 percent of Republican primary voters say they would enthusiastically support Trump if he became the Republican nominee, up from 29 percent in December. Similarly, 37 percent say they would enthusiastically support Ted Cruz, up from 26 percent at the end of last year. Enthusiasm for Marco Rubio (32 percent) remains virtually unchanged.</p>", "<p>Most Republican primary voters expect Trump to be the party's nominee. Fifty-three percent think he'll win the nomination, far ahead of any other candidate.</p>", "<p><strong>Candidate Qualities</strong></p>", "<p>More than six in 10 Republican primary voters have at least some confidence that each of the three leading candidates in the Republican race - Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, and Marco Rubio - will be an effective commander-in- chief of the nation's military. Trump has a slight edge over Cruz: 34 percent of Republican primary voters are very confident in Trump, while 30 percent are very confident in Cruz. Republican primary voters show less confidence in Marco Rubio: just 20 percent are very confident that he will be an effective commander- in-chief.</p>", "<p>While majorities of Republican primary voters think both Cruz (68 percent) and Rubio (64 percent) have the right temperament to be President, they are more divided over Trump (50 percent).</p>", "<p>Although about six in10 Republican primary voters think all three candidates share their values, slightly more think so of Cruz (63 percent) than either Trump (59 percent) or Rubio (59 percent).</p>", "<p>The poll reflects dissatisfaction among Republican primary voters. Over seven in 10 Republican primary voters think America's culture and values are changing in a direction that they disagree with, far more than Democratic primary voters (40 percent) or Americans overall (54 percent). Trump voters (78 percent) are more likely to disagree with the change in the country's values and culture than Republican primary voters who support other candidates (71 percent).</p>", "<p><strong>Issues: The 2010 Affordable Care Act</strong></p>", "<p>Republican primary voters continue to strongly oppose the 2010 Affordable Care Act in far greater measure than Americans overall. Eighty-eight percent of Republican primary voters disapprove of the law, and about 73 percent say they disapprove strongly.</p>", "<p>Repealing the 2010 Affordable Care Act is popular with Republican primary voters, and it has been advocated by all of the candidates running for the Republican nomination. While 53 percent of Americans think just minor changes are needed to make the current law work better, 65 percent of Republican primary voters think the law has so much wrong with it that it needs to be repealed entirely.</p>", "<p><strong>Issues: Illegal Immigration</strong></p>", "<p>While Republican primary voters overall are divided over whether to allow undocumented immigrants already living in the U.S. to stay in some fashion, 59 percent of Trump supporters think all undocumented immigrants in the U.S. should be required to leave the country.</p>", "<p>Most Americans overall think immigrants here illegally should be allowed to stay in the country and apply for citizenship.</p>", "<p>And while building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border finds favor with Republican primary voters in general (75 percent), it is particularly popular among Trump voters (91 percent). Americans overall are divided on this issue.</p>", "<p><strong>The 2016 Presidential Campaign: Attention, Enthusiasm, and Interest</strong></p>", "<p>Republican primary voters are paying more attention to the 2016 race for President than their Democratic counterparts.

Ted Cruz, R-Texas, may have taken a step too far against his Republican colleagues in the Senate over the weekend. He was slapped down by Republican leaders - verbally and legislatively - in a rare Sunday Senate session.</p>", "<p>\"The Senate floor has too often become a forum for partisan messaging\" conservative Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, lamented during Cruz's antics. Hatch kept going, calling the Senate floor a \"misused as a tool to advance personal ambitions, a venue to promote political campaigns, and even a vehicle to enhance fund-raising efforts, all at the expense of proper functioning of this body.\"</p>", "<p>The conflict came during debate over highway transportation funding, which is due to run out this week. Cruz wouldn't let up his opposition to an amendment to the highway bill, which would resurrect the Export-Import Bank. The bank's charter expired June 30, when Congress let it lapse. While the bank -- which provides loans to other countries to help them buy American goods and services -- is favored by Democrats and some Republicans, conservatives like Cruz deride it as corporate welfare.</p>", "<p>The fight began Friday morning when Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, stood on the Senate floor and took the unusual step of calling Majority Leader Mitch McConnell a liar, saying he couldn't be trusted.</p>", "<p>\"It saddens me to say this. I sat in my office, I told my staff the majority leader looked me in the eye and looked 54 Republicans in the eye. I cannot believe he would tell a flat-out lie, and I voted based on those assurances that he made to each and every one of us,\" Cruz said.</p>", "<p>\"What we just saw today was an absolute demonstration that not only what he told every Republican senator, but what he told the press over and over and over again, was a simple lie,\" Cruz said.</p>", "<p>McConnell's \"lie,\" said Cruz, was the promise that there was no \"special deal\" to resurrect the bank. In fact, the Senate did hold a vote on the bank Sunday, and a strong bipartisan contingent of 67 senators passed the amendment reauthorizing the bank.</p>", "<p>But McConnell dismissed the idea that any sort of \"special deal\" was behind bringing the amendment to the floor. \"When there is overwhelming bipartisan support for an idea, even if I oppose it, it doesn't require some 'special deal' to see a vote occur on that measure,\" he said.</p>", "<p>Other Republican leaders, like Cruz's fellow Texan, Sen. John Cornyn, Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tennessee, and Hatch were incensed by Cruz's accusations, and they rose to defend McConnell on the floor.</p>", "<p>\"There was no misrepresentation made by the majority leader on the Ex-Im Bank,\" Cornyn said.</p>", "<p>Hatch attacked Cruz - without naming him - for what he deemed to be a flagrant violation of Senate rules and decorum. </p>", "<p>\"The Senate floor has even become a place where Senators have singled out colleagues by name to attack them in personal terms and to impugn their character--in blatant disregard of Senate rules, which plainly prohibit such conduct,\" Hatch said Sunday.</p>", "<p>Cruz would not apologize, though, and said he had not violated the rules.</p>", "<p>\"I would note that it is entirely consistent with decorum and with the nature of this body traditionally as the world's greatest deliberative body, to speak the truth,\" Cruz said. No one in the Senate spoke out to defend Cruz.</p>", "<p>And the Senate wasn't done with Cruz yet. The Texas senator was trying to hold a vote on an amendment to prevent the Senate from lifting sanctions against <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/iran-nuclear-deal-lobbying-being-called-mother-congressional-fights/\">Iran</a>, until Iran met certain conditions (recognizing Israel's right to exist and freeing four captive Americans).</p>", "<p>In a startling legislative rebuke, the Senate refused to allow Cruz the roll-call vote on his amendment. He needed 10 other senators to raise their hands to allow the vote, and he was only able to muster three.</p>", "<p>Later, an amendment from one of Cruz's few friends in the Senate, Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, to cut off federal funds to Planned Parenthood, met a similar fate.</p>", "<p>The only other amendment McConnell allowed to be considered on the highway bill was an amendment to repeal the <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/obamacare/\">Affordable Care Act</a>. That failed 49 to 43, mostly along party lines, with eight senators not voting.</p>", "<p>The Senate is expected to vote on final passage of the highway bill and the reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank this week.</p>"], "article_author": ["Rebecca Kaplan"]}

The Republican field is getting so crowded that he's entering the race on the <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/five-things-to-know-about-carly-fiorina/\">same day as former businesswoman Carly Fiorina</a>, and will join a group of declared candidates that includes Republican Sens. <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/ted-cruz-appeals-to-christian-conservatives-in-2016-kickoff/\">Ted Cruz of Texas</a>, <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/rand-paul-announces-hes-running-for-president/\">Rand Paul of Kentucky</a> and <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/marco-rubio-set-to-kick-off-2016-campaign-with-generational-message/\">Marco Rubio of Florida</a>.</p>", "<p>What he lacks in political experience he makes up for with a powerful personal story appealing to the Republican base, and a willingness to take shots at President Obama that are, even he will admit, are not politically correct.</p>", "<p>Plus, he doesn't think his lack of political experience is a problem.</p>", "<p>\"The real pedigree we need to help heal this country is someone who believes in our Constitution and is willing to put it on the top shelf,\" he said at his announcement event in Detroit Monday.</p>", "<p>Here are five things to know about Ben Carson:</p>", "<p><strong>1.  He is a renowned neurosurgeon:</strong> Though he was initially interested in psychiatry, Carson realized in medical school that he had the interests and abilities that aligned with the skills he would need as a neurosurgeon. After medical school at the University of Michigan, he went to Johns Hopkins Hospital to do his residency and at 33 became the director of pediatric neurosurgery, the youngest physician to ever run a major division at the hospital. He was also the first African-American to hold such a position.</p>", "<p> What first thrust Carson into the spotlight was his role as the primary surgeon on the first team to successfully separate a pair of conjoined twins who were connected at the head in 1997. Other attempts at such an operation had almost always killed one or both twins.</p>", "<p>It was that accomplishment in part that led former President George W. Bush to award him with the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2008. In a press release announcing the honor, Johns Hopkins Children's Center noted that Carson was told \"while performing a delicate seven-hour surgery.\"</p>", "<p><strong>2.  He's also a successful author and philanthropist:</strong> Carson has authored a total of six books and a handful of them have done relatively well. His 1996 memoir, <em>Gifted Hands</em>, was made into a 2009 TV movie starring Cuba Gooding, Jr. </p>", "<p>In August, another Carson book,<em> One Nation</em> - which outlines his political philosophy - outsold <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/hillary-clintons-hard-choices-bergdahl-benghazi-and-more/\"><em>Hard Choices</em>,</a> the memoir authored by Hillary Clinton, last August when it sold 224,990 copies to Clinton's 222,822. It made the New York Times bestseller list.</p>", "<p>Carson and his wife, Candy, have also been active philanthropists. In 1994, they established the Carson Scholars Fund to provide college scholarships to students who show academic excellence and perform community service. The organization has awarded more than 6,700 scholarships since 1996, the first year the scholarship was offered, and give out more than 500 awards each year.</p>", "<p>Carson has often spoken about the importance of education and how it affected his own journey from a poor Detroit neighborhood.</p>", "<p><strong>3.  He grew up poor in Detroit, the son of a single mother: </strong>The anchor of Carson's biography is that he was raised by a single mother with a third-grade education . But she placed a high premium on education and demanded that her two sons read two books each week from the Detroit Public Library and submit written reports on them instead of watching TV - even though she couldn't always understand what they wrote.</p>", "<p>\"The most important thing she did for myself and my brother: not accept excuses. And I think that led to both of our success,\" Carson said at a dinner for an Iowa Christian organization last fall.</p>", "<p>He has been open about the fact that he was not always a model student, and struggled with anger issues as a child. As a teenager, he <a href=\"http://www.gq.com/news-politics/newsmakers/201504/ben-carson-tea-party?currentPage=2\">tried to stab a friend</a> during an argument over which radio station to listen to, but the knife hit hid friend's belt buckle and snapped instead.</p>", "<p>He writes in <em>Gifted Hands</em> about how he prayed after the incident and it changed his life.  After that, he went on to Yale University and University of Michigan for medical school.</p>", "<p>His path made him a role model within the black community and <em>Gifted Hands</em> became recommended reading for young men.</p>", "<p>\"I can't even count how many times I saw Ben Carson when I was a kid,\" writer Ta-Nehisi Coates, who grew up in inner-city Baltimore in the 1980s and 1990s, said in a recent <a href=\"http://www.gq.com/news-politics/newsmakers/201504/ben-carson-tea-party?currentPage=2\">Carson profile in GQ magazine</a>. \"Any time anyone wanted to bring out any sort of inspirational figure for young black kids, especially young black boys, in Baltimore, you turned to Ben Carson.\" </p>", "<p><strong>4.  He skyrocketed to fame by condemning Obamacare at the National Prayer Breakfast:</strong>  Carson spoke at the 1997 National Prayer Breakfast without incident but it was his remarks at that same breakfast in 2013 that propelled him to conservative stardom when he laid into the president who was sitting just a few feet away. He was harshly critical of both the <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/obamacare/\">Affordable Care Act</a> and the president's fiscal policies.</p>", "<p>The speech was so popular it prompted the conservative Wall Street Journal editorial page to write a piece entitled, <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323452204578292302358207828\">\"Ben Carson for President.\"</a></p>", "<p>It turned out to be the launching point for plenty of criticism of the law. Later that year, Carson called it <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/videos/ben-carson-obamacare-worst-thing-since-slavery/\">\"the worst thing\" in America since slavery</a>.</p>", "<p>\"Obamacare is really, I think the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery,\" he said. \"And it is in a way, it is slavery in a way because it is making all of us subservient to the government. And it was never about healthcare, it was about control.\"</p>", "<p><strong>5.  He's a popular figure among conservative activists:</strong> His up-close-and-personal criticism of the president won Carson plaudits among the GOP base and he has been a consistent and popular speaker on the circuit of Republican confabs and cattle calls. He was popular enough that a \"National Draft Ben Carson for President\" political action committee brought in $13.5 million dollars (by comparison, the \"Ready for Hillary\" PAC netted $12.9 million). </p>", "<p>Interestingly, he isn't a lifelong Republican. Carson has described himself as a \"rabid\" Democrat when he started at Yale because of what he had always heard about Republicans as a child in Detroit. He began to change his views when he started listening to Ronald Reagan - but it wasn't necessarily enough to keep him loyal to the Republican Party (he claims to have been turned off by unfaithful Republicans impeaching former President Bill Clinton for the Monica Lewinsky affair in the 1990s). At the time of the National Prayer Breakfast speech in 2013, he was actually registered as an independent.</p>", "<p> \"I happen to be an independent -- registered as an independent -- but anything I talk about or advocate, I would challenge anybody to show me where it's not logical,\" he <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/neurosurgeon-reacts-to-republican-praise-after-speech-goes-viral/\">told WJZ, CBS News' Baltimore affiliate, after the speech</a>. \"If Democrats happen to agree with what I'm talking about, great. If Republicans happen to be the ones who agree with what I'm talking about, great.\"</p>", "<p>He clearly found a home in the GOP, however, switched his registration to Republican late last year.</p>", "<p>He's no second-tier contender among the GOP hopefuls: A recent CBS News poll found that 34 percent of Republicans said they would consider voting for Carson for the nomination, tying him for fourth place with former Texas Gov. Rick Perry (those who would be more widely considered include former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and Rubio). Just 10 percent of Republicans said they wouldn't consider voting for him, and more than half - 56 percent - said they still didn't know enough about him. </p>", "<p>That puts him in better standing than more prominent fellow Republicans including Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (30 percent would consider voting for him), Paul (30 percent) and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum (28 percent). </p>"], "article_author": ["Rebecca Kaplan"]}

Voters can expect to hear Bush talk about his ability to fix America's problems because he has the experience to do it (having served as Florida governor); that he is the kind of leader who with the \"heart to help people rise up;\" and that his candidacy will be  \"speaking to everyone without flinching.\"</p>", "<p>Another <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vet1HHyYtZQ\">video</a> that will play at the launch touts specific issues Bush worked on as Florida governor.</p>", "<p>\"We grew our economy, and led the nation in job growth. Defended life and protected women from domestic violence. Eliminated waste and balanced budgets. Reformed schools and gave every child an opportunity. We led, we reformed, we got results,\" Bush says in the video. \"That's what's missing from Washington. The D.C. crowd talks about what's wrong with America. I see what's right. They talk about problems. I see solutions...I see a great country on the verge of its greatest century, and I'm ready to lead.\"</p>", "<p>His presumed entry to the race and fundraising prowess did not have the effect of clearing the rest of the GOP field: Ten other candidates have <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/who-is-running-for-president-in-2016/\">already entered the race</a> and another four more could jump in after Bush does. And while Bush has locked down the support of many of the GOP's big donors and staff members, he has plenty of competition in the early polls from politicians like Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio.</p>", "<p>Here are five things to know about Jeb Bush:</p>", "<p><strong>He is the early frontrunner among the GOP establishment: </strong>With a father and a brother who served in the White House, Bush has immediate name recognition and a fundraising network unmatched by any of the other Republican candidates.</p>", "<p>At first, it seemed like that would make Bush a daunting figure in the race. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP nominee, <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/mitt-romney-announces-he-wont-run-for-president/\">ended an early flirtation with a third presidential bid</a> that would have put him in competition for donors with Bush. And Right to Rise, Bush's super PAC, was apparently so flush with donations earlier this year that officials had to cap contributions at $1 million per person. An official with Right to Rise told CBS News that Bush told a group of about 350 donors to the super PAC in April that they had <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-much-money-do-you-need-to-run-for-president/\">raised more money in the first 100 days of existence</a> than other GOP operation in recent memory.</p>", "<p>With Romney out, Bush seemed like the most viable option for big Republican donors and party elders. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who was sought after as a presidential candidate in 2012, is still mulling whether the damage from the Bridgegate scandal is fatal to his candidacy. And some candidates, like Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, neurosurgeon Ben Carson and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee aren't expected to reach as broad a swath of voters as Bush.</p>", "<p>But there are signs that his front-runner status may be slipping. Even though Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, got some of his political education from Bush, the younger Floridian <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/five-things-to-know-about-marco-rubio/\">decided not to put his own presidential ambitions on hold</a> and is doing well in the polls. Walker, the Wisconsin governor, has proven popular on the early-state speaking circuit and his poll numbers have also been strong. Although his fundraising has been prodigious, recent reports say the Right to Rise super PAC <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/report-jeb-bush-super-pac-unlikely-to-raise-100-million-by-end-of-june/\">may not reach its goal of raising more than $100 million</a> by the end of June.  </p>", "<p>Forty-six percent of Republican voters <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/poll-the-2016-presidential-race/\">told CBS News in a survey last month that they'd consider supporting Bush for the party's 2016 presidential nomination</a>. Twenty-three percent said they would not consider it. Those numbers are slightly down from a <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/republicans-want-mitt-romney-jeb-bush-to-run-for-president-in-2016/\">January poll</a> that found 50 percent of Republicans wanted like to see former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush on the campaign trail. On the other hand, 27 percent of voters in that poll said they wouldn't consider voting for Bush, versus 23 percent in the more recent poll.</p>", "<p>While in many big ways Bush's family history is an asset, it has its drawbacks. Bush spent several days in May stumbling on questions about whether he would have gone through with the 2003 invasion of Iraq given what is known today (about the presence of weapons of mass destruction). After initially answering yes, he ultimately switched his position to say he <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/election-2016-jeb-bush-i-would-not-have-gone-into-iraq/\">would not have gone into the country</a>.</p>", "<p><strong>He was once considered a model conservative....</strong> Bush's own political career began in the early 1980s, when he was elected to the Miami Dade County Republican Party. He later served as Florida's secretary of commerce in 1987. Bush made his first bid for the governor's mansion in 1994, calling himself a \"head-banging conservative,\" but narrowly lost to the sitting Democratic governor, Lawton Chiles. In 1998, Bush ran again and was elected.</p>", "<p>During his two terms as governor he was credited with overhauling the state's education system and sharply reducing the state's tax burden. He signed legislation partnering the state with the federal government to restore the Everglades, and he also pushed through an overhaul of the state's medical liability laws. His reelection in 2002 made him the first Republican to win a second term as governor in the history of Florida.</p>", "<p>\"Jeb was a very popular governor, he was a very successful governor,\" said Florida-based strategist Rick Wilson <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/jeb-bush-sets-the-pace-for-potential-competitors-in-2016/\">told CBS News during an interview in January</a>. \"He really, at the time, set a national model for how a conservative legislative path could be carved in a state...that had been controlled largely by Democrats for decades.\"</p>", "<p><strong>...but now some of the GOP base takes issue with his positions on immigration and education: </strong>Last year, Bush said that the eventual <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/a-blast-from-the-past-can-jeb-bush-survive-his-own-party/\">Republican nominee</a> must be prepared \"to lose the primary to win the general, without violating your principles.\"</p>", "<p>\"We don't have to make a point any more as Republicans,\" he said. \"We have to actually show that we can, in an adult-like way, we can govern, lead.\"</p>", "<p>For Bush, that will mean effectively defending his more moderate positions on immigration and his support for the <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-debate-over-common-core/\">Common Core School Standards</a>.</p>", "<p>Bush has spent his years since leaving the Florida governor's mansion working on education reform issues and has become a <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/jeb-bush-defends-common-core-standards/\">champion for the Common Core school standards</a>. Many other Republican politicians, including Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, initially embraced the standards before running in the opposite direction once it became clear that many in the conservative base view the standards as a federal overreach and threat to parental rights. Even Christie, one of the last potential candidates on the GOP side to buck the base and support the standards, <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/chris-christie-backs-away-from-common-core/\">walked away last month</a>. Bush is now the only top-tier  candidate supporting Common Core.</p>", "<p>\"Voters are very closely viewing it as a litmus test,\" Tamara Scott, a policy adviser and lobbyist with the FAMiLY LEADER, an Iowa-based social conservatives' group, told CBS News in February. \"[W]hen you take parents out of the picture, which is what Common Core will do, most people find that offensive.\"</p>", "<p>Bush remains undeterred. \"In my view, the rigor of the Common Core State Standards must be the new minimum in classrooms. For those states choosing a path other than Common Core, I say this: Aim even higher, be bolder, raise standards and ask more of our students and the system,\" he <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/jeb-bush-defends-common-core-standards/\">said during a speech last November</a>. </p>", "<p>Bush has been equally defiant on the immigration issue, where he is one of the few GOP contenders willing to back a path to legal status for those in the U.S. illegally. He has <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/jeb-bush-and-the-perils-of-immigration/\">become far more moderate</a> since his failed 1994 gubernatorial campaign when he said the government should start deporting people who were in the U.S. illegally.</p>", "<p>At the Conservative Political Action Conference earlier this year, Bush - who drew boos when Fox News' Sean Hannity brought up his immigration status - said, \"There is no plan to deport 11 million people.\"</p>", "<p>\"We should give them a path for legal status where they work, they don't get government benefits, where they learn English,\" he said.</p>", "<p><strong>He has maximized his fundraising abilities by waiting a long time to declare his candidacy: </strong>Part of Bush's late entry into the presidential race was almost certainly a strategic decision to maximize his ability to raise money. Because he has not been an official candidate until now, he was allowed to coordinate with his super PAC - and ask donors for more than the limit of $2,700 per donor per election he would have to respect as a candidate.</p>", "<p>\"What he's trying to do is maximize his money and maximize the amount of money he can take in from individual contributors,\" Lawrence Noble, senior counsel at the Campaign Legal Center and a former FEC general counsel, told CBS News earlier this year. It was a strategy that no other candidate had attempted, and Noble predicted that unless the Federal Election Committee (FEC) objected, other candidates would eventually try the same thing.</p>", "<p>The FEC did not object. But watchdog groups have: Bush - along with fellow Republicans Walker and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum Walker, as well as former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, a Democrat - was the subject of complaints filed by the Campaign Legal Center and Democracy 21.</p>", "<p>\"These 2016 presidential contenders must take the American people for fools--flying repeatedly to Iowa and New Hampshire to meet with party leaders and voters, hiring campaign staff, and raising millions of dollars from deep-pocketed mega donors, all the while denying that they are even 'testing the waters' of a presidential campaign,\" said Paul S. Ryan, Campaign Legal Center Senior Counsel. \"But...the candidate contribution limits kick in as soon as a person begins raising and spending money to determine whether they're going to run for office.\"</p>", "<p>Bush <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/jeb-bush-promises-no-coordination-with-super-pac-if-he-runs/\">said on \"Face the Nation\" last month</a> that he would \"never\" violate campaign finance laws and promised \"no coordination at all\" with the super PAC if he runs. So far, the FEC seems to agree.</p>", "<p><strong>He has deep ties to the Latino community: </strong>There are two Republican candidates born of Cuban heritage - Rubio and Cruz - but Bush's claim to the hearts and minds of Latino voters is arguably just as strong. Bush, unlike Cruz, is a fluent Spanish speaker and was called Florida's \"first Cuban-American governor\" by former Sen. Mel Martinez for his work on Miami's powerful Cuban community.</p>", "<p>Bush's strong ties to the Latino community were established long before he ever set foot in the governor's office. He met his wife, Columba Garnica de Gallo, in 1971 when he traveled to Le\u00f3n, Mexico as a high school student. He majored in Latin American studies when he attended University of Texas (a school that put him geographically closer to Gallo before they married) and the two lived in Caracas, Venezuela for two years when Bush worked at the Texas Commerce Bank. It was his wife's family that brought Bush to Miami, which would become his adopted home. He often speaks Spanish both at home and in public. He even converted to Catholicism, his wife's religion.</p>", "<p>\"Jeb is Cuban. He's Nicaraguan. He's Venezuelan,\" Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, one of three Cuban-American Republicans from Miami in Congress, <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/elections-2016/jeb-bush/article23887813.html\">told the Miami Herald</a>. \"The stamp of South Florida is in his DNA.\"</p>", "<p>On one occasion, he may have taken his adopted identity too much to heart. The New York Times reported in April that Bush <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/why-did-jeb-bush-claim-to-be-hispanic-on-a-voter-form/\">identified himself as \"Hispanic\"</a> on a 2009 voter-registration application obtained from the Miami-Dade County Elections Department. </p>", "<p>He later joked about it on Twitter with his son, George P. Bush.</p>", "<p><em>CBS News' Steve Chaggaris and Jake Miller contributed to this report.</em></p>"], "article_author": ["Rebecca Kaplan"]}

I'm running for president,\" Clinton says. \"Americans have fought their way back from tough economic times. But the deck is still stacked in favor of those at the top. Everyday Americans need a champion, and I want to be that champion. So you can do more than just get by, you can get ahead and stay ahead. Because when families are strong, America is strong. So I'm hitting the road to earn your vote. Because it's your time, and I hope you'll join us on this journey.\"</p>", "<p>Clinton also tweeted the announcement, sharing her campaign website with followers and unveiling the campaign's new logo.</p>", "<p>The video was preempted minutes earlier by an e-mail message to donors and campaign alumni from campaign advisor John Podesta. He wrote, \"I wanted to make sure you heard it first from me - it's official: Hillary's running for president.\"</p>", "<p>The quiet launch of Clinton's campaign stood in stark contrast to the<a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/can-hillary-clinton-justify-her-frontrunner-status/\"> speculation about her plans</a> that had reached a fever pitch over the last several months. She won't hold her first major campaign rally until May, instead, she's embarking on a softer rollout that will emphasize smaller, intimate events in the early caucus state of Iowa designed to downplay her celebrity and allow her to interact one-on-one with voters.</p>", "<p>In a memo sent to members of Clinton's team Saturday, campaign manager Robby Mook outlined the values that are supposed to guide the campaign: \"To give every family, every small business, and every American a path to lasting prosperity by electing Hillary Clinton the next President of the United States. This campaign is not about Hillary Clinton and not about us--it's about the everyday Americans who are trying to build a better life for themselves and their families.\"</p>", "<p>Among the guiding principles he listed: \"We are humble\" \"We are a diverse, talented family\" and \"We are disciplined: driven every day by strategy, not tactics or one offs.\"</p>", "<p>Clinton will take her campaign on the road next week with a visit to an early voting state, likely Iowa. Though her team hasn't confirmed her destination, the choice of Iowa would be symbolically significant to Clinton - it was her loss to then-Illinois Sen. Barack Obama in that state's 2008 caucuses that dashed her aura of inevitability in that year's Democratic primary and began the road to her defeat. Making the Hawkeye State her first official campaign visit would signal that she intends to take nothing for granted this time.</p>", "<p>Clinton, 67, has been a fixture of American public life for decades. She was Arkansas' first lady when her husband Bill was governor, and she became first lady of the United States when Bill Clinton assumed the presidency in 1993. She ran for a Senate seat in New York in 2000, and spent nearly eight years as a member of the Senate before launching her first bid for the presidency in 2008. Though she was defeated in the primary that year by Mr. Obama, she joined his cabinet as secretary of state when the new administration took the reins in 2009.</p>", "<p>The Republican National Committee immediately sought to throw cold water on the announcement. In a statement, chairman Reince Priebus said, \"Americans need a president they can trust and voters do not trust Hillary Clinton. Over decades as a Washington insider, Clinton has left a trail of secrecy, scandal, and failed policies that can't be erased from voters' minds.\"</p>", "<p>Other declared and expected candidates for the Republican nomination were also swift to condemn her record, and a few even sought to <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/republicans-seek-cash-off-of-clinton-presidential-announcement/\">fundraise off her announcement</a>.</p>", "<p>On many domestic policy issues, Clinton has generally hewed closely to the current administration's policies. She's defended Obamacare from GOP attacks, embraced the administration's proposals to overhaul the tax code and reform the immigration system, and lauded Mr. Obama's proposals to expand pre-kindergarten education and reduce the cost of college.</p>", "<p>On foreign policy, she's seen as relatively hawkish, for a Democrat. She voted to authorize the 2003 invasion of Iraq, though she now says that was a mistake. As secretary of state, she pushed (successfully) for U.S. military action to oust Libyan dictator Moammar Ghadafi, and she pushed (unsuccessfully) for the administration to arm Syrian rebels fighting the regime of Bashar Assad. She was also credited with marshaling international support for sanctions on Iran, laying the groundwork for the current negotiations over that country's nuclear energy program.</p>", "<p><a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/will-hillary-clintons-stance-on-womens-rights-come-under-attack/\">Women's equality</a> has been a particular focus of Clinton's time in public life, from her famous declaration at a 1994 conference in Beijing that \"women's rights are human rights,\" to her creation of the Office of Global Women's Issues at the State Department. Though she did not particularly emphasize her gender or the historic nature of her candidacy in the 2008 race, she's signaled that she plans a more concerted effort to elevate women's issues - and woo female voters - in the 2016 campaign. If she wins, she would make history as the first female U.S. president.</p>", "<p>Since she left the administration in 2013, Clinton has written a memoir, <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/hillary-clintons-hard-choices-bergdahl-benghazi-and-more/\">\"Hard Choices,\"</a> embarked on a book tour, and hit the paid speakers' circuit. She became a grandmother last year when her daughter Chelsea gave birth to a daughter, Charlotte Clinton Mezvinsky. In an updated epilogue to \"Hard Choices,\" Clinton wrote about how Charlotte has refocused her political priorities, offering a hint about how being a grandmother could shape her 2016 campaign themes.</p>", "<p>\"You shouldn't have to be the granddaughter of a President or a Secretary of State to receive excellent health care, education, enrichment, and all the support and advantages that will one day lead to a good job and a successful life,\" she wrote. \"I'm more convinced than ever that our future in the 21st century depends on our ability to ensure that a child born in the hills of Appalachia or the Mississippi Delta or the Rio Grande Valley grows up with the same shot at success that Charlotte will.\"</p>", "<p>It hasn't been entirely smooth sailing for Clinton since she stepped down from the State Department. Her book tour was somewhat marred by a few awkward answers about her personal finances, and she's faced intense scrutiny in recent weeks about her <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/hillary-clinton-used-only-personal-email-account-at-state-department/\">use of a private email server as secretary of state</a>. She's said it was a decision made for the sake of convenience, and that she's already turned over any work-related emails to the state department. Critics have accused her of breaking federal archiving rules for the sake of maintaining absolute control over her privacy.</p>", "<p>Republicans have also questioned her <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/clinton-foundation-defends-foreign-fundraising/\">family foundation's receipt of money from foreign governments</a>, raising the possibility that the donations could pose a conflict of interest. Clinton has emphasized that the money has been spent on valuable philanthropic work, and she's said the foundation will not accept any foreign money during her campaign or (if she wins) her presidency.</p>", "<p>Clinton Foundation officials confirmed to CBS News Sunday that Clinton is stepping down from her post there.</p>", "<p>A foundation official told CBS News that the boards of the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Health Access Initiative will also consider changes in their donor policies this week. </p>", "<p>The official says changes include more frequent disclosure of donors. </p>", "<p>The official did not say whether that includes revisiting restrictions on foreign donations. Officials have previously said that would be something they'd consider when she announced her candidacy. </p>", "<p>Clinton is the first Democrat to formally announce a 2016 candidacy, and she's considered an overwhelming favorite for the party's nod - early polls show her ahead of her potential primary competitors by as much as 50 points nationwide. A <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/poll-who-would-americans-consider-voting-for-in-2016/\">CBS News poll last month</a> found 81 percent of Democrats would consider voting for her in the primary, while only 10 percent would not.</p>", "<p>Despite Clinton's commanding position, there's still room for a challenger: 66 percent of Democrats said they'd like to see her face a strong competitor in the primary. Other Democrats weighing a bid include <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/joe-biden-takes-his-time-in-deciding-on-a-2016-presidential-run/\">Vice President Biden</a>, former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, and former <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/could-jim-webb-pose-a-threat-to-hillary-clinton-in-2016/\">Virginia Sen. Jim Webb</a>. Vermont Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders has also said he might jump into the fray.</p>", "<p>Her announcement was <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/elizabeth-warren-fans-undeterred-by-clinton-announcement/\">not enough to quiet the groups championing a presidential bid by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts</a>. They promised to redouble their efforts to convince Warren to enter the race in order to give more of a voice to issues like income inequality and Wall Street accountability. Warren has <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/senator-elizabeth-warren-wont-be-running-for-president-says-system-is-rigged-against-middle-class/\">repeatedly said she is not running for president</a>.</p>", "<p>Though it's still early in the cycle, most polls show Clinton leading her prospective Republican challengers in the general election. A McClatchy-Marist survey last month, for example, found Clinton ahead of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio by seven points nationally, ahead of Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker by four points, and ahead of Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul by 11 points.</p>", "<p>Clinton's 2016 campaign architecture is starting to come into focus, and it's a subject of fairly intense interest, given the infighting and opaque command structure that plagued her last bid. Democratic strategist Robby Mook will manage the campaign, Podesta, a veteran Democratic operative, will assume a senior leadership role, possibly campaign chairman, and longtime Clinton aide Huma Abedin is expected to serve in a senior advisory role. Joel Benenson, who was Mr. Obama's pollster in 2008, has signed on to Clinton's 2016 bid as well. The campaign has leased space in a Brooklyn office building to serve as its headquarters.</p>", "<p>Apart from the formal campaign structure, Clinton's bid stands to benefit from a constellation of outside liberal groups that have been formed in recent years. A grassroots group encouraging her to jump into the race, <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/voters-ready-for-hillary-unfazed-by-clintons-email-drama/\">Ready for Hillary</a>, has already raised millions of dollars and is expected to spend millions more amplifying Clinton's campaign message. She's also inherited the support of Priorities USA, a super PAC that was formed to boost President Obama in 2012. And a group called Correct the Record will serve as an independent rapid-response outfit, fact-checking and rebutting conservative attacks against Clinton.</p>", "<p>It's likely she'll need all the help she can get. Few Democrats have absorbed as much criticism from Republicans as Hillary Clinton has absorbed over the years, and the attacks will only become more frequent and more heated as the 2016 campaign progresses. Already, the GOP's potential candidates are regularly assailing Clinton in their public appearances, and the Republican National Committee [RNC] is training its fire on Clinton as if she'd already won the Democratic nomination.</p>", "<p>In an online ad released Friday, the RNC attempted to sow doubts about Clinton's tenure as secretary of state and her use of a private email server. \"From the East Wing to the State Department, Hillary Clinton has left a trail of secrecy, scandal and failed liberal policies that no image consultant can erase,\" said RNC Chairman Reince Priebus in a press release. \"Voters want to elect someone they can trust and Hillary's record proves that she cannot be trusted. We must 'Stop Hillary.'\"</p>"], "article_author": ["Jake Miller, Rebecca Kaplan"]}

Here are some key findings from the CBS News Iowa entrance poll.</p>", "<p>In a very tight contest, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders drew support from very different groups of <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/elections/2016/primaries/democrat/iowa/\">Democratic caucus-goers</a> tonight. As many expected, Sanders drew strong support from young people and first-time caucus attenders, and in fact support among young people easily topped Barack Obama's success with them in 2008.</p>", "<p>Eighty-four percent of those under 30 supported Sanders, as did 60 percent of those between 30 and 44. And it was not just young men who turned out for Sanders. Eighty-six percent of women under 30 said they supported Sanders, and he won the support of women between the ages of 30 and 44 by 53 percent to 42 percent.</p>", "<p>Overall, Clinton did well among women caucus attenders with an 11-point margin over Sanders, as she drew strong support among women over 45 who were a majority of the women who came out to the Democratic caucuses. </p>", "<p>Sanders also seemed to accomplish what many doubted he could do - turn out new and young voters. Forty-four percent of Democratic caucus attenders in the CBS News entrance poll said this was their first caucus. And Sanders beat Clinton by 59 percent to 37 percent among this group.</p>", "<p>In 2008, Obama only won 41 percent of those who were attending their first caucus. All of this suggests that that Sanders supporters were enthusiastic and motivated enough to come out to the caucuses tonight. </p>", "<p>Clinton and Sanders supporters differed on ideology and on the qualities they wanted to see in the next president. Sanders supporters were much more likely to call themselves very liberal than were Clinton supporters. His support was more ideological than was Obama's eight years ago. Dissatisfaction with Obama's policies also motivated support for Sanders.</p>", "<p>The CBS News Entrance Poll asked caucus attenders whether the next president should generally continue Barack Obama's policies of change to more liberal policies. Thirty-three percent wanted to see more liberal policies and 76 percent of them supported Sanders. Clinton benefited from those who want to protect Obama's policy accomplishments as she won the support of 68 percent of this larger group. </p>", "<p>Perhaps more than anything, it was vast differences in the qualities that Democratic caucus-goers wanted in the next president that distinguished Clinton and Sanders supporters. Twenty-eight percent said they want someone who has the right experience. Twenty percent said winning in November was most important. Clinton won both of these groups handily, capturing 88 percent of the first and 77 percent of the second group. In contrast, 26 percent said that someone who cares about them was most important and 24 percent said that having a candidate that is honest and trustworthy was key. Sanders won 74 percent of the first and 83 percent of the second group.  </p>", "<p>As was the case in 2008 and 2012, the Iowa Republican caucus winner was the preferred candidate of evangelical Christians. In 2012, 56 percent of <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/elections/2016/primaries/republican/iowa/\">Iowa Republican caucus goers</a> were evangelical Christians, in 2016 this number jumped to 64 percent. Ted Cruz was supported by 33 percent of evangelical Christians followed by 21 percent for Marco Rubio and 21 percent for Donald Trump.  In 2012 they backed Rick Santorum (33 percent) over Romney (14 percent), Perry (14 percent) and Gingrich (14 percent). In 2008, 60 percent of caucus goers were evangelical Christians and 46 percent of those supported Huckabee and 19 percent supported Romney. </p>", "<p>Many observers predicted that Donald Trump would need a large <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-iowa-caucus-who-will-win/\">turnout</a> of new Republican caucus goers to win tonight. First time caucus attenders were a slightly larger fraction in the CBS News entrance poll compared to four years ago. And, while Trump got the largest share of this group (31 percent), substantial numbers also supported Cruz (22 percent) and Rubio (21 percent). So while evangelical Christians turned out in large numbers, it appears that Trump was not able to turn out enough of his supporters. </p>", "<p>There is also evidence in the entrance poll that Cruz had a more successful ground operation in Iowa. Thirty-six percent of Republican caucus goers said that someone had personally contacted them about coming out for their candidate. Cruz won 31 percent of these people compared to 23 percent for Trump and 20 percent for Rubio.</p>", "<p>Rubio appeared to pick up strength in the last week of the campaign. Among those who said they made up their minds in the last week, he had the support of 29 percent, compared with 27 percent for Cruz and 14 percent for Trump. Some of this movement toward Rubio may have been the belief that he is the most electable Republican candidate. Of the 21 percent of caucus goers who said that winning in November is the most important quality they looked for, 43 percent supported Rubio. </p>", "<p>Republicans were split on whether they wanted someone with political experience or someone from outside of politics. Trump won the support of almost half of those who wanted someone outside of politics but only 3 percent of those who wanted someone with political experience. Cruz and Rubio ran about equally well among those who wanted a candidate with political experience. Cruz did get the support of 19 percent of those who wanted someone outside of politics compared to only 7 percent for Rubio. Although both serve in the Senate, Cruz appeals more to voters who are looking for an outsider. </p>", "<p>Trump's support came from people who responded positively to his core campaign themes: that he tells it like it is and that he will be tough on immigration. However, those groups were not large enough to carry him to victory. Only 14 percent of the caucus goers said that telling it like it is was their most important quality in a candidate and 13 percent listed immigration as the most important issue facing the country. In Iowa tonight, values and religion appear to have beaten out directness and immigrants. </p>", "<p><em>Stanley Feldman is professor of Political Science at Stony Brook University. </em></p>", "<p><em>Melissa Herrmann is president of SSRS.</em></p>"], "article_author": ["Stanley Feldman, Melissa Herrmann"]}

Carter had been stricken with prostate cancer in Toronto, the New Jersey native's adopted home.</p>", "<p>Carter spent 19 years in prison for three murders at a tavern in Paterson, New Jersey, in 1966. He was convicted alongside Artis in 1967 and again in a new trial in 1976.</p>", "<p>Carter was freed in November 1985 when his convictions were set aside after years of appeals and public advocacy. His ordeal and the alleged racial motivations behind it were publicized in Bob Dylan's 1975 song \"Hurricane,\" several books and a 1999 film starring Denzel Washington, who received an Academy Award nomination for playing the boxer turned prisoner.</p>", "<p>\"Rubin's case stands apart from almost any other murder case in the last 40 or 50 years because it was so involved in racial prejudice,\" said Selwyn Raab, an author and investigative journalist who covered Carter extensively for the New York Times. \"Here's a person with a big reputation the police are out to get him, and he gets convicted not once but twice on racially prejudiced evidence.\"</p>", "<p>Carter's murder convictions abruptly ended the boxing career of a former petty criminal who became an undersized middleweight contender largely on ferocity and punching power.</p>", "<p>Although never a world champion, Carter went 27-12-1 with 19 knockouts, memorably stopping two-division champ Emile Griffith in the first round in 1963. He also fought for a middleweight title in December 1964, losing a unanimous decision to Joey Giardello.</p>", "<p>In June 1966, three white people were shot by two black men at the Lafayette Bar and Grill in Paterson. Carter and Artis were convicted by an all-white jury largely on the testimony of two thieves who later recanted their stories.</p>", "<p>Carter was granted a new trial and briefly freed in 1976, but sent back for nine more years after being convicted in a second trial.</p>", "<p>\"I wouldn't give up,\" Carter said in an interview on PBS in 2011. \"No matter that they sentenced me to three life terms in prison. I wouldn't give up. Just because a jury of 12 misinformed people ... found me guilty did not make me guilty. And because I was not guilty, I refused to act like a guilty person.\"</p>", "<p>Dylan became aware of Carter's plight after reading the boxer's autobiography. He met Carter and co-wrote \"Hurricane,\" which he performed on his Rolling Thunder Revue tour in 1975.</p>", "<p>Muhammad Ali also spoke out on Carter's behalf, while advertising art director George Lois and other celebrities also worked toward Carter's release.</p>", "<p>With a network of friends and volunteers also advocating for him, Carter eventually won his release from U.S. District Judge H. Lee Sarokin, who wrote that Carter's prosecution had been \"predicated upon an appeal to racism rather than reason, and concealment rather than disclosure.\"</p>", "<p>Born on May 6, 1937, into a family of seven children, Carter struggled with a hereditary speech impediment and was sent to a juvenile reform center at 12 after an assault. He escaped and joined the Army in 1954, experiencing racial segregation and learning to box while in West Germany.</p>", "<p>Carter then committed a series of muggings after returning home, spending four years in various state prisons. He began his pro boxing career in 1961 after his release, winning 20 of his first 24 fights mostly by stoppage.</p>", "<p>Carter was fairly short for a middleweight at 5-foot-8, but his aggression and high punch volume made him effective.</p>", "<p>His shaved head and menacing glower gave him an imposing ring presence, but also contributed to a menacing aura outside the ring. He was also quoted as joking about killing police officers in a 1964 story in the Saturday Evening Post which was later cited by Carter as a cause of his troubles with police.</p>", "<p>Carter boxed regularly on television at Madison Square Garden and overseas in London, Paris and Johannesburg. Although his career appeared to be on a downswing before he was implicated in the murders, Carter was hoping for a second middleweight title shot.</p>", "<p>Carter and Artis were questioned after being spotted in the area of the murders in Carter's white car, which vaguely matched witnesses' descriptions. Both cited alibis and were released, but were arrested months later.

Marco Rubio, R-Florida, found himself in the crosshairs Tuesday, as both Chris Christie and the Jeb Bush-aligned super PAC, Right to  Rise USA, took issue with his Senate attendance record and missed national security briefings.</p>", "<p>Christie, at his own town hall event in eastern Iowa, not far from Rubio's, went after the freshman senator for his attendance record and specifically, for skipping the latest vote on the omnibus spending bill to fund the government.</p>", "<p>\"Dude, show up to work,\" Christie said, \"show up to work and vote no.  And if you don't like it, quit!\"</p>", "<p>Christie added, \"He gives a good speech, Marco, and I want to hear his  stirring speech that's going to try to persuade people on the floor of the Senate not to vote for this awful spending bill.\"</p>", "<p>Speaking to reporters after his town hall in Clinton, IA, Rubio responded  to Christie, pointing to his record as New Jersey governor and suggesting that Christie was \"a little desperate\" in his attacks, as voting day nears in the early states.</p>", "<p>\"You know, Chris has been missing in New Jersey for half the time, but  candidates, I think as we get down the stretch here, some of them get a little desperate and a little nasty in their attacks\" Rubio said, adding, \"That's fine. We're going to continue to campaign on what I'm going to do when I'm president.\"</p>", "<p>Right to Rise USA, the super PAC supporting Jeb Bush, released a television  ad that will begin airing in Iowa this week. It criticizes Rubio for missing national security briefings after the terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, California -- and instead attending political fundraisers in California and New Orleans.</p>", "<p>Like Christie, the 30-second ad also points out Rubio's missed votes  in the Senate and ends with the tagline, \"Politics first, that's the Rubio way.\" Here's the Right to Rise ad:</p>", "<p>Rubio complained that the ad \"isn't accurate\" and went on to  explain that his role on the Senate Intelligence Committee gives him access to the information \"a whole day before the rest of the Senate,\" and he'd already been fully briefed on the material.</p>", "<p>He suggested Bush's heavy campaign spending and consistently low poll  numbers motivated this latest attack.</p>", "<p>\"I mean obviously we've seen that as we get closer to election day, and  millions and millions of dollars of spending have not changed his fortunes, he's become increasingly negative in his attacks. This is not new,\" Rubio said. Then, reprising a line he used during a GOP debate last month, he added, \"Someone's convinced him that attacking  me is going to help him win.\"</p>", "<p>One person who did not attack Rubio today was Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-SC),  who traveled to Iowa for the first time with Rubio in order to endorse the Florida senator and explain to voters in Iowa why he chose Rubio over the rest of the GOP field.</p>", "<p>\"It's not my job to tell you who to vote for, but I am going to tell  you who I am going to vote for. And I'm gonna tell you why. I'm going to vote for Marco Rubio\" Gowdy said during his introduction of Rubio.  </p>", "<p>\"National security and public safety are the most important issues to  me. And there is nobody better on those two issues than Marco Rubio\" Gowdy acknowledged.</p>", "<p>Rubio's stance on immigration has been target for opponents and an issue  that has caused reluctance among voters. Gowdy, the chairman of the House Subcommittee on Immigration and Border Security, attempted to put those worries to rest, explaining that immigration was a national security issue and one that Rubio was well-equipped  to handle as president. </p>", "<p>\"If I didn't think Marco Rubio was good on border security, interior  security and employment security, I would have kept myself in South Carolina. I wouldn't be in Iowa right now.\" Gowdy added.</p>", "<p>And Gowdy also joked about Rubio's bona fides  as a fiscal conservative with a holiday anecdote.</p>", "<p>\"If you want to know whether or not Marco Rubio is a fiscal conservative,  do what I did two weeks ago -- do a gift exchange with him over Christmas. The wrapping paper costs more than the tie, it was a Rubio for Senate tie from 2010 that he gave me. So, make no mistake, he is a fiscal conservative.\"</p>"], "article_author": ["Sean Gallitz"]}

On Feb. 1 last year, the likely front-runner and 2012 nominee, Mitt Romney, had just announced he'd step aside for a politician of the new generation. The Des Moines Register (DMR)/Bloomberg <a href=\"http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/iowa-poll/2015/01/31/iowa-poll-walker-leads-tight-pack/22659477/\">Iowa Poll</a> was showing Scott Walker, Rand Paul, Mike Huckabee and Ben Carson leading the pack (Trump had 1 percent support, Cruz 6 percent and Marco Rubio 4 percent).</p>", "<p>On the Democratic side, Clinton's domination of the race was a foregone conclusion in Iowa. In that same poll, she registered 56 percent support, while Sanders foundered at 5 percent. The <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/bernie-sanders-talks-about-his-brand-of-socialism/\">idea of a socialist winning</a> any early contest seemed faintly outlandish at the time.</p>", "<p>While it's always the case that the earliest polls taken a year out from the race have little bearing on the contest, it is still a little startling to see how the race has turned utterly upside down. The poll out this weekend by DMR/Bloomberg shows Trump<a href=\"http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2016/01/30/closer-look-gops-iowa-poll-results/79566664/\"> leading</a> Cruz 28-23 percent with Rubio at 15, while Walker ended up walking away from the race before it officially began.

Clinton brought out her husband, former President Bill Clinton, and her daughter Chelsea to drum up enthusiasm in an effort to counter Sanders' huge crowds around the state.</p>", "<p>Only John Kasich is eschewing the state entirely. He's in New Hampshire Monday for three events, and Jeb Bush is splitting his time, with one Iowa midday event before he sprints out to New Hampshire, where he's vying against Bush, Chris Christie and Rubio for the establishment nod.</p>", "<p>We say it every four years -- and it's still true -- that turnout will make the difference. Broadly speaking, it's evident that huge turnout will work in the favor of Trump and Sanders, who are relying heavily on new voters to caucus. Low turnout suggests that the well-organized traditional caucus-goers of Cruz and Clinton could prevail.</p>", "<p>For Trump, all eyes are on whether his support is simply made up of Trump fans or actual caucus-goers. \"One thing everyone agrees on: his crowds are the biggest of any non-incumbent Republican caucus campaign in history, and many haven't caucused before,\" Iowa Republican strategist Tim Albrecht points out. \"Will they show up?\"</p>", "<p>\"I don't have to win it,\" Trump <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-i-dont-have-to-win-iowa/\">told</a> \"Face the Nation\" moderator John Dickerson. \"But I think it would be really good to win Iowa. I'd like to win Iowa....I think we have a good chance of winning Iowa.\"</p>", "<p>Cruz, meantime, is banking on a deeply-researched data targeting program, a large campaign organization, and what he calls \"the old Reagan coalition coming together\" to boost him to victory.</p>", "<p>\"We're seeing conservatives and evangelicals and libertarians and Reagan Democrats. And if conservatives come out, we're going to win tomorrow,\" Cruz said on \"Fox News Sunday.\"</p>", "<p>It's a similar situation on the Democratic side, as political observers shared specific benchmarks that would bode well for Sanders. \"If the turnout crosses the 160-170,000 mark what that means is Bernie expanded the electorate and that makes a difference,\" said former Iowa Democratic Party chairman Scott Brennan.</p>", "<p>Jerry Crawford, Hillary Clinton's Midwest co-chairman, is looking at the big counties.</p>", "<p>\"The first thing to watch for is what is happening in Iowa's 3 biggest counties: Polk, Linn and Scott --[in other words]...Des Moines, Cedar Rapids and Davenport,\" he said.</p>", "<p><a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/huckabee-obama-win-iowa-caucuses/\">Clinton lost all three of those counties by double digits in 2008</a>, and Crawford suggested Sanders would have to beat her there soundly to overcome her \"more uniform strength statewide.\"</p>", "<p><em>CBS News Digital Journalist Kylie Atwood contributed to this report.</em></p>"], "article_author": ["Steve Chaggaris"]}

That's not a level playing field. That's not a fair system.\"  </p>", "<p>She said the answer to the problem is more regulation and tax reforms since Washington works for \"those who can hire an army of lobbyists and an army of lawyers,\" not regular families. </p>", "<p>\"If we don't make that fundamental change, we're just going to live in a world where the rich keep getting richer, the powerful keep getting more powerful, and everybody else falls behind.\"</p>", "<p>Warren highlighted a couple of specific areas she'd like to see progress on. <br></p>", "<p> \"I'm out here working on the issues we need to work on right now, and I got to say, we need to refinance the student loan debt that's outstanding.

He's an established political figure in his own right, boasting a vast resume and a deep well of political contacts after 30-plus years in the Senate. He's a savvy retail politician who's demonstrated an ability to connect with his audience on a visceral level. And he's <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/joe-biden-warns-democrats-dont-let-gop-steal-credit-for-economic-recovery/\" target=\"_blank\">fluent in the populist language about middle class opportunity and inequality that Democrats are already using to frame the 2016 election</a>.</p>", "<p>In a normal election year, that kind of record could make Biden an early favorite for his party's nod - but 2016 is not looking like a normal election year. For one, early primary polls indicate a huge majority of Democrats see former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton - not Biden - as the president's heir-apparent.</p>", "<p>The vice president also faces doubts about his age - he would be 74 on Election Day 2016. And while his fulsome public speaking can endear him to his audiences, it also carries the potential for gaffes.</p>", "<p>And in spite of his age, it seems that Biden is in no hurry. He is waiting for something that will help make up his mind. He has kept the door open to a run, insisting he won't be dissuaded by his competition or his age. And he may soon pick up the pace of visits to states with early voting contests. He dropped by Iowa last week and a visit to South Carolina is coming. </p>", "<p>He has not, however, shown any signs of laying any groundwork for a campaign, the Associated Press points out. Biden has a lot of friends in these states from his decades in politics, but he has not set up any exploratory committees, PACs or begun to hire the kind of key staff necessary for primary season. The AP quoted Biden on his trip to Des Moines, Iowa, last week, \"I've been here a lot, I have a lot of friends, I'm going to see some of my friends (in the Legislature)...I'm not doing any organization, if that's what you mean.\"  </p>", "<p>Biden, who has run two presidential campaigns already, will not be hurried in deciding on a third. He has said more than once that he'd decide on whether to run by the end of summer.</p>", "<p>Joseph Robinette Biden, Jr., was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, in 1942, the oldest of four siblings in an Irish Catholic family. His upbringing was marked by some hardship, as his father struggled to find enough work to support the family. It was an experience that profoundly shaped Biden's worldview.</p>", "<p>\"Dad never failed to remind us that a job is about a lot more than a paycheck,\" he said during his speech at the 2008 Democratic National Convention. \"It's about your dignity. It's about respect.\"</p>", "<p>Tad Devine, a Democratic strategist who's working with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, one of Biden's potential primary rivals, told CBS News Biden's working class background could be a strong selling point in 2016.</p>", "<p>\"The next election is likely to be about the great economic division that's occurring in America right now,\" Devine said. \"Biden will have an easy time talking about it because he can talk about it from his own perspective, his own story.\"</p>", "<p>Julian Zelizer, a presidential historian at Princeton University, argued Biden can speak to middle class concerns more fluently than Clinton, who has at times struggled to project the kind of populism that comes naturally to the vice president. \"He's in some ways very much a New Deal Democrat who's concerned about what the government does to help the middle class,\" Zelizer explained. \"I don't think it's hard for him to talk about this. This is who he is.\"</p>", "<p>Biden met his first wife, Neilia Hunter, in 1964, and the two married in 1966. He attended law school at Syracuse University after college at the University of Delaware. In 1972, after a brief stint in local politics, he ran for the U.S. Senate against an incumbent nobody expected him to beat. He pulled out a narrow victory, becoming the sixth youngest senator to be elected in U.S. history.</p>", "<p>In December 1972, after his victory but before he assumed office, Biden's wife and infant daughter were killed in a car crash in Delaware. Biden considered resigning to care for his sons Hunter and Beau, who were injured in the same wreck, but he ultimately decided to keep his day job. Over the next few decades, Biden would commute every day by train to work in Washington, D.C. from Delaware to be able to care for his sons, earning the nickname \"Amtrak Joe.\"</p>", "<p>Devine says the trauma of that experience gave Biden \"a tremendous amount of empathy for people who are dealing with difficult situations,\" and he said that empathy has allowed Biden to connect with people on a gut level throughout his long career.</p>", "<p>In the Senate, Biden dove into foreign and domestic affairs, at times chairing both the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Senate Judiciary Committee. Among other accomplishments, he played a key role in defeating the nomination of Robert Bork to the Supreme Court in 1987, and he was credited with shepherding the Violence Against Women Act to passage in 1994 - a legislative achievement he's described as the \"most significant\" of his career.</p>", "<p>Biden first ran for president in 1988, but that bid was ultimately felled by a plagiarism scandal. Shortly after he dropped out of that race, he nearly died of a ruptured brain aneurysm. A second aneurysm was discovered shortly thereafter, but it was removed before it burst. Since his brush with mortality, Biden has enjoyed a relatively clean bill of health.</p>", "<p>He ran for president again in 2008 but failed to gain traction against Clinton and Obama, who were the dominant figures in the race. After a disappointing fifth place showing in the Iowa Caucuses, he dropped out. Then-Sen. Obama selected Biden as his running mate in August 2008, and the two cruised to victory in November and assumed office the following January.</p>", "<p>As vice president, Biden has said he's frequently \"the last person in the room\" when Mr. Obama makes a decision. His first major task was <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-sheriff-in-town/\" target=\"_blank\">overseeing the implementation of the $787 billion stimulus package</a>, and he's been credited with keeping the waste, fraud, and abuse in the massive spending bill to a minimum. He's also been Mr. Obama's go-to negotiator with congressional Republicans, helping to broker a series of fiscal deals with Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. He was an aggressive voice within the administration advocating the drawdown U.S. troops from Iraq and Afghanistan, often disagreeing with Mr. Obama's other advisers on the issue, and he chaired the gun violence task force the president commissioned in the wake of the <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/feature/elementary-school-rampage/\" target=\"_blank\">2012 shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut</a>.</p>", "<p>\"He hasn't been quiet, that's for sure,\" Zelizer said, describing Biden as a very consequential force within the administration. \"He's served as a liaison to Congress in an administration that has problems with congressional relations, [and] he's been a voice for issues that sometimes the administration or the president for either political or strategic reasons isn't willing to talk about.\"</p>", "<p>More than any other Democrat, Biden will own the record of the Obama administration if he decides to run for president in 2016. The <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/obamas-approval-rating-ticks-up-in-2015/\">latest CBS News poll</a> shows that 46 percent of Americans approve of the job Mr. Obama is doing, and the same percentage disapprove. Most Democrats give him credit for bringing the U.S. economy back, and that could give Biden a leg up in the primary. \"The fact that he's been such a strong V.P. and so supportive of the president has put him in good standing with Democratic primary voters,\" Devine said.</p>", "<p>But that association could complicate a general election campaign, particularly if Mr. Obama's approval ratings remain under 50 percent, and the Democratic nominee is forced to seek some distance from the current administration. Biden still signaled the opposite during a recent speech in Iowa, saying that <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/hillary-clinton-obamas-third-term/\" target=\"_blank\">he's prepared to go to the mat defending the administration</a> - and he warned other Democrats that they'll have to do the same. So part of Biden's calculus for running may well depend which direction the president's approval takes.</p>", "<p>\"Those seeking to lead the nation should protect and defend and run, yes run, on what we've done; own what we have done,\" he said. \"Some say that would amount to a third term of the president. I call it sticking with what works and what we oughta do.\"</p>", "<p>Biden has often boasted, \"No one ever doubts I mean what I say, [but] sometimes I say all that I mean.\" This penchant for candid, off-script moments lends him the kind of authenticity many political figures will never be able to cultivate.</p>", "<p>Biden's \"propensity to say what he thinks is an asset, not a liability,\" Devine said. \"People are desperate for politicians who will tell the truth. If you show up and you're really leveling with people, even if they don't agree with you, you're going to get a lot of points.\"</p>", "<p>But his frank, sometimes off-color commentary <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/videos/biden-apologizes-for-gaffe-that-angered-mideast-allies/\" target=\"_blank\">has also opened Biden to criticism at times</a>, and some Democrats privately worry that he's too undisciplined a messenger to carry the party to victory in 2016.</p>", "<p>\"There's tons of fear about that\" within the Democratic Party, Zelizer said. \"You just don't know what he's going to say.\"</p>", "<p>Here's a look at some of the moments when Biden has seemed to trip over his tongue:</p>", "<p>Perhaps the biggest impediment to a Biden candidacy in 2016 is the dominance of Clinton over the rest of the potential primary field, even though she has yet to declare her candidacy.</p>", "<p>As senators and members of the Obama administration, <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/amid-2016-speculation-hillary-clinton-and-biden-meet/\" target=\"_blank\">Biden and Clinton have forged a strong friendship and partnership through the years</a>, and many doubt that Biden would run against Clinton if she decides to launch a bid - an outcome that looks all but certain at this point.</p>", "<p>\"Everybody recognizes that Hillary's going to be an enormously formidable candidate in the nominating process,\" Devine said. \"She's going to be really tough for Biden or for anyone else to take on.\"</p>", "<p>\"The vice president should be the person to get [the nomination],\" Zelizer added, \"but that's not going to happen here.\" He argued Clinton would \"really have to show some sign of weakness\" to give Biden an opening.</p>", "<p>If Clinton doesn't run, Biden would have a far easier time claiming the nomination, thanks to his deep resume and high name recognition. Even so, he'd likely have to fend off challenges from other Democrats whose plans have, to date, been effectively frozen by Clinton.</p>", "<p>But Biden's age could also weigh heavily on his decision about a 2016 presidential run. As mentioned before, he will be 74 years old on Election Day 2016 - older than any U.S. president ever elected to a first term. </p>", "<p>\"I do think it's a factor,\" Zelizer said of Biden's age. \"Right now there's a preference for a little younger candidate...Being an older white man will say to some voters, this is the same kind of Democrat. We're at a moment when the party wants newness.\" And while Clinton would face some of the same concerns -- she'll be 69 on Election Day -- the prospect of a female commander in chief would lend her an aura of freshness that Biden will lack, Zelizer argued.</p>", "<p>Still, the vice president enjoys a reputation for vitality and exuberance that could help diminish concerns about his advanced age - watch the man work a rope line and thunder his message from a podium, and you begin to understand why. Devine said, \"This is not a guy who looks like he's looking for a wheelchair - he's a very active guy.\" </p>"], "article_author": ["Jake Miller"]}

And for <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/hillary-clinton-hints-at-2016-campaign-talks-womens-issues-at-conference/\" target=\"_blank\">Hillary Clinton, the party's undeclared frontrunner</a>, that could potentially be a big problem.</p>", "<p>When Webb retired from the Senate in 2013 after only one term, many assumed his decision to forego reelection marked his exit from the political stage. He was always an outsider, never cultivating deep ties with Democratic donors and party elders during his time in Washington. And at 69 years old, he's probably not eyeing a future in electoral politics beyond 2016.</p>", "<p>\"He's always been an unnatural political animal,\" Webb's Senate campaign manager Steve Jarding said with a laugh. \"And I don't say that pejoratively.\"</p>", "<p>Last November, though, Webb jumped back into the fray, surprising observers by <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/jim-webb-forms-exploratory-committee-for-white-house-2016-bid/\" target=\"_blank\">becoming the first Democrat to take the step of forming a committee to explore a presidential bid in 2016</a>.  In his announcement video, he warned that America was at a \"serious crossroads\" and touted his own record of leadership.</p>", "<p>To say that Webb would begin the 2016 race as a longshot might be considered charitable, given Clinton's early dominance. But it's clear he can't be dismissed out of hand.</p>", "<p>A former Marine and decorated war hero, Webb was an assistant secretary of defense and secretary of the U.S. Navy before becoming a senator. He has no shortage of gravitas. </p>", "<p>He's also aggressively opposed recent foreign military incursions and championed efforts to rein in Wall Street - both positions that could endear him to the Democratic base, which is seeking a progressive alternative to the Clinton juggernaut.</p>", "<p>Webb is not exactly the ideal champion of the left, though. He's staked out more conservative positions on gun control, affirmative action, immigration, and environmental issues that could be problematic if he hopes to become a progressive favorite.</p>", "<p>It is, in all, an unusual but intriguing record. And it has some wondering whether Webb could emerge as a real player in 2016.</p>", "<p>\"He brings a certain level of prestige and gravitas to the debate, a kind of working class appeal,\" said Jarding.</p>", "<p>\"Webb certainly passes the 'threshold of credibility' standard...He could become a serious candidate,\" added Tad Devine, a veteran Democratic strategist who's advising Sen. Bernie Sanders, another potential 2016 candidate.</p>", "<p>Veteran D.C. journalist Al Hunt put it most succinctly last year: \"Jim Webb could be Hillary Clinton's worst nightmare.\"</p>", "<p>Webb was born in Missouri in 1946 to a military family that relocated frequently during his youth. He graduated from high school in Nebraska and spent a year at the University of Southern California before finishing undergrad in 1968 at the U.S. Naval Academy.</p>", "<p>After college, Webb was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Marine Corps and sent to Vietnam. He distinguished himself in the war, earning a Navy Cross, two Purple hearts, the Silver Star and two Bronze Stars, and he was soon promoted to first lieutenant. Due to several injuries he sustained while fighting, Webb was granted a medical retirement shortly after he returned home.</p>", "<p>He received his law degree from Georgetown University in 1975 and soon joined the staff of the House Committee on Veteran's Affairs. In 1984, Webb was appointed Assistant Secretary of Defense under then-President Ronald Reagan, and in 1987, Reagan appointed him Secretary of the Navy. He resigned from the post in 1988 due to a dispute over the size of the Navy and spent the next few years as a filmmaker and author.</p>", "<p>In 2006, Webb ran as a Democrat against then-Sen. George Allen, R-Virginia. He campaigned as a strong opponent of the Bush administration's war in Iraq, famously wearing the combat boots of his son, who was fighting overseas, at all of his campaign events. Allen was heavily favored to win the race at the outset, but after he came under fire for directing the slur \"macaca\" at a South Asian man tracking one of his events , <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/senate-tips-democratic/\" target=\"_blank\">Webb surged to victory, pulling off the most surprising Senate victories in recent memory</a>.</p>", "<p>\"Some people called it the upset of the century,\" recalled Jarding. \"There was no way in hell Jim Webb was going to win that race, and everybody knew it, except Jim Webb.\"</p>", "<p>As senator, Webb was remembered primarily for delivering a well-received Democratic response to Mr. Bush's 2007 State of the Union address, and for his efforts to pass a 21st century G.I. bill enabling more veterans to go to college and receive job training.</p>", "<p>Much of Webb's political persona draws on his heritage as a Scotch-Irish American with roots in Appalachia and Middle America. He's counseled Democrats not to give up on attracting the white, working-class voters who have sided against them in recent elections, and he's calibrated his message to appeal to dispossessed Americans in both rural and urban areas.</p>", "<p>That's led him to embrace a type of economic populism, supporting efforts to tackle income inequality and rein in Wall Street. But it's also allowed him to stake out more conservative positions on cultural issues like gun control and affirmative action.</p>", "<p><strong>Gun Control</strong></p>", "<p>While much of his party has supported stricter restrictions on gun ownership in America, Webb has taken a different tack by emphasizing the importance of Second Amendment rights.  As a senator, he voted to allow firearms in checked baggage on Amtrak trains, he supported a measure to prohibit the provision of foreign aid to any organization seeking to impose registration or tax requirements on U.S. gun owners, and he sponsored a proposal allowing veterans to register an unlicensed gun they acquire while abroad.</p>", "<p>In 2007, after an aide in his Senate office was arrested for trying to bring a gun into the Capitol complex, Webb distanced himself from the episode but took the opportunity to offer a rousing defense of the right to bear arms. \"I believe wherever you see places where people are allowed to carry, generally the violence goes down,\" he said.</p>", "<p><strong>Affirmative Action</strong></p>", "<p>Webb has also distinguished himself from the rest of his party by opposing race-based affirmative action programs in the college admissions process. He's argued that the programs once helped address the legacy of institutional racism, but that they now provide a misleading read on the face of poverty in America, disadvantaging poor, white kids from rural areas. In a 2010 Wall Street Journal op-ed, Webb called for a switch from race-based programs to need-based assistance programs that would help poor students of all races.</p>", "<p>\"Those who came to this country in recent decades from Asia, Latin America and Africa did not suffer discrimination from our government, and in fact have frequently been the beneficiaries of special government programs,\" he wrote. \"The same cannot be said of many hard-working white Americans, including those whose roots in America go back more than 200 years.\"</p>", "<p>In a speech last year at the National Press Club, Webb said the experience of white Americans in downtrodden rural areas undermines the \"false premise that if you are white, you by definition have begun with some kind of socioeconomic advantage.\"</p>", "<p><strong>Economic Policy</strong></p>", "<p>In Webb's 2007 State of the Union response, he argued that America's economic health should be measured \"not with the numbers that come out of Wall Street, but with the living conditions that exist on Main Street.\"</p>", "<p>That kind of economic populism has lent itself to a number of proposals to crack down on the financial services industry and promote economic opportunity and mobility. As a senator, he supported a measure to tax any bonus given to an executive at any big bank or financial firm that received government assistance during the crisis of 2008. He also pushed for a hike in capital gains taxes in 2011, arguing it would help address the growing problem of income inequality.</p>", "<p><strong>Foreign Policy</strong></p>", "<p>Webb's earlier career in the military and his work at the Defense Department spoke to a generally hawkish take on the use of American military power - he's defended the reasoning behind the U.S. war in Vietnam, for example. But since he entered the political fray in 2006, he's been a strong opponent of U.S. military interventions.</p>", "<p>He was a vocal critic of the second Iraq war, dubbing President Bush's decision to invade in 2002 America's worst strategic blunder in recent memory. He opposed President Obama's decision to use U.S. military force to help oust Libyan dictator Moammar Qaddafi in 2011, and he's spoken out against those who advocate arming Syrian rebels to fight Islamic extremists and government thugs in that country.</p>", "<p>\"There is no such thing as the right of any President to unilaterally decide to use force in combat operations based on such vague concepts as \"humanitarian intervention,\" Webb said in his speech at the National Press Club. \"If a treaty does not obligate us, if American forces are not under attack or under threat of imminent attack, if no Americans are at risk, the president should come to the congress before he or she sends troops into harm's way.\"</p>", "<p>Of the non-Clinton Democrats eyeing a bid in 2016, some believe Webb may be the most willing to attack the party's ostensible frontrunner.</p>", "<p>Vice President Joe Biden is seen as too collegial with Clinton to attack her directly, and the same is true of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren is beloved by progressives, but she's repeatedly said she won't run in 2016. Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley is making early moves to position himself as the progressive alternative to Clinton, but there are questions about how aggressive he's willing to be - would he attack his party's likely nominee if he knew it meant sacrificing a political future beyond 2016?</p>", "<p>That leaves Webb, a man who's rarely shied away from a political fight he deems worthwhile.</p>", "<p>\"I think he's used to the rough and tumble of politics, and I think that he's very different from Biden or Sanders, for example,\" Devine explained. \"Part of Webb's whole appeal is going to be that he's a tough guy....I could see Webb being a tough guy on Hillary to try to prove that he'd be a tough guy on [possible 2016 GOP nominee Jeb] Bush later on.\"</p>", "<p>Webb's progressive positions on economic issues and his outspoken opposition to foreign entanglements could resonate with Democratic primary voters, especially given Clinton's own close ties to Wall Street and her relatively hawkish profile on defense issues. </p>", "<p>\"The anti-war folks will love Jim, the anti-Wall Street folks will love Jim,\" said Jarding. </p>", "<p>Larry Sabato, a political science professor at the University of Virginia, said Webb  \"could use both issues to some effect should he run.\"</p>", "<p>\"A sizable minority of Democrats has not yet cast its lot with Clinton, and some will vote for a credible opponent in the primaries and caucuses,\" Sabato said. \"Jim Webb has a distinguished record, including a Senate term, so he qualifies.\"</p>", "<p>The problem, though, is that Webb's stated beliefs don't always place him to Clinton's left: he's more of ideological hodge-podge than a progressive champion. To court the left, he'd need to explain some conservative positions on cultural issues, along with some of his earlier hawkish views on foreign policy.</p>", "<p>\"If you're going to challenge Clinton, you have to do it from the left, not the center,\" said Devine. \"Webb certainly has a lot of populist appeal, but if you look at his record, going back to service in the Reagan administration, he's got a lot of positions on issues...and things he's said in the past that will position him to Clinton's right.\"</p>", "<p>\"When you get Jim Webb, you get Jim Webb. You get the polish, you get the warts, but this is not a guy who's going to take the easy path to electoral politics,\" Jarding said. \"I don't think he's going to necessarily going to compromise at levels that a lot of folks would like him to compromise.\"</p>", "<p>On a more mechanical level, it's not clear Webb (or any Democrat) will be able to raise the funds needed to mount a serious bid, given Clinton's forbidding early dominance.</p>", "<p>\"The biggest and toughest benchmark for him is going to be -- can he put together the resources to run a national campaign?\" Devine said. \"I don't think there's any doubt that he has credibility in terms of his substance.\"</p>", "<p>\"He wasn't the best campaigner, he detested fundraising,\" admitted Jarding. \" A lot of candidates find campaigning very taxing, they hate to raise money, and they just won't admit it. But he did.\"</p>", "<p>As he considers his strategy going forward, Webb has been decidedly coy about criticizing Clinton thus far. He told a radio interviewer <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/jim-webb-presidential-speculation-follows-ex-virginia-senator-to-iowa/\" target=\"_blank\">during a visit to Iowa last August</a>, for example, that it would \"take up the whole show\" for him to critique Clinton's record as secretary of state.</p>", "<p>\"I think there's time to have that discussion later,\" he added, winking at the likelihood of fireworks to come.</p>"], "article_author": ["Jake Miller"]}

Well this is a bad deal.  It's a very bad deal. We're better off without it,\" Netanyahu told a joint meeting of the House and Senate Tuesday in an address frequently punctuated by applause and cheers.</p>", "<p>Netanyahu is a staunch opponent of the ongoing negotiations, fearing that it will allow Iranian leaders to continue secretly building a nuclear bomb that could pose a major threat to Israel's security. But the nature of his speech - two weeks before the Israeli elections, and at the <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/john-boehner-invites-israeli-prime-minister-benjamin-netanyahu-to-address-congress/\">sole invitation of House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio</a> - has injected his appearance with a degree of partisanship and caused some friction in the U.S.-Israeli relationship.</p>", "<p>A large portion of Netanyahu's 40-minute speech was dedicated to outlining his concerns about the outlines of a deal, which the administration has yet to reveal publicly. He said it leaves Iran with a \"vast\" nuclear infrastructure and relies on investigators to stop them from using it to create a nuclear weapon - and Iran \"plays a pretty good game of hide and cheat\" with inspectors, he said. </p>", "<p>Netanyahu also said that nearly all restrictions on the regime's nuclear program would expire in a decade, alongside all U.S. sanctions, and he posited that this would enable them to create a nuclear arsenal \"in a matter of weeks.\"</p>", "<p>\"Iran could have the means to deliver that nuclear arsenal to the far reaching corners of the earth including to every part of the United States,\" Netanyahu said. \"That's why this deal is so bad. It doesn't block Iran's path to the bomb. It paves Iran's path to the bomb.\"</p>", "<p>This, he said, would \"spark a nuclear arms race in the most dangerous part of the planet\" because many of Iran's neighbors say they would respond to a nuclear Iran by building nuclear weapons of their own.</p>", "<p>\"This deal won't be a farewell to arms; it would be a farewell to arms control,\" Netanyahu said. If his predictions came true, it would be a major blow to President Obama's stated goal of reducing the world' nuclear weapons.</p>", "<p>He said he disagrees with the pretense that inking a deal will either lead Iran to change, or leave the world safer than not negotiating with Iran's leaders at all.</p>", "<p>Mr. Obama, who did not watch the speech live and read a transcript of the speech, s<a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/obama-nothing-new-netanyahu-speech/\">aid it contained \"nothing new\"</a> and that Netanyahu was not proposing a viable alternative to a deal that allows the the world to monitor Iran's nuclear activity.</p>", "<p>\"It may be that Iran cannot say yes to a good deal. I have repeatedly said that I would rather have no deal than a bad deal. But if we're successful in negotiating, then in fact this will be the best deal possible to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Nothing else comes close,\" Mr. Obama told reporters following a meeting with Defense Secretary Ashton Carter Tuesday afternoon. \"Sanctions won't do it, even military action would not be as successful as the deal that we have put forward.</p>", "<p>Netanyahu did not reject the idea that a deal with Iran is impossible, but he suggested the negotiators were approaching the talks in the wrong way by moving too quickly to lift sanctions. He outlined three conditions the world should demand for lifting economic penalties: Iran must stop aggression against its neighbors in the Middle East, stop supporting terrorism around the globe, and stop threatening to destroy Israel.</p>", "<p>\"If the world powers are not prepared to insist that Iran change its behavior before a deal is signed, at the very least they should insist that Iran change its behavior before a deal expires,\" Netanyahu said. \"If Iran wants to be treated like a normal country, let it act like a normal country.\"</p>", "<p>To underscore his point, Netanyahu began the speech with a long recitation of acts of terror Iran is purported to have supported, including the bombing of the U.S. marine barracks in Beirut in 1983. He also warned that it is expanding its influence in the Middle East, and said Iran now \"dominates\" the capitals of Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen.</p>", "<p>And he suggested that Israel would take matters into its own hands if it feels unsafe.</p>", "<p>\"The days when the Jewish people remained passive in the face of genocidal enemies, those days are over,\" he said. \"As a prime minister of Israel, I can promise you one more thing: Even if Israel has to stand alone, Israel will stand.\"</p>", "<p>Dozens of Democrats in the House and Senate  <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/five-things-netanyahu-speech-congress/\">skipped the address</a>, giving a range of reasons from objecting to the timing of the speech so close to Israeli elections to the fact that the invitation was issued by only Boehner, and was not bipartisan.</p>", "<p>But even some who attended were not pleased with what they heard.</p>", "<p>House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, said in a statement, \"As one who values the U.S. - Israel relationship, and loves Israel, I was near tears throughout the Prime Minister's speech - saddened by the insult to the intelligence of the United States as part of the P5 +1 nations, and saddened by the condescension toward our knowledge of the threat posed by Iran and our broader commitment to preventing nuclear proliferation.\"</p>", "<p>Mr. Obama will <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/obama-will-not-meet-with-netanyahu-this-march/\">not meet with Netanyahu</a> during his visit, citing a precedent that U.S. officials have a longstanding practice of not meeting with foreign leaders so close to their elections. Israel's elections take place on March 17. In an interview on \"CBS This Morning\" co-host Charlie Rose's PBS program last week, President Obama's national security adviser, Susan Rice, <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/israeli-prime-minister-netanyahu-declines-democrats-request-to-meet/\">called Netanyahu's visit \"destructive.\"</a> Boehner has <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/netanyahu-speech-congress-demand-tickets-boehner/\">accused the administration of attacking</a> the Israeli prime minister.</p>", "<p>\"I deeply regret that some perceived by my being here as political. That was never my intention,\" Netanyahu said as he began his speech Tuesday.</p>", "<p>He clearly sought to extend an olive branch to the president, noting early in his speech the ways that the president has helped Israel both in public and behind the scenes.</p>", "<p>\"Some of what the president has done for Israel might never be known, because it touches on some of the most sensitive and strategic issues that arise between an American president and an Israeli prime minister,\" He said. \"But I know it, and I will always be grateful to President Obama for that support.\"</p>", "<p>Secretary of State John Kerry is in Switzerland working to reach a deal before <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/u-s-tells-iran-to-consider-extending-nuclear-negotiations/\">a March 31 deadline</a>. Iran says it wants to enrich uranium for energy, medical and scientific purposes, but the U.S. and its allies want to ensure it cannot use the program to build a nuclear weapon. In return, the world powers in talks with Iran would gradually lift the economic sanctions that have crippled its economy.</p>", "<p>In an <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/obama-iran-should-freeze-nuclear-activity-for-10-years/\">interview with Reuters Monday</a>, the president said Iran should agree to freeze its nuclear activity for at least 10 years in order to reach an agreement over the issue with the United States and its allies.</p>", "<p>\"If, in fact, Iran is willing to agree to double-digit years of keeping their program where it is right now and, in fact, rolling back elements of it that currently exist ... if we've got that, and we've got a way of verifying that, there's no other steps we can take that would give us such assurance that they don't have a nuclear weapon,\" Mr. Obama said.</p>", "<p>He also said the odds are against Iran reaching a deal with United States and the rest of the so-called P5 +1, which also includes Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia.</p>", "<p>Mr. Obama acknowledged to Reuters Monday that there is a \"substantial disagreement\" between the U.S. and Israel over how to curb Iran's nuclear ambitions. He called Netanyahu's speech to Congress a distraction, though he said it would not be \"permanently destructive\" to the United States' relationship with Israel.</p>"], "article_author": ["Rebecca Kaplan"]}

He'd come to the White House press room to speak about the massacre in Charleston, South Carolina. The room, with its low ceiling and tight quarters, matched his mood. It's a venue for tiny political fights relentlessly pursued in circles. The president testified to that lack of progress, showing visible frustration with his impotence in the face of gun violence and racial hatred. </p>", "<p>A week later, the president's mood had been transformed--he was as expansive as his new venue, the College of Charleston's 5,000-seat arena. Out of the violence the president fashioned an argument for perseverance and found the spark for action that seemed to have been taken from him the week before. </p>", "<p><figure class=\"image pull-none image-large \"><span class=\"img \"><img src=\"http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/06/26/37e5d356-69e2-4cbd-957d-e22d4a5202ff/thumbnail/620x350/a61b97bb22204fcad8e31b57b95f42ea/obamafuneral2.jpg\" alt=\"obamafuneral2.jpg\" height=\"350\" width=\"620\"></span><figcaption><div class=\"caption\"><p>U.S. President Barack Obama delivers the eulogy in honor of Reverend Clementa Pinckney, who was also a South Carolina state senator, June 26, 2015.</p><p></p></div></figcaption></figure></p>", "<p>The spark was located in the life of <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/south-carolina-lawmakers-take-shifts-standing-by-body-of-pastor-slain-in-charleston-shooting/\" target=\"_blank\">Clementa Pinckney</a>, the state senator and pastor of the Mother Emanuel Church, whom the president was there to eulogize. It was also found in the grace he saw in the family members of the victims who had forgiven the shooter during his bond hearing, and in the reaction of the people of Charleston. </p>", "<p>\"This whole week I have been reflecting on this idea of grace,\" the president said. He sure had. The speech wasn't just a testimony about grace, it was a demonstration of it. </p>", "<p>After talking about Pinckney, the president turned to the subject of grace and at that point, he stopped speaking sentences, but instead lines from the hymn \"Amazing Grace.\" In his rhetoric and in his preacher's cadence, he was now praising Pinckney by channeling him. Then, for those not used to spending time in the pews, the president as professor returned. \"According to the Christian tradition, grace is not earned, grace is not merited, it is not something we deserve ... grace is the free and benevolent favor of God.\"</p>", "<p>Obama gave that Sunday school definition because he was preparing to make an argument. It was the preamble to the most religious speech of his presidency and one of the most overtly religious speeches from a president in a long while. How powerful was this grace, in the president's vision? It had acted through the killer, who the president portrayed as an unwitting instrument of the Almighty: \"He didn't know he was being used by God.\" </p>", "<p>The president was no longer giving a speech about a tragedy; he was trying to leverage the grace displayed in the wake of that heinous act into a nation's purpose. \"As a nation out of this terrible tragedy, God has visited grace upon us,\" he said. \"He has allowed us to see where we have been blind.\" It was that grace, the president argued, that helped South Carolina lawmakers conclude that the Confederate flag should come down.  </p>", "<p>But there was more power in grace than simply providing the impetus to lower a flag. \"He has given us the chance where we have been lost to find our best selves,\" the president said. \"We may not have earned grace, but we got it all the same. He gave it to us anyway.\" And that means, he continued, that America has a duty: \"It is up to us now to make the most of it. To receive it with gratitude and prove ourselves worthy of this gift.\"</p>", "<p>The president then outlined the worthy fights, from lessening gun violence to tackling poverty to improving race relations. If you were moved by the response to the shooting, he was arguing, then you have a commitment to be true to what inspired that moving response. If Americans make those commitments and stay focused on improving those injustices, the president said, \"by doing that, we express God's grace.\"</p>", "<p>This was not a rhetorical exercise, or not merely one. It was a demonstration of the power the president had found in the example of the people of Charleston--both the living and the dead. He wasn't just telling. He was showing--the power he was trying to summon in this speech came from his own feeling of gratitude and obligation to serve as an example of grace. Even if you didn't agree with any of what the president said, the distance the president traveled in this one week was a kind of testimony of its own. By the end of his oration, the president was leading the congregation <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/videos/obama-sings-amazing-grace/\" target=\"_blank\">in an impromptu rendition of \"Amazing Grace.\"</a></p>", "<p>It was the second time in the day, and the third time in two days, that the president had made testimonials to the power of keeping the faith. Thursday, the Supreme Court ruled on a legislative interpretation that allowed the Affordable Care Act to survive, enshrining the president's signature legislative achievement after years of pitched battle. Friday, the Supreme Court announced that same-sex couples had a constitutional right to marry, rooted in the 14th Amendment, written in the wake of the Civil War to grant citizenship to people once enslaved.</p>", "<p>Speaking in the Rose Garden on Friday morning the president said the same-sex marriage ruling was a testament to the power of perseverance in the struggle. \"Progress on this journey often comes in small increments, sometimes two steps forward, one step back, propelled by the persistent effort of dedicated citizens. And then sometimes, there are days like this, when that slow, steady effort is rewarded with justice that arrives like a thunderbolt.\"</p>", "<p>The thunderbolts of change that struck this week seem to have energized the president. He might have given the same eulogy had he not had his opinions affirmed by the Supreme Court. But given the sense of vindication that he feels, it was easy to see how those secular victories gave him the confidence to make that soaring religious speech and to wipe away the intimations toward capitulation and defeat from just a little more than a week ago.</p>"], "article_author": ["John Dickerson"]}

Clinton has publicly insisted she sent no classified information via email.</p>", "<p>The inspectors general are required to refer such cases to the Justice Department under an <a href=\"http://fas.org/irp/agency/doj/mou-crimes.pdf\">executive order</a>  governing the release of classified information. </p>", "<p>The former officials told Crawford that referrals are not uncommon, and usually don't lead to criminal charges. A typical referral  for investigation could be the discovery of classified documents sitting on someone's desk.  </p>", "<p>But the allegations against Clinton are different and more serious.</p>", "<p>The closest parallel to Clinton is the case of former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, who <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/doj-gonzales-mishandled-top-secret-docs/\">took  classified documents home</a>\u200e and stored some of them in a safe. Even though he had no bad intent, the removal of classified  information from secure locations is not allowed because it becomes vulnerable. In Gonzales, case, the White House referred the matter to DOJ, which investigated and concluded in a lengthy report that Gonzales mishandled classified information. DOJ ultimately  decided not to prosecute him.</p>", "<p>The former officials said the \u200eClinton emails raise similar, but more troubling issues. Classified information sent on a private  network is even more vulnerable than classified information carried home in a briefcase, because there doesn't need to be physical proximity for it to be stolen-- agents in Russia or China could hack into the network.</p>", "<p>Where Clinton will run into even more serious problems, one former official said, is if investigators see a pattern. For instance,  if a State Department employee emailed her discussing details about a briefing or document that was classified, the employee has sent an email with classified information. That's a problem. If Clinton responded or forwarded the email, she too would have sent  an email containing classified information. That's also problem.

It also would distinguish Clinton's <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/hillary-clinton-used-only-personal-email-account-at-state-department/\">secretive email practices</a> as far more sophisticated than some politicians, including Mitt Romney and Sarah Palin, who were caught conducting official business using free email services operated by Microsoft Corp. and Yahoo Inc.</p>", "<p>Most Internet users rely on professional outside companies, such as Google Inc. or their employers, for the behind-the-scenes complexities of managing their email communications. Government employees generally use servers run by the federal agencies where they work.</p>", "<p>In most cases, individuals who operate their own email servers are technical experts or users so concerned about issues of privacy and surveillance they take matters into their own hands.</p>", "<p>Clinton has not described her motivation for using a private email account that traced back to her own private email server registered under an apparent pseudonym - for official State Department business.</p>", "<p>Operating her own server would have afforded Clinton additional legal opportunities to block government or private subpoenas in criminal, administrative or civil cases because her lawyers could object in court before being forced to turn over any emails. And since the Secret Service was guarding Clinton's home, an email server there would have been well protected from theft or a physical hacking.</p>", "<p>But \"homebrew\" email servers are generally not as reliable, secure from hackers or protected from fires or floods as those in commercial data centers. Those professional facilities provide monitoring for viruses or hacking attempts, regulated temperatures, off-site backups, generators in case of power outages, fire-suppression systems and redundant communications lines.</p>", "<p>A spokesman for Clinton did not respond to requests seeking comment from the AP on Tuesday.</p>", "<p>Clinton ignored the issue during a speech Tuesday night at the 30th anniversary gala of EMILY's List, which works to elect Democratic women who support abortion rights.</p>", "<p>At the event, Clinton credited women with making a difference at all levels of government, asking an audience of female Democrats, \"Don't you someday want to see a woman president?\"</p>", "<p>On the <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/election-2016/\">cusp of a second presidential campaign</a>, she previewed some of the economic themes that could animate an upcoming race, pointing to an economy that too often fails to address the challenges faced by families and working mothers.</p>", "<p>\"We have to get our economy to reflect the realities of 21st century America, and we're not doing that,\" Clinton said. \"We're not doing that when the hard work of men and women across our country is not rewarded with rising wages, but CEO pay goes up and up no matter what.\"</p>", "<p>Clinton's 30-minute address was punctuated by references to her future. She noted that during one's life, \"You get a chance to make millions of decisions. Some of them are big, like 'Do you run for office?\"'</p>", "<p>Looking out at the ballroom of female Democrats, Clinton asked if they were hopeful of seeing more women running for local offices like school board member, governor, mayor and member of Congress. \"I suppose it's only fair to say, 'Don't you someday want to see a woman president?'\" she asked, generating loud applause.</p>", "<p>It was unclear whom Clinton hired to set up or maintain her private email server, which the AP traced to a mysterious identity, Eric Hoteham. That name does not appear in public records databases, campaign contribution records or Internet background searches. Hoteham was listed as the customer at Clinton's $1.7 million home on Old House Lane in Chappaqua in records registering the Internet address for her email server since August 2010.</p>", "<p>The Hoteham personality also is associated with a separate email server, presidentclinton.com, and a non-functioning website, wjcoffice.com, all linked to the same residential Internet account as Mrs. Clinton's email server. The former president's full name is William Jefferson Clinton.</p>", "<p>In November 2012, without explanation, Clinton's private email account was reconfigured to use Google's servers as a backup in case her own personal email server failed, according to Internet records. That is significant because Clinton publicly supported <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/china-google-hackers-goal-spying-on-us-govt/\">Google's accusations</a> in June 2011 that China's government had tried to break into the Google mail accounts of senior U.S. government officials. It was one of the first instances of a major American corporation openly accusing a foreign government of hacking.</p>", "<p>Then, in July 2013, five months after she resigned as secretary of state, Clinton's private email server was reconfigured again to use a Denver-based commercial email provider, MX Logic, which is now owned by McAfee Inc., a top Internet security company.</p>", "<p>The New York Times reported Monday that Clinton exclusively used a personal email account it did not specify to conduct State Department business. The disclosure raised questions about whether she took actions to preserve copies of her old work-related emails, as required by the Federal Records Act. A Clinton spokesman, Nick Merrill, told the newspaper that Clinton <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/hillary-clintons-team-defends-her-email-usage-at-state/\">complied with the letter and spirit of the law</a> because her advisers reviewed tens of thousands of pages of her personal emails to decide which ones to turn over to the State Department after the agency asked for them.</p>", "<p>In theory but not in practice, Clinton's official emails would be accessible to anyone who requested copies under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act. Under the law, citizens and foreigners can compel the government to turn over copies of federal records for zero or little cost. Since Clinton effectively retained control over emails in her private account even after she resigned in 2013, the government would have to negotiate with Clinton to turn over messages it can't already retrieve from the inboxes of federal employees she emailed.  </p>", "<p>The AP has waited more than a year under the open records law for the State Department to turn over some emails covering Clinton's tenure as the nation's top diplomat, although the agency has never suggested that it didn't possess all her emails.  </p>", "<p>Clinton's private email account surfaced publicly in March 2013 after a convicted Romanian hacker known as Guccifer published emails stolen from former White House adviser Sidney Blumenthal. The Internet domain was registered around the time of her secretary of state nomination.  </p>", "<p>Rep.

In the <em>Obergefell v. Hodges</em> case, plaintiff Jim Obergefell was specifically seeking the right to be listed on his husband's death certificate. Obergefell and his longtime partner John Arthur were legally married in Maryland in 2013, when Arthur was terminally ill.

While many analysts believe Windows 8 made sagging PC sales even worse, it's unclear if Windows 10 will spur the industry back to growth.</p>", "<p>Here's a look at the launch and why it matters:</p>", "<p><strong>Q: What happens this week?</strong></p>", "<p>A: Microsoft plans promotional events in several cities Wednesday, tied to a global ad campaign and a series of charitable donations. About 5 million people who enrolled in an earlier test program will be able to download Windows 10 right away.</p>", "<p>The company is also offering Windows 10 as a free download, any time over the next year, to anyone who has the Home or Pro versions of Windows 7 or 8 (but not the Enterprise versions used by big organizations). Some people might not get it the first day; Microsoft says it will deliver downloads in waves, to ensure things go smoothly, but it hasn't said how long that will take. Details on how to upgrade are <a href=\"http://bit.ly/1eNCySl\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>", "<p>Retailers such as Best Buy, Staples and Wal-Mart will have some desktops and laptops with Windows 10 already installed. More models are coming.</p>", "<p><strong>Q: Why is Microsoft giving Windows 10 for free?</strong></p>", "<p>A: The company wants to get the new software on as many devices as possible. Microsoft needs a large pool of users to convince independent programmers that it's worth their time to build useful or entertaining apps for Windows 10 devices. Executives also believe that if people are exposed to the latest and best Windows, they're more likely to try other Microsoft products on PCs and mobile devices.</p>", "<p>CEO Satya Nadella says he wants to have 1 billion devices running Windows 10 in three years. Microsoft estimates there are 1.5 billion people who currently use some kind of Windows. Rather than charging them to upgrade, as Microsoft used to do, it's <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-real-reason-microsoft-is-offering-windows-10-for-free/\">embracing the free download model</a> pioneered by Apple and Google.</p>", "<p><strong>Q: How will Microsoft make money?</strong></p>", "<p>A: Microsoft will still collect licensing fees from PC makers that install Windows 10 on new machines. In recent years, most consumers have waited until they bought a new computer to get the latest Windows. Microsoft also makes money from selling Windows and other software to large businesses and organizations.</p>", "<p>In addition, Microsoft is counting on Windows 10 to spur more use of other services. Microsoft makes money from selling advertising for its Bing search engine, and Windows 10 comes with many apps that steer people to Bing. The company also collects fees from people who use premium versions of its Office software, OneDrive cloud storage and Skype.</p>", "<p><strong>Q: Why does this matter to consumers?</strong></p>", "<p>A: Microsoft says Windows 10 is designed for the way people use computers today - with a faster Web browser and features that make it easier to start tasks on a PC and then switch to a hand-held device. (Apple and Google tout similar features in their software.)</p>", "<p>Windows 10 also lets users log in with their face, iris or thumbprint, instead of remembering passwords, though this works only with computers equipped with the right hardware.</p>", "<p>Most PC users are still working with Windows 7, thanks to Windows 8's unpopularity. But Microsoft plans to phase out maintenance and security support for Windows 7 over the next five years, and for Windows 8 by 2023, as it did with the older Windows XP. Still, there's no need to panic about upgrading right away.</p>", "<p><strong>Q: Why is it important to the tech industry?</strong></p>", "<p>A: The growth in mobile devices has caused PC sales to decline for more than three years, hurting manufacturers like Hewlett-Packard and companies like Microsoft and Intel, whose products are used with PCs.</p>", "<p>Windows 10 won't make people give up their hand-held gadgets, but it's part of Nadella's strategy to reposition Microsoft for a world where people use multiple devices.

If you currently run Windows 7 or Windows 8 and you pre-ordered your free copy of the new operating system via the promotional icon in the taskbar, then you may very well be able to install it today; if you are a \"Windows Insider\" who installed the Windows 10 beta, you're pretty much guaranteed to be able to get it today.</p>", "<p>If you haven't pre-ordered, you might have to wait a bit. Indeed, in typically Microsoft fashion, the rollout is a bit confusing. Pre-ordered retail boxes will ship today, but if you want to get Windows without a pre-order, you'll be waiting well into August. And then there are Windows 10 computers: It looks like HP and Dell machines are available now, with other vendors following later in the month, leveraging free upgrades to Windows 10 as a way of avoiding the need to have machines Windows 10-ready right out of the gate.</p>", "<p>So much for a seamless, orderly product roll-out. But availability notwithstanding, what are you actually getting?</p>", "<p>For starters, a Start menu. If you know anything at all about Windows 10, you probably know that Windows 10 restores the start menu that Windows 8 took away -- but it's a modernized start menu that incorporates aspects of the horizontally-sliding Start Screen, complete with Live Tiles. It's not exactly like the old Windows 7 start menu, but then again, the start menu has evolved significantly with almost every version of Windows.</p>", "<p>After the start menu, the thing you're most like to notice about Windows 10 is virtual desktops. While cynics will complain that Microsoft has rolled out the ability to switch among multiple desktops, each with its own set of programs, is about 15 years too late, people who tend to run a lot of programs and get lost in a sea of open windows may appreciate the ability to better organize their workspace.</p>", "<p>And then there's Cortana. Microsoft's answer to the iPhone's Siri, Cortana is a natural language voice search tool built into the start menu. Cortana can launch programs, conduct web searches, and serve as a sort of personal assistant thanks to her ability to understand your schedule and other personal details.</p>", "<p>The last of the obvious improvements: Microsoft has also matured the modern apps -- the full-screen, menuless apps that lived in their own environment that was once called Metro -- by letting them run on the desktop. They now have all the usual interface elements of any Windows app.</p>", "<p>But there's a lot more under the hood. There's a brand new web browser called Edge, for example, which replaces the much maligned Internet Explorer. It's fast and streamlined, but obviously not nearly as mature as competitors like Firefox or Chrome. There's also something called Windows Hello, a biometric tool that can log you in using face recognition. Few folks will get to experience this right away, though, as it requires a special depth-sensing webcam which is still relatively rare. There's also Continuum, a feature that lets you switch seamlessly from touch to keyboard depending upon how you configure your tablet or hybrid laptop. And if you've ever been annoyed -- or infuriated -- by the way Windows restarts your PC on its schedule, not yours, you'll appreciate the fact that you can schedule those restarts now.</p>", "<p>Should you upgrade? Almost certainly. Windows 10 appears to be a dramatic improvement over most versions of Windows -- XP, Vista, and Windows 8 especially. And for Windows 7 and Windows 8 users, the upgrade is free. That's the best Windows deal Microsoft has ever offered.</p>", "<p><em>Photo courtesy <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft</a></em></p>"], "article_author": ["Dave Johnson"]}

More than 130,000 signed a Change.org petition against the experiment.</p>", "<p>Even potential boosters say those responsible must do more to show that benefits outweigh the risks.</p>", "<p>\"I think the science is fine, they definitely can kill mosquitoes, but the GMO issue still sticks as something of a thorny issue for the general public,\" said Phil Lounibos, who studies mosquito control at the Florida Medical Entomology Laboratory. \"It's not even so much about the science - you can't go ahead with something like this if public opinion is negative.\"</p>", "<p>Mosquito controllers say they're running out of options that can kill Aedes aegypti, a tiger-striped invader whose biting females spread these viruses. Climate change and globalization are spreading tropical diseases farther from the equator, and Key West, the southernmost U.S. city, is particularly vulnerable.</p>", "<p>\"An arriving person would be infectious for several days, and could infect many of the local mosquitoes,\" Doyle said. \"Within a few weeks you'd likely end up with several infected mosquitoes for each infected visitor.\"</p>", "<p>There are no vaccines or cures for dengue, known as \"break-bone fever,\" or chikungunya, which causes painful contortions. U.S. cases remain rare for now, but dengue sickens 50 million people annually worldwide and kills 2.5 percent of the half-million who get severe cases, according to the World Health Organization. Chikungunya has already overwhelmed hospitals and harmed economies across the Caribbean after infecting a million people in the region last year.</p>", "<p>Insecticides are sprayed year-round from helicopters and door-to-door in charming and crowded neighborhoods throughout the Keys. But because Aedes aegypti don't travel much and are repeatedly doused with the same chemicals, they have evolved to resist four of the six insecticides used to kill them.</p>", "<p>Enter Oxitec, a British biotech firm launched by Oxford University researchers. They patented a method of breeding Aedes aegypti with fragments of proteins from the herpes simplex virus and E. coli bacteria as well as genes from coral and cabbage. This synthetic DNA has been used in thousands of experiments without harming lab animals, but it is fatal to the bugs, killing mosquito larvae before they can fly or bite.</p>", "<p>Oxitec's lab workers manually remove modified females, aiming to release only males, which feed on nectar and don't bite for blood like females do. The modified males then mate with wild females whose offspring die, reducing the population.</p>", "<p>Oxitec has built a breeding lab in Marathon and hopes to release its mosquitoes this spring in Key Haven, a neighborhood of 444 homes closely clustered on a relatively isolated peninsula at the north end of Key West.</p>", "<p>FDA spokeswoman Theresa Eisenman said no field tests will be allowed until the agency has \"thoroughly reviewed all the necessary information.\"</p>", "<p>Company spokeswoman Chris Creese said the test will be similar in size to Oxitec's 2012 experiment in the Cayman Islands, where 3.3 million modified mosquitoes were released over six months, suppressing 96 percent of the targeted bugs. Oxitec says a later test in Brazil also was successful, and both countries now want larger-scale projects.</p>", "<p>But critics accused Oxitec of failing to obtain informed consent in the Caymans, saying residents weren't told they could be bitten by a few stray females overlooked in the lab.</p>", "<p>Instead, Oxitec said only non-biting males would be released, and that even if humans were somehow bitten, no genetically modified DNA would enter their bloodstream.</p>", "<p>Neither claim is entirely true, outside observers say.</p>", "<p>\"What Oxitec is trying to spin is that it's highly improbable that there will be negative consequences of this foreign DNA entering someone that's bitten by an Oxitec mosquito,\" said Lounibos. \"I'm on their side, in that consequences are highly unlikely. But to say that there's no genetically modified DNA that might get into a human, that's kind of a gray matter.\"</p>", "<p>Asked about these points, Creese says Oxitec has now released 70 million of its mosquitoes in several countries and received no reports of human impacts caused by bites or from the synthetic DNA, despite regulatory oversight that encourages people to report any problems. \"We are confident of the safety of our mosquito, as there's no mechanism for any adverse effect on human health. The proteins are non-toxic and non-allergenic,\" she said.</p>", "<p>Oxitec should still do more to show that the synthetic DNA causes no harm when transferred into humans by its mosquitoes, said Guy Reeves, a molecular geneticist at Germany's Max Planck Institute. To build trust in any cutting-edge science, a range of independent experts - not just the company that stands to gain or the regulatory agency involved - should have enough access to data published in peer-reviewed journals to be able to explain the specific benefits and risks, he said.</p>", "<p>\"Failing to do this almost inevitably means a potential for controversy to be sustained and amplified,\" said Reeves, adding that mosquito-borne diseases need more solutions. \"We should not be closing down productive avenues, and genetically modified mosquitoes might be one of them.\"</p>", "<p>With the FDA watching, Doyle and Oxitec's product development manager, Derric Nimmo, checked their frustration at public meetings in November and December, repeatedly fielding the same questions from the same critics.</p>", "<p>Their selling points:</p>", "<p>This experiment is self-limiting, using insects engineered to kill their progeny, not make them stronger. It is contained, since Oxitec's mosquitoes won't breed with other species. Killing off Aedes aegypti can protect human health while eliminating an invasive species. And most Key Haven residents responded positively to a district survey about the planned field test.</p>", "<p>Using GMOs also could save money: The district spends 10 percent of its budget on Aedes aegypti, which represents less than 1 percent of the 45 mosquito species buzzing around the Keys.</p>", "<p>Key Haven resident Marilyn Smith still wasn't persuaded. The Keys haven't experienced a dengue outbreak in years, and no chikungunya cases have been reported here, she said.</p>", "<p>\"If I knew that this was a real risk and lives could be saved, that would make sense,\" Smith said. \"But there are no problems. Why are we trying to fix it? Why are we being used as the experiment, the guinea pigs, just to see what happens?\"</p>", "<p>If the FDA decides against the test, or the modified mosquitoes fail to work as promised, Doyle will still need to kill the bugs.</p>", "<p>\"I'm convinced the only way to fight this is using the mosquitoes to fight each other,\" he said.</p>"], "article_author": ["January 25, 2015, 2:32 PM"]}

It found that drinking up to seven alcoholic beverages per week could reduce the risk for heart failure by 20 percent for men and 16 percent for women.</p>", "<p>\"These findings suggest that drinking alcohol in moderation does not contribute to an increased risk of heart failure and may even be protective,\" Dr. Scott Solomon, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and senior physician at Brigham and Women's Hospital, said in a press release. However, he added, \"heavy alcohol use is certainly a risk factor for deaths from any cause.\"</p>", "<p>The study participants, all between the ages of 45 and 64 years old, were divided into six categories: people who drank up to seven alcoholic beverages a week; those who had between 7 and 14 a week; between 14 and 21 drinks per week; more than 21; as well as former drinkers and abstainers. A single drink was defined as 14 grams of alcohol, which is equivalent to approximately half a pint of beer, a small glass of wine or a single shot of hard liquor such as whiskey or vodka.</p>", "<p>The researchers followed the study participants from the late 1980s until the end of 2011, by which time 1,271 men and 1,237 women had developed heart failure.

The study also found that the <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/study-men-who-drink-two-beers-a-day-less-likely-to-die-after-a-heart-attack/\">protective benefits of alcohol</a> were slightly stronger for men than for women. </p>", "<p>\"There are a number of different mechanisms by which the effects of alcohol on the heart may differ by sex,\" write the researchers in their study. \"Women have a higher proportion of body fat and absorb and metabolize alcohol differently than men, attaining higher blood alcohol concentrations for a given amount of alcohol consumed.\"</p>", "<p>When it comes to alcohol and health, more is not better. The study found that heavier alcohol consumption -- 14 or more drinks per week -- did not appear to offer a protective benefit, regardless of gender. When the researchers looked at data on all causes of death, the heaviest drinkers had the highest increased risk for mortality from any cause: 47 percent for men and 89 percent for women who consumed 21 or more drinks a week.</p>", "<p>The study also found the highest rate of heart failure was among former drinkers. \"This could be related to the reasons why they had stopped drinking in the first place, for instance because they had already developed health problems that might have made them more likely to go on to develop heart failure,\" Solomon said.</p>"], "article_author": ["Jessica Firger"]}

David Paterson sought a penny-an-ounce \"fat tax\" on soda and other sugary drinks. After a multi-million-dollar campaign by the beverage industry claiming the tax would cost jobs, the state legislature turned down what would have amounted to a 12-cent tax on a can of Coke. But, in an ironic twist, they agreed to add another $1.60 in taxes to the cost of a pack of cigarettes.</p>", "<p>A few years later, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg tried a different approach by banning the sale of sugary drinks larger than 16 ounces at restaurants, delis and other outlets. The <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/bloomberg-confident-soda-ban-will-be-upheld/\">ban was thrown out by the courts</a> without ever taking effect.</p>", "<p>Now, the <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/taxing-sugary-sodas-could-help-fight-childhood-obesity/\">soda tax idea</a> may be getting a second wind. Last week, voters in Berkeley, California, passed the nation's first soda tax, a penny an ounce, in order to curb the consumption of sugary drinks. However, across the bay in San Francisco, voters rejected a proposed 2-cents an ounce soda tax.</p>", "<p>Passing this type of legislation takes time, effort, and money. Is it really worth it?</p>", "<p>Camara, the author of the warning-label bill, thinks so. \"The people that are disproportionately affected by diabetes are poor or people of color, and I believe increasing awareness will help parents stop giving soda to their children,\" he says.</p>", "<p>More than <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-obesity-rates-fall-for-young-kids-but-overall-rates-remain-stagnant/\">one third of American adults and 17 percent of children are obese</a>, according to data from the CDC.

Republicans were fiercely critical of how the Obama administration addressed the violence from nearly the moment the attacks became public, and a handful of GOP senators has continued to make the issue a sticking point in the days since.</p>", "<p>Much of the political controversy has surrounded the administration's characterization of the attacks in their immediate aftermath: In early comments, White House officials -- including press secretary Jay Carney and U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice -- suggested the violence might have been the result of spontaneous protests spurred by an anti-Muslim video. Those comments, which ultimately proved untrue, were guided by a set of unclassified talking points given to Rice ahead of her television appearances. Those talking points, however, were edited to cut specific references to \"al Qaeda\" and \"terrorism\" ahead of Rice's Sept. 16 television appearances.</p>", "<p>Republicans pounced on the discrepancies between Rice's comments and others, and the ambassador ultimately clarified that there had been \"no protest or demonstration in Benghazi\" and that \"the intelligence assessment [had] evolved\" since her Sept. 16 comments. Still, the administration attempted to smooth over the criticism in a series of closed-door meetings with members of Congress. In November, acting CIA Director Mike Morrell and Rice met privately with Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., John McCain, R-Ariz., and Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., specifically to address their questions about the Benghazi attacks. In that meeting, Morrell said he believed it was the FBI that removed the references, despite previous accounts stating the edits had been the work of the CIA. Morrell later retracted that statement, saying he \"misspoke\" and that the CIA was, in fact, responsible; meanwhile, the senators continued to rail against the White House for its inconsistencies.</p>", "<p>While Rice has borne the political consequences of the controversy -- she had been among the top contenders to replace Clinton as secretary of state but withdrew from consideration in December due to the protracted criticism -- Clinton has so far avoided much of the fallout. She publicly accepted responsibility for both the attacks and the internal failings that led to them, and was quick to begin implementing a series of outside recommendations for ensuring that similar incidents aren't repeated going forward. Today's hearings, however, will test her abilities to stay above the fray of criticism.</p>", "<p>According to State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland, Clinton will, during the hearing, answer \"any remaining questions\" lawmakers have on the Benghazi attacks, and outline the operational reforms she's put in motion for her expected successor, Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., whose confirmation hearings are scheduled for tomorrow.</p>", "<p>\"[B]oth on the Senate side, and on the House side, members of Congress will have a chance to hear what the secretary has to say, but also to ask her any remaining questions that they have on this matter,\" Nuland told reporters Tuesday. \"She will focus, not only on [an outside Accountability Review Board (ARB) report on what went wrong in Benghazi], but on all the work that the department has done already to implement the ARB report, and give a status on that, and an update on the work that -- that remains.\"  </p>", "<p>Much of that ground was covered last month, in a similar hearing with State Department Deputy Secretary of State William Burns and Deputy Secretary of State Thomas Nides. Clinton had originally been slated to appear at that hearing, but canceled after suffering from both the flu, a concussion, and ultimately, a blood clot that landed her in the hospital.</p>"], "article_author": ["Lucy Madison"]}

Bernie Sanders as being at odds with <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/obama-announces-initiatives-to-improve-gun-safety/\">President Barack Obama on gun control</a> after the president denounced legislation protecting gun-makers from lawsuits.</p>", "<p>Clinton's campaign chairman, former Obama adviser John Podesta, called on Sanders to join Obama and Clinton by taking on the issue of liability for gun manufacturers whose firearms are used in a crime. And Clinton herself called in to a cable news show to challenge Sanders to change his tune.</p>", "<p>\"Maybe it's time for Sen. Sanders to stand up and say, 'I got this one wrong,'\" Clinton told MSNBC's \"Hardball\" on Friday. \"When it really mattered, Sen. Sanders voted with the gun lobby, and I voted against the gun lobby.\"</p>", "<p>Sanders aides said there was \"zero daylight\" between Obama and Sanders and have argued that he was re-evaluating his position on the gun manufacturer liability law he voted for in 2005.</p>", "<p>Clinton has spent months <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/democratic-debate-where-the-candidates-fall-on-gun-control/\">going after Sanders' record</a> on gun control. A fresh opening came with the op-ed penned by Obama in Friday's New York Times in which he referred to the \"virtual immunity from lawsuits\" that he said gun manufacturers enjoy.</p>", "<p>\"I will not campaign for, vote for or support any candidate, even in my own party, who does not support common-sense gun reform,\" Obama wrote.</p>", "<p>White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Obama had intentionally raised the issue of liability for gun manufacturers, adding that if Sanders became the Democratic nominee, the White House would have to examine his record to determine whether Obama can support him.</p>", "<p>Earnest said Obama hadn't intended to send any \"secret or subtle signal\" about his preferred candidate in the Democratic primary. And he pointed out that Sanders had recently said he was open to reconsidering his opposition to liability legislation, perhaps in response to Obama's executive actions.</p>", "<p>\"That's exactly the goal here, right?\" Earnest told reporters at the White House. \"We want people to change their minds. We want members of Congress to start taking different positions.\"</p>", "<p>In Iowa, Sanders criticized the former secretary of state over a proposal to provide workers with three months of paid family and medical leave. The senator supports Senate legislation that would pay for the more generous benefits by raising the payroll tax on a typical worker by $1.61 per week.</p>", "<p>Clinton supports providing three months of paid leave but opposes the Senate bill because she has said she won't raise taxes on families earning $250,000 a year or less. Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver said the gun dispute was an effort to turn the focus away from other issues.</p>", "<p>\"The conversation that they don't want to have is about why Secretary Clinton doesn't support the family medical leave bill, her record on Wall Street and a host of other issues,\" Weaver said.</p>", "<p>The attacks, coming less than a month before the first round of primary voting, mark an effort by the Clinton team to cast their candidate as the natural heir to Obama, who remains a beloved figure among Democratic primary voters. Obama has sought to avoid showing favoritism in the Democratic primary, in which Clinton and Sanders have both portrayed themselves as the best protector of Obama's legacy.</p>", "<p>While Sanders has wooed the Democratic base with his liberal positions, he's had to defend a <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/media/where-the-2016-candidates-stand-on-gun-control/5/\">more mixed record on gun legislation</a> - a reflection, he says, of his rural, gun-friendly home state.</p>", "<p>After the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Connecticut, Sanders backed all the Democratic gun bills brought up in Congress. But in 1993, he voted against the landmark Brady handgun bill, which imposed a five-day waiting period for gun purchases.</p>", "<p>Sanders now says he supports banning assault weapons and closing the so-called gun show loophole that exempts private, unlicensed gun sales from background check requirements.</p>"], "article_author": ["January 9, 2016, 9:32 AM"]}

Yahoo's stock has sunk by 35 percent so far this year as investors' frustration with the follies have mounted, spurring calls for her replacement.</p>", "<p>\"This is like an 'emperor has no clothes' situation,\" says Eric Jackson, a Yahoo shareholder and managing director of the New York hedge fund Ader Investment Management. \"The company and the shareholders would be better served with her leaving.\"</p>", "<p>Jackson, though perhaps Mayer's most outspoken critic, isn't alone.</p>", "<p>After conferring with investors, SunTrust analyst Robert Peck recently wrote a letter to Yahoo's board recommending that the directors consider firing Mayer. Activist investor Jeffrey Smith of hedge fund Starboard Value is urging Mayer to abandon a spin-off of the Yahoo's most valuable asset -- a $30 billion stake in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group -- and sell the company's Internet business instead.</p>", "<p>If Mayer continues down her current course, Smith is threatening to lead a shareholder mutiny aimed at overthrowing Yahoo's board next year -- a rebellion that, if successful, could lead to her ouster.</p>", "<p>Yahoo's own employees seem dispirited as well. Mayer's approval rating among those who posted on the employer-review website Glassdoor.com has fallen to 73 percent from 99 percent after her July 2012 hiring.</p>", "<p>At least a dozen members of Yahoo's management team have left in the past year. The departures have included two of Mayer's top lieutenants, former marketing and media chief Kathy Savitt and former development and acquisitions chief Jacqueline Reses.</p>", "<p>Yahoo Inc. declined to comment for this article.</p>", "<p>Mayer has repeatedly expressed confidence that Yahoo is heading in the right direction, most recently during her October review of the company's disappointing quarterly performance. \"I have very aggressive expectations for Yahoo's core business,\" she said. \"We have the right talent, the right strategy, and the right assets to drive long-term sustainable growth for our investors.\"</p>", "<p>Yahoo's revenue fell 8 percent from the previous year after subtracting the company's advertising commissions, its steepest decline since Mayer became CEO. It's likely to fare even worse in the October-December quarter, given that that company expects net revenue to drop by about 20 percent.</p>", "<p>Now Mayer is drawing up plans for another major shake-up, one likely to eliminate hundreds of jobs as Yahoo sharpens its focus on \"fewer products with higher quality,\" as she said in October. Mayer promised more details in January.</p>", "<p>It wasn't supposed to get this bleak with Mayer at the helm. She came to Yahoo as a widely respected technology executive who had helped build Google into the Internet's most powerful company while repeatedly outmaneuvering Yahoo with products that attracted more traffic and advertising.</p>", "<p>Mayer's arrival was supposed to herald a promising new era after the disheartening downfalls of the four CEOs that preceded her. Those executives -- Terry Semel, Jerry Yang, Carol Bartz and Scott Thompson -- either resigned or were dumped when it became apparent that they couldn't revive the growth that made Yahoo one of the Internet's biggest successes during the dot-com boom of the 1990s.</p>", "<p>Things started well. Mayer bought dozens of startups to bring in more engineering expertise in mobile devices and overhauled Yahoo's apps for weather, sports, Flickr and email. She made big splashes by hiring former NBC News anchor Katie Couric to handle online video reports and acquired the trendy blogging service Tumblr for $1.1 billion.</p>", "<p>The moves haven't really paid off, although Mayer continues to boast about Yahoo's progress in the important mobile and video markets. None of Yahoo's services rank among the top 50 free apps in Apple's store, and the company's expansion into original video programming resulted in a $42 million charge to account for the duds.</p>", "<p>Investors are still awaiting proof that that Tumblr or any other of Mayer's acquisitions will be worth what Yahoo paid.</p>", "<p>\"Across all dimensions, her efforts haven't delivered the results that people might have expected,\" says S&amp;P Capital IQ analyst Scott Kessler.</p>", "<p>At one point in Mayer's tenure, Yahoo's stock had more than tripled from where it stood when she took over. The gains, though, were almost entirely tied to Yahoo's large stake in Alibaba, which it acquired in a $1 billion deal negotiated a decade ago. That holding -- in retrospect, Yahoo's best investment ever -- soared in value as Alibaba's e-commerce bazaar boomed, prompting investors to snap up Yahoo shares in order to profit while Alibaba was still privately held.</p>", "<p>When Alibaba went public last year, Yahoo sold a portion of its holdings and then announced plans to spin off its remaining $30 billion stake into a new holding company to avoid paying taxes on future gains. Now that strategy, too, is under a cloud; the Internal Revenue Service has declined say that the spin-off will qualify for the expected tax exemption.</p>", "<p>Mayer plans to complete the spin-off by January anyway. Starboard's Smith thinks she has that exactly backward; he wants Yahoo to retain the Alibaba stake and sell its websites, mobile applications and advertising services. It's unclear who would buy them, given their malaise.</p>", "<p>Kessler likens Mayer's plight to a star quarterback who signs with a National Football League franchise that's in the doldrums. \"When the quarterback starts out, people get very excited about the potential and opportunities,\" he says. \"But when the performance on the field turns out to be less than stellar, people are understandably going to blame the quarterback that came in with so much fanfare.\"</p>"], "article_author": [" CBSNews"]}

Average consumption for the group was 1.5 drinks a day or less, and those drinkers made up 30 percent of the reported deaths. Larger amounts of alcohol led to higher risks of dying from cancer. Forty-eight to 60 percent of the deaths were attributed to people who drank three or more drinks a day. </p>", "<p>\"When it comes to alcohol consumption and cancers, clearly excessive drinking is the riskiest type of drinking,\" Naimi said to <a href=\"http://boston.cbslocal.com/2013/02/14/study-alcohol-is-leading-preventable-cause-of-cancer-in-u-s/\">CBS station WBZ in Boston</a>. \"But when it comes to cancer, there is no safe level of alcohol consumption.\"</p>", "<p>In addition to figuring out how many cancer deaths were related to alcohol, researchers also determined that breast cancer was the most common type of drinking-related deaths in women. This form of cancer alone made up 15 percent of the alcohol-related deaths, amounting to 6,000 women annually. </p>", "<p>For men, mouth, throat and esophageal cancers were the most common alcohol-associated deaths, making up about 6,000 deaths annually.</p>", "<p>Naimi recommended to <a href=\"http://m.prevention.com/health/health-concerns/alcohol-shown-significantly-increase-cancer-risk\">Prevention</a> that people not start drinking, and if they do they should definitely cut down \"plain and simple.\" </p>", "<p>\"The purpose of this study is not to stigmatize moderate drinking, and I apologize if this makes people feel bummed out,\" Naimi said to Prevention. \"But it is important for people to know that yes, alcohol is a carcinogen, and it does increase your risk.

What you can do is use a mathematical data, like a string of numbers and letters,\" principle security researcher at security firm Lookout Marc Rogers, who has not yet used the iPhone 5S, told CBSNews.com. </p>", "<p>Rogers says that to gain valuable information, a hacker would have to figure out what formula Apple is using to encrypt the data.

In 2002, a Japanese cryptographer Tsutomu Matsumoto <a href=\"http://www.theregister.co.uk/2002/05/16/gummi_bears_defeat_fingerprint_sensors/\">used gelatin and a plastic mold to fake a fingerprint</a>. \n\n</p>", "<p>It's not clear yet how sensitive the iPhone 5S' sensor will be, but Apple has added other security features.

This feature is mainly useful when you want to let people glance through your entire collection of photos. That could be when you're sitting with a friend in the same room or making a presentation before a large audience. You can hide embarrassing or incriminating photos - such as naked <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/kim-kardashian-to-publish-selfie-book/\">selfies</a> - as long as you remain in control of the device.

With photos, for instance, just go to the Gallery app and select the photos or albums you want to keep private. Then hit the menu icon for the option to \"Move to Private.\" This also works with selected video, music, audio recordings.</p>", "<p>After you've marked your files as private, you need to go back to the settings to turn Private Mode off. Think of that setting as the door to a vault. Turning it on opens the door and lets you move stuff in and out. Turning it off closes and locks the door. It's the opposite of what you might think: Private Mode needs to be off for your content to be secure.</p>", "<p>Once locked, it is as though the content never existed. No one will know what's inside the vault, or whether there's even anything inside.

You then specify which apps your guest can access. For instance, you might want to give access to the phone, alarm clock and music, but you might want to block email and texts.</p>", "<p>In some cases, guests have limited access to your content. With the Gallery app, your collection of photos won't generally appear unless they are in the \"Guest album.\" Guests can take photos, too, and have them appear there. On the other hand, if you enable access to the Photos app, your guest gets everything. Likewise, there are no restrictions with email or texts if you allow access to those apps.</p>", "<p>Log in as a guest - with the alternative code - to verify what's available after you pick the apps to allow.</p>", "<p>Beyond the guest mode, the G3 lets you lock certain images in the Gallery app during normal use, similar to what the Galaxy devices offer.</p>", "<p><strong>- THE BIGGER PICTURE:</strong></p>", "<p>These tips touch only the surface of what you can do to protect your privacy.</p>", "<p>For instance, these apply only to data stored on the device.

It portrays that we are clinging to kind of failed policies and failed practices in the past.</p>", "<p> \tScott Pelley: Are you saying that the way we have waged the war on drugs for more than 40 years has been all wrong?</p>", "<p> \tMichael Botticelli: It has been all wrong.</p>", "<p> \tBlunt force didn't knock out the drug epidemic. 21 million Americans are addicted to drugs or alcohol. And half of all federal inmates are in for drug crimes.</p>", "<p> \tMichael Botticelli: We can't arrest and incarcerate addiction out of people. Not only do I think it's really inhumane, but it's ineffective and it cost us billions upon billions of dollars to keep doing this.</p>", "<p> \tScott Pelley: So what have we learned?</p>", "<p> \tMichael Botticelli: We've learned addiction is a brain disease. This is not a moral failing. This is not about bad people who are choosing to continue to use drugs because they lack willpower. You know, we don't expect people with cancer just to stop having cancer.</p>", "<p> \tScott Pelley: Aren't they doing it to themselves? Isn't a heroin addict making that choice?</p>", "<p> \tMichael Botticelli: Of course not. You know, the hallmark of addiction is that it changes your brain chemistry. It actually affects that part of your brain that's responsible for judgment.</p>", "<p> \tThat is the essence of Michael Botticelli's approach -- addicts should be patients, not prisoners. He did it in Massachusetts as Director of Substance Abuse Services. There, his initiatives included a high school for teens in recovery and expanding drug courts, like this one in Washington D.C., where offenders can choose treatment over jail. And the charges can be dropped.</p>", "<p> \tScott Pelley: You know that there are people watching this interview and they're saying to themselves, \"Oh, great. He wants to open the jails and let the drug addicts out.\"</p>", "<p> \tScott Pelley: I think we have to base our policy on scientific understanding. You know, and we've had really great models and evaluated models to show that we can simultaneously divert people away from our criminal justice system without an increase in crime. And it actually reduces crime.</p>", "<p> \tBotticelli pursues reform with the passion of the converted because he, himself, is recovering from addiction. Back in 1988, he was a university administrator, whose car slammed into a truck. Botticelli was drunk, in truth, he'd been drunk for years.</p>", "<p> \tScott Pelley: Did you love drinking?</p>", "<p> \tMichael Botticelli: I would say that I probably had an unhealthy love affair with drinking. You know, I grew up as this kind of insecure kid, you know, kind of making my way. And, you know, drinking took all of that away, you know? People drink and do drugs for a reason. 'Cause it makes them feel good, you know -- until it doesn't anymore.</p>", "<p> \tScott Pelley: Is it true that after the accident you woke up handcuffed to a gurney?</p>", "<p> \tMichael Botticelli: I did. I did. And, you know, you think to yourself, \"how did I get to this point, you know, in my life?\"</p>", "<p> \tThat point included imminent eviction from his apartment because the booze had washed away all the money.</p>", "<p> \tMichael Botticelli: A very wise judge said to me, \"Michael, you have two options. You can either get care for your drinking problem. Or we can continue with criminal proceedings.\"</p>", "<p> \tScott Pelley: It was at that point that you walked into this church and went to the 12-step meeting down in the basement?</p>", "<p> \tMichael Botticelli: Yeah, I did.</p>", "<p> \tScott Pelley: What was that first meeting like?</p>", "<p> \tMichael Botticelli: It's hard for me to talk about this. And not from a sense of sadness. From a sense of tremendous gratitude. This was the first time that I raised my hand and said that I was an alcoholic and that I had a problem. And what the miraculous thing about that movement is that people rally around you in ways, you know, addiction is such an isolating incident in your life. You feel alone. And, you know, when you admit, when you come into a fellowship like this and people just surround you and say, \"We will help you, that you're not alone, that we've been through it before, and you will get through it,\" just gives you such great hope.</p>", "<p> \t<figure class=\"image pull-left image-medium \"><span class=\"img \"><img src=\"http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/12/12/3ef35a8a-0566-46ac-b4f9-7377bc440034/thumbnail/270x150/461a7f7e6f6b941f34693c77b036501e/botticelli-32.jpg\" alt=\"botticelli-32.jpg\" height=\"150\" width=\"270\"></span><figcaption><div class=\"caption\">Michael Botticelli</div></figcaption></figure></p>", "<p> \t\tHe's been alcohol free for 27 years.

And they would not be arrested for having drugs on the premises.</p>", "<p> \tPatrick Glynn: Correct.</p>", "<p> \tScott Pelley: What difference did that make?</p>", "<p> \tPatrick Glynn: That opened the floodgates of people calling 911.</p>", "<p> \tToday, 32 states have a similar 911 law and Naloxone is carried by more than 800 police departments.</p>", "<p> \tIn Massachusetts, Botticelli helped make treating addiction routine healthcare.

We'll figure out the path you can walk down to stay in recovery.]</p>", "<p> \tAnd today, the Affordable Care Act requires most insurance companies to cover addiction treatment.</p>", "<p> \tMichael Botticelli: I often say that substance use is one of the last diseases where we'd let people reach their most acute phase of this disorder before we offer them intervention. You've heard the phrase \"hitting bottom.\" Well, we don't say that with any other disorder. So the medical community has a key role to play in terms of doing a better job of identifying people in the early stages of their disease, in doing a better job at treating people who have this disorder.</p>", "<p> \tNotice that word: \"disorder,\" Botticelli prefers it to \"addiction.\" He wants to lift the stigma by changing the language as he did this past October in a rally on the National Mall.</p>", "<p> \t[Michael Botticelli at rally: We must choose to come out in the light and be treated with dignity and respect.

Botticelli does not believe in adding another drug to that cocktail with the legalization of marijuana.</p>", "<p> \tScott Pelley: You're not a fan?</p>", "<p> \tMichael Botticelli: I'm not a fan. What we've seen quite honestly is a dramatic decrease in the perception of risk among youth around occasional marijuana use. And they are getting the message that because it's legal, that it is, there's no harm associated with it. So, we know that about one in nine people who use marijuana become addicted to marijuana. It's been associated with poor academic performance, in exacerbating mental health conditions linked to lower IQ.</p>", "<p> \tBotticelli worries the marijuana industry is quickly adapting \"big tobacco's\" playbook.</p>", "<p> \tIn the 90s tobacco companies appealed to kids with flavored cigarettes and Joe Camel. Today, the nearly $3 billion marijuana industry promotes sweetened edibles and \"buddie,\" a mascot for legalization.</p>", "<p> \tScott Pelley: You are never gonna be able to talk all the states out of the tax revenue that will come from a burgeoning marijuana industry. It will just be too seductive.</p>", "<p> \tMichael Boticelli: You know, that's quite honestly my fear. Is that states are going to become dependent on the revenue.</p>", "<p> \tScott Pelley: It becomes a co-dependency?</p>", "<p> \tMichael Botticelli: It becomes an addiction to, unfortunately, a tax revenue that's often based on bad public health policy.</p>", "<p> \tAs for his own recovery, Botticelli says it gets easier. Though he still attends those 12-step meetings that he called 'miraculous.'</p>", "<p> \tScott Pelley: There are people watching this interview right now who are addicted to drugs, are alcoholics. And they cannot stop. And to them, you say what?</p>", "<p> \tMichael Botticelli: That there's help. That there's hope. That there is treatment available. If I, in some small way can help people to see that there is this huge, incredible life on the other side of addiction, you know, I will feel accomplished in my job.</p>"], "article_author": []}

Following Steve Jobs was one of the most challenging successions imaginable, a daunting responsibility for the man he handpicked --- Tim Cook.</p>", "<p> \t \t \tTim Cook: I've never met anyone on the face of the earth like him before.

He was a founder like no other: a volatile visionary capable of creating products people wanted before they even knew it. Cook is a measured and passionate engineer from Alabama. On the Apple campus, employees still talk about Steve Jobs in the same way that Tim Cook does.</p>", "<p> \t \t \tTim Cook: It's a bar of excellence that merely good isn't good enough. It has to be great. As Steve used to say, \"Insanely great.\"</p>", "<p> \t \t \tCharlie Rose: You believe you can do things other companies can't do.</p>", "<p> \t \t \tTim Cook: You do. You do.

If you are in this room you are one of the most important people at Apple. They wouldn't let us attend the meeting, but they were eager to tell us what they like so much about their company. That's Jeff Williams, officially named the new chief operating officer this week. That's Eddy Cue. He is the guy who helped create iTunes.</p>", "<p> \t \t \tEddy Cue: It's amazing to be able to work in a place where you're building products that everybody in the world uses.

Meaning if I could see what's underneath it, I would know where the future is of Apple?</p>", "<p> \t \t \tJony Ive: You'd know what we're working on next. And so that's one of the reasons that, that, that it's extraordinarily rare that people come into the design studio.</p>", "<p> \t \t \tCharlie Rose: And that's why you don't like people in this room, period.</p>", "<p> \t \t \tJony Ive: That's right. We don't like people in this room, period.</p>", "<p> \t \t \tIve's team of 22 designers are a very close group --- in 15 years only two have left the company.</p>", "<p> \t \t \t We noticed that Ive's studio is quiet and looks a lot like an Apple store. No coincidence, Ive designed both around his signature wooden tables. Here, Ive and his team create prototypes of future products before the specifications are sent overseas to be manufactured. With the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, the design team made 10 different-sized models before deciding which worked best.</p>", "<p> \t \t \tJony Ive: And we chose these two because partly they just felt right, they somehow, not from a tactile point of view. But just emotionally they felt like a good size.</p>", "<p> \t \t \tCharlie Rose: Do you do this about every product, this amount of dedication to emotional context?</p>", "<p> \t \t \tJony Ive: This is the tip of the iceberg. Because we've found that different textures considerably impact your perception of the object, of the product, what it's like to hold, and what it's like to feel. So the only way that we know how to resolve, and address, and develop all of those issues is to make models is to make prototypes.</p>", "<p> \t \t \tIve also showed us how he prototyped the Apple Watch. It begins with a sketch of the watch casing. Then a computer-aided-design specialist transforms the sketch into a 3-dimensional electronic blueprint. That is sent to this high-precision milling device known as a CNC machine.</p>", "<p> \t \t \tJony Ive: We attach to this fixture in there a block of aluminum. And the cutter that you can see there in this CNC machine is now machining incredibly accurately-- the form-- at the back of the watch--</p>", "<p> \t \t \tCharlie Rose: And creating the round edges.</p>", "<p> \t \t \tJony Ive: Yeah. And all of the tiniest details as well.</p>", "<p> \t \t \tOnce it's been carved, the prototype of the watch casing is sanded and polished by hand by veteran craftsmen. Ive's team oversees every design detail, including testing hundreds of different hues and shades of red, blue, and yellow for the watch bands.</p>", "<p> \t \t \tJony Ive: All of these things I think in aggregate, if we manage to get them right, you sort of sense that it's an authentic, really thoughtfully conceived object.</p>", "<p> \t \t \tIve described the process that comes next --- turning a prototype into a working product requires a high level of complex engineering. When he wanted to make the new Macbook Apple's thinnest and lightest laptop ever, Ive worked with Apple's head of hardware engineering Dan Riccio to create a battery powerful enough to last all day but also small enough to fit into Ive's slim case design.</p>", "<p> \t \t \tDan Riccio: Every tenth of a millimeter in our products is sacred.</p>", "<p> \t \t \tCharlie Rose: Every tenth of a millimeter is sacred--</p>", "<p> \t \t \tDan Riccio: With this design, it involved, you know, mechanical designers, toolmakers chemists, and it also involved software engineers to go off and design a pack that would fit within the surfaces with-- of the product, but still work reliably.</p>", "<p> \t \t \tOne of the most complex engineering challenges at Apple involves the iPhone camera, the most used feature of any Apple product. That's the entire camera you're looking at in my hand.</p>", "<p> \t</p>", "<p> \t \tCharlie Rose: How many parts are in here?</p>", "<p> \t \t \tGraham Townsend: There's over 200 separate individual parts in this-- in that one module there.</p>", "<p> \t \t \tGraham Townsend is in charge of a team of 800 engineers and other specialists dedicated solely to the camera. He showed us a micro suspension system that steadies the camera when your hand shakes.</p>", "<p> \t \t \tGraham Townsend: This whole sus-- autofocus motor here is suspended on four wires. And you'll see them coming in. And here we are. Four-- These are 40-micron wires, less than half a human hair's width. And that holds that whole suspension and moves it in X and Y. So that allows us to stabilize for the hand shake.</p>", "<p> \t \t \tIn the camera lab, engineers calibrate the camera to perform in any type of lighting.</p>", "<p> \t \t \tGraham Townsend: Go to bright bright noon. And there you go. Sunset now. There you go. So, there's very different types of quality of lighting, from a morning, bright sunshine, for instance, the noonday light. And then finally maybe--</p>", "<p> \t \t \tCharlie Rose: Sunset, dinner--</p>", "<p> \t \t \tGraham Townsend: We can simulate all those here.

People are used to living on their phone. So they're used to being dynamic, emotive, immersive. And so how do we make sure when they walk into a store they say, \"Wow\"?</p>", "<p> \t \t \tApple's huge profit margins --- roughly 40 percent across the board --- have made it the most valuable company in the world, worth about $600 billion. People may love their Apple products, but if there is one complaint you hear a lot, it's that by the time you buy one, a newer, better version is already on the way. Apple's head of marketing Phil Schiller admits that the company often pits one product against another.</p>", "<p> \t \t \tCharlie Rose: Is there danger of one product cannibalizing the other product?</p>", "<p> \t \t \t Phil Schiller: It's not a danger, it's almost by design. You need each of these products to try to fight for their space, their time with you. The iPhone has to become so great that you don't know why you want an iPad. The iPad has to be so great that you don't know why you why you want a notebook. The notebook has to be so great, you don't know why you want a desktop. Each one's job is to compete with the other ones.</p>", "<p> \t \t \tThe first new product to come from Apple since Tim Cook took over as CEO was the Apple Watch.</p>", "<p> \t \t \tThere is intense speculation about everything Apple does, including that the watch may not be the breakout product Apple had hoped. It has been on the market for eight months, but Apple has not released any sales figures.</p>", "<p> \t \t \tCharlie Rose: You think it's a product that needs improvement?</p>", "<p> \t \t \tTim Cook: I think all products are--going to be--</p>", "<p> \t \t \tCharlie Rose: I know that. Of course I know that.</p>", "<p> \t \t \tTim Cook: Yeah. And-- I think the watch is no exception to that, is we're-- we're gonna--continue to fine tune--</p>", "<p> \t \t \tCharlie Rose: So you're disappointed--in some of the things.</p>", "<p> \t \t \tTim Cook: I'm not disappointed in it. It's every par--</p>", "<p> \t \t \tCharlie Rose: But you saw room to improve it?</p>", "<p> \t \t \tTim Cook: Charlie, when we launch a product, we're already working on the next one. And possibly even the next, next one. And so yes, we always see things we can do.</p>", "<p> \t \t \t[Tim Cook: This is the future of television, coming now.]</p>", "<p> \t \t \tAnd then there is Apple TV and suggestions that Apple wants to do much more in the television business... as well as speculation about Apple developing a car. But Tim Cook is keeping that a secret too.</p>", "<p> \t \t \tCharlie Rose: How hard is it to say Apple will be in the car business?</p>", "<p> \t \t \tTim Cook: (Laughs)</p>", "<p> \t \t \tCharlie Rose: But OK, how hard is it to say yes we've done this, we're looking it, we may very well go there, how hard is that?</p>", "<p> \t \t \tTim Cook: One of the great things about Apple is probably have more secrecy here than the CIA.</p>", "<p> \t \t \tWhatever secret products Apple may be working on, no one feels the pressure to deliver more than Jony Ive.</p>", "<p> \t \t \tCharlie Rose: Is there any possibility that Apple can get too rich and too fat and too complacent?</p>", "<p> \t \t \tJony Ive: That possibility absolutely exists. I think one of the things that characterizes the way that we work is that our heads tend to be down at these tables worrying about what we're doing. And our heads don't tend to be up, looking around at what we've--</p>", "<p> \t \t \tCharlie Rose: Thinking how great we are, what we achieved?</p>", "<p> \t \t \tJony Ive: Yeah. And we're more aware of the distance between us and the perfection that we're chasing than ever before.</p>", "<p> \t \t \tApple has one million people manufacturing its products in China. Why doesn't it bring those jobs home? That part of the story when we return.</p>", "<p> \t \t \tApple is based in Cupertino, California, but the vast majority of its revenue, workers, and customers are overseas. That raises a number of issues for the world's biggest company. Why won't Apple bring home more manufacturing jobs from China? Why doesn't Apple pay U.S. taxes on the nearly $200 billion it keeps overseas? But perhaps the most pressing issue facing Apple today is encryption. It is believed that the terrorists in last month's attacks in Paris used encrypted apps to avoid surveillance. U.S. law enforcement immediately renewed its calls for Apple and other companies to provide access to its customers' encrypted texts and emails. Apple CEO Tim Cook has refused to do so. And though we interviewed him prior to the attacks, Cook has since told us that Apple is cooperating with authorities to combat terrorism, but he has not changed his position on encryption.</p>", "<p> \t</p>", "<p> \t \t \tCharlie Rose: In the government, they say it's like saying, you know, you have a search warrant, but you can't unlock the trunk.</p>", "<p> \t \t \tTim Cook: Here's the situation is on your smartphone today, on your iPhone, there's likely health information, there's financial information. There are intimate conversations with your family, or your co-workers. There's probably business secrets and you should have the ability to protect it. And the only way we know how to do that, is to encrypt it. Why is that? It's because if there's a way to get in, then somebody will find the way in. There have been people that suggest that we should have a back door. But the reality is if you put a back door in, that back door's for everybody, for good guys and bad guys.</p>", "<p> \t \t \tCharlie Rose: But does the government have a point in which they say, \"If we have good reason to believe in that information is evidence of criminal conduct or national security behavior?\"</p>", "<p> \t \t \tTim Cook: Well if, if the government lays a proper warrant on us today then we will give the specific information that is requested. Because we have to by law. In the case of encrypted communication, we don't have it to give. And so if like your iMessages are encrypted, we don't have access to those.</p>", "<p> \t \t \tCharlie Rose: OK, but help me understand how you get to the government's dilemma.</p>", "<p> \t \t \tTim Cook: I don't believe that the tradeoff here is privacy versus national security.</p>", "<p> \t \t \tCharlie Rose: Versus security.</p>", "<p> \t \t \tTim Cook: I think that's an overly simplistic view. We're America. We should have both.</p>", "<p> \t \t \tNational security isn't the only battle Tim Cook has been fighting with Washington. Apple earns two-thirds of its revenue overseas. Rather than bring it back and pay hefty U.S. taxes, Apple, like many U.S. multinationals, parks billions of dollars in overseas income in subsidiaries in countries like Ireland. The practice is not illegal, but it's at the heart of a battle that has been unfolding in Washington to reform the corporate tax code and bring that money home.</p>", "<p> \t \t \tCharlie Rose: How do you feel when you go before Congress and they say you're a tax avoider?</p>", "<p> \t \t \tTim Cook: What I told them and-- what I'll tell you and-- and the folks watching tonight is we pay more taxes in this country than anyone.</p>", "<p> \t \t \tCharlie Rose: Well, they know that. And you should because of how much money you make.</p>", "<p> \t \t \tTim Cook: Well, I don't deny that. We happily pay it.</p>", "<p> \t \t \tCharlie Rose: But you also have more money overseas, probably, than any other--</p>", "<p> \t \t \tTim Cook: We do.</p>", "<p> \t \t \tCharlie Rose: --American company?</p>", "<p> \t \t \tTim Cook: Because as I said before, two-thirds of our business is over there.</p>", "<p> \t \t \tCharlie Rose: Yeah, but why don't bring that home, is the question?</p>", "<p> \t \t \tTim Cook: I'd love to bring it home.</p>", "<p> \t \t \tCharlie Rose: Why don't you?</p>", "<p> \t \t \tTim Cook: Because it would cost me 40 percent to bring it home. And I don't think that's a reasonable thing to do. This is a tax code, Charlie, that was made for the industrial age, not the digital age. It's backwards. It's awful for America. It should have been fixed many years ago. It's past time to get it done.</p>", "<p> \t \t \tCharlie Rose: But here's what they concluded. Apple is engaged in a sophisticated scheme to pay little or no corporate taxes on $74 billion in revenues held overseas.</p>", "<p> \t \t \tTim Cook: That is total political crap. There is no truth behind it. Apple pays every tax dollar we owe.</p>", "<p> \t \t \tTim Cook has spent much of the last decade expanding Apple's reach around the world, nowhere more than in China.</p>", "<p> \t \t \tIn October, Cook made his ninth trip there since becoming CEO four years ago. In the last year, Apple's sales in china have doubled.</p>", "<p> \t \t \tCharlie Rose: Will there be, at some point in the near future, a bigger market than the United States?</p>", "<p> \t \t \tTim Cook: Yes. I am as certain as I can be of that.</p>", "<p> \t \t \tCharlie Rose: The numbers simply tell you that?</p>", "<p> \t \t \tTim Cook: The numbers tell us-- tell me that. And not just the numbers of people, but the numbers of people moving into the middle class. That, for a consumer company is the thing that really begins to grow the market in a big way.</p>", "<p> \t \t \tAnd most Americans would be surprised to know that nearly all Apple products are manufactured by one million Chinese workers in the factories of Apple contractors, including its largest: Foxconn. Yet Tim Cook insists that China's vast and cheap labor force is not the primary reason for manufacturing there.</p>", "<p> \t<figure class=\"image pull-none image-x-large \"><span class=\"img \"><img src=\"http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/12/21/acae70e5-12d0-4328-a398-a893efcd8ae4/thumbnail/770x430/8c3aae4d76c3e090fdafb88b5e2a7c75/apple17.jpg\" alt=\"apple17.jpg\" height=\"430\" width=\"770\"></span><figcaption><div class=\"caption\">Foxconn</div><div class=\"credit\">\n                                            CBS News\n                                        </div></figcaption></figure>Charlie Rose: So if it's not wages, what is it?</p>", "<p> \t \t \tTim Cook: It's skill.</p>", "<p> \t \t \tCharlie Rose: Skill?</p>", "<p> \t \t \tTim Cook: It's skill. It's that Chi--</p>", "<p> \t \t \tCharlie Rose: They have more skills than American workers? They have more skills than--</p>", "<p> \t \t \tTim Cook: Now-- now, hold on.</p>", "<p> \t \t \tCharlie Rose: --German workers?</p>", "<p> \t \t \tTim Cook: Yeah, let me-- let me-- let me clear, China put an enormous focus on manufacturing. In what we would call, you and I would call vocational kind of skills. The U.S., over time, began to stop having as many vocational kind of skills. I mean, you can take every tool and die maker in the United States and probably put them in a room that we're currently sitting in. In China, you would have to have multiple football fields.</p>", "<p> \t \t \tCharlie Rose: Because they've taught those skills in their schools?</p>", "<p> \t \t \tTim Cook: It's because it was a focus of them-- it's a focus of their educational system. And so that is the reality.</p>", "<p> \t \t \tManufacting in China has brought serious labor concerns to Apple about low wages, long hours and unsafe conditions. After a series of suicides at Foxconn in 2010, the company installed safety nets outside its employee dormitories.</p>", "<p> \t \t \tCharlie Rose: Do you have a responsibility to look at the labor conditions in the places where you manufacture and make sure that whatever might be an incentive for people to commit suicide is eradicated?</p>", "<p> \t \t \tTim Cook: The answer to your question is yes. We have a responsibility and we do it. We are constantly auditing our supply chain. Making sure that safety standards are, are, you know, are the highest. We're making sure that working conditions are the highest. All of the things that you would expect us to look for and more, we're doing it.</p>", "<p> \t \t \tAccording to its most recent internal review, Apple has limited the work week to 60 hours, raised pay, and cracked down on child labor. But 30 percent of the facilities that make its products around the world still do not meet Apple's own safety standards.</p>", "<p> \t \t \tTim Cook: We believe that a company that has values and acts on them can really change the world.</p>", "<p> \t \t \tSince taking over Apple, Tim Cook has broadened his company's mission beyond making products. Apple has invested billions in renewable energy to power its data centers and other operations. Cook has also become a strong advocate for human rights. His motives are personal. He grew up during segregation in Alabama and last year, he made a bold public announcement that he is gay.</p>", "<p> \t \t \tCharlie Rose: No other CEO of a Fortune 500 company that might be gay has come out. You said it was God's greatest gift to you.</p>", "<p> \t \t \tTim Cook: When you're in a minority group, it gives you a sense of empathy of what it's like to be in the minority. And you begin to look at things from different point of views. And I think it was a gift for me.</p>", "<p> \t \t \tCharlie Rose: Why didn't you come out earlier?</p>", "<p> \t \t \tTim Cook: Well, I, honestly, I value my privacy. I'm a very private person. But it became increasingly clear to me that if I said something, that it could help other people. And I'm glad because I think that some kid somewhere, some kid in Alabama, I think if they just for a moment stop and say, \"If it didn't limit him, it may not limit me.\" Or this kid that's getting bullied or this kid that's co-- worse, I've gotten notes from people contemplating suicide. And so if I could touch just one of those, it's worth it. And I couldn't look myself in the mirror without doing it.</p>", "<p> \t \t \tBefore we finished reporting our story, Cook wanted to show us \"one more thing,\" as Steve Jobs used to say --- a glimpse of Apple's future. So we packed into four-by-fours and with cameras, drones, and technicians supplied by GoPro we ascended this giant mound of dirt that has been excavated during the construction of Apple's new corporate headquarters. It is the company's biggest project ever.</p>", "<p> \t<figure class=\"image pull-none image-x-large \"><span class=\"img \"><img src=\"http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/12/21/7378a9f9-6b22-468b-9198-7be50ca5e4d1/thumbnail/770x430/9719a255cf9247dcb1b7be0c26bfe70b/apple21.jpg\" alt=\"apple21.jpg\" height=\"430\" width=\"770\"></span><figcaption><div class=\"caption\">Apple's new corporate headquarters under construction</div><div class=\"credit\">\n                                            CBS News\n                                        </div></figcaption></figure>Charlie Rose: This is like a small city.</p>", "<p> \t \t \tTim Cook: It is.

It's a lot. It's somewhere near there.</p>", "<p> \t \t \tCharlie Rose: I knew 5 billion was a lot.</p>", "<p> \t \t \tTim Cook: We think it's so important to have a place that inspires you.</p>", "<p> \t</p>", "<p>It's wider than the Pentagon and when it's completed next year, 80 percent of the grounds will be landscaped with 7,000 trees and plants.

And the entire facility will be off the energy grid, powered mainly by solar panels.</p>", "<p> \t \t \tCharlie Rose: Here's what's interesting about this: it is at the core of Apple is this capacity to think about everything as building a product.</p>", "<p> \t \t \tTim Cook: Yeah.

And the die-hard fans: their expectations are out of this world. </p>", "<p>[Trailer: The Force. It's calling to you. ]</p>", "<p>When the official trailer was posted online, it was viewed 112 million times in just 24 hours.  </p>", "<p>[Kylo Ren: Nothing will stand in our way.]</p>", "<p>Bill Whitaker: Talk about the Force.

Abrams: The experience of it was so profound and so moving and so funny and so sweet that for me, as a kid -- it -- it blew my mind. And it was just -- it said, \"Anything is possible.\" </p>", "<p>Abrams has been working on \"The Force Awakens\" non-stop for three years.  He's managed to keep a tight lid on it. This is one of the few clips Disney has released.  He told us his movie is set about 30 years after \"Return of the Jedi,\" the final film in the first trilogy. At the end of that movie, the good guys had vanquished the empire and subdued the dark side...or so it seemed.   </p>", "<p>Bill Whitaker: What has been going on in that galaxy? </p>", "<p>J.J. Abrams: \"Return of the Jedi\" seemed to end pretty happily. But the walk off to the sunset is -- is always -- a misleading thing, because, \"Well, then what?\" And so one of the things that I think you see in this movie is that things didn't just end happily, and that the idea of the force, both the dark and the light side -- are at a classic Star Wars -- place, which is -- in a desperate moment.</p>", "<p>A moment which forces a new generation to step up. </p>", "<p>[Finn: We can't outrun them.</p>", "<p>Rey: We might.

Abrams: When we started casting the movie, it felt incredibly important to me that the movie look like the world in which this movie is being released.</p>", "<p>Abrams didn't just direct the movie, he wrote it with Lawrence Kasdan, who wrote two of the original Star Wars with Lucas. Abrams knew from the start he would tell a story that blended the new with the old. Taking his cue from the first trilogy, he made authenticity paramount, shooting in far flung locales, like this desert in Abu Dhabi; the sets were built from scratch ... the explosions were real. </p>", "<p>Bill Whitaker: Were there times when you stepped back from being the director and you were just the fan on the set?</p>", "<p>J.J. Abrams: It was very hard to be in the 125-degree heat in Abu Dhabi with actual Stormtroopers running through this village that we had built, and not have moments constantly of, \"Holy -- what the -- you know, I can't believe I'm here.\" It was constantly happening, and I had to suppress that and say, \"Yep, okay, let's do it,\" and like put that away, because the job was not to be a wide-eyed fan boy. The job was to be the director of the movie.</p>", "<p>[Abrams: Energy and action!]</p>", "<p>As the director, he managed a cast and crew of almost a thousand. He set limits on computer generated imagery. Most of Abrams' creatures, like the new droid BB-8, were crafted by hand, including his own.  </p>", "<p>J.J. Abrams: We knew he had to have a hero droid that was not -- a familiar one. </p>", "<p>Bill Whitaker: And you came up with a concept, like, by sketching it out?</p>", "<p>J.J. Abrams: I drew -- the dumbest little thing. I just, I -- I drew something like -- like this. </p>", "<p>He gave his sketch to the creature department, a group of about 100 artists and designers.  They made a puppet.  </p>", "<p>J.J. Abrams: And the puppeteer, came out with BB-8. And he was moving around. And it was, like \"Oh my god, it lives.\" </p>", "<p>[Rey: Where do you come from?]</p>", "<p>We watched as Abrams worked on one scene where the droid meets Rey for the first time.</p>", "<p>J.J.

And I'm a little -- you know --</p>", "<p>J.J. Abrams: Brutally -- brutally honest.</p>", "<p>Katie McGrath: I'm -- I'm honest.  And at the end of the day, it's a movie. You know, this is not curing cancer. This is not eradicating poverty. This is -- this is making a movie. Right? Right? That's what you believe, right?</p>", "<p>J.J. Abrams: I'm sorry. She lost me after, \"This is just a movie.\" I was like --</p>", "<p>Jeffrey Jacob Abrams' grew up in Hollywood's backyard, not far from the big studios. But when he took a tour of a movie backlot at age 8, he knew he'd found his calling. </p>", "<p>Bill Whitaker: What in particular drew you to it?</p>", "<p>J.J. Abrams: I think the thing that was so cool is the whole thing felt like a magic trick, that it was -- it was every aspect of illusion, of creating something that seemed like it was actual -- actually happening and real. </p>", "<p>He picked up the family's home movie camera and tried his own sleight of hand. </p>", "<p>[The Attic: Now we seek revenge!]</p>", "<p>He admits his earliest works weren't that good. But he got better. He won a teen film festival and got written up in the Los Angeles Times. That's him in the middle. The article caught the eye of Steven Spielberg. He reached out to the young filmmaker, who reminded him of himself. Today Spielberg is Abrams' friend, collaborator and a big fan.</p>", "<p>Bill Whitaker: What first struck you about him?</p>", "<p>Steven Spielberg: He just reminded me of a cartoon character that was so full of magnetic energy and ideas coming out of him, sometimes just like sparks flying in all directions. He was just absolutely, deliriously, madly in love with the film business and with making movies. </p>", "<p>The kid in Abrams is on display at Bad Robot, his Santa Monica production company. He says this quirky place is a grown up version of his childhood bedroom -- with toys, an art area, and a place for special effects.  Here, about 90 employees churn out a constant stream of movies, TV shows, video games and apps. Abrams stage manages it all.  </p>", "<p>Bill Whitaker: He's kind of, like, all over the place. Is it difficult?</p>", "<p>Katie McGrath: I don't even try. It can give you a bit of a complex if -- that you don't have enough hobbies in your life. But he --</p>", "<p>Bill Whitaker: You're -- you're not doing enough.</p>", "<p>Katie McGrath: No, no. And I'm doing plenty, by the way. But this is a whole other ballgame. He's, you know, he --</p>", "<p>J.J. Abrams: I'm right here, guys--</p>", "<p>Katie McGrath: I know. This is so weird. </p>", "<p>J.J. Abrams: Bill, it's like \"Sixth Sense.\" Bill, Katie.</p>", "<p>Bill Whitaker: But it's good energy.</p>", "<p>Katie McGrath: No, it's great energy, actually.</p>", "<p>He sold his first screenplay in college. He went on to write or co-write five more movies including the blockbuster \"Armageddon.\" He made several TV shows. The cult hit \"Lost,\" about plane crash survivors on a mysterious island, won him two Emmys.  </p>", "<p>[Lost: You're going to be OK, do you understand me?</p>", "<p>J.J. Abrams: Cut. That was awesome!]</p>", "<p>After that, his rousing remakes of flagging franchises \"Mission: Impossible\" and \"Star Trek\" grossed more than one billion dollars worldwide and earned Abrams the reputation as the remake king. He found himself in a financially lucrative, but creative rut. He decided to move on from sequels. Then fate -- in the form of a conversation between Steven Spielberg and Star Wars producer Kathy Kennedy -- changed his destiny.</p>", "<p>Steven Spielberg: And I just said, \"Kathy there's only one director that really should undertake this daunting epic task, and that's J.J. Abrams.\" </p>", "<p>His daunting task: to justify Disney's $4 billion investment, plus the estimated $200 million it cost to make the movie. Wall Street will be disappointed if it doesn't bring in more than $1.5 billion.  </p>", "<p>Bill Whitaker: What's going on in his head right now?</p>", "<p>Steven Spielberg: Oh -- J.J. is terrified. There's a lot of pressure on J.J. -- to start paying Disney back for-- you know, the franchise they bought from -- from George Lucas. </p>", "<p>J.J. Abrams: You just know that there will be people, no matter what you do, that will have issues with some aspect. You just know there is some number that is being thrown out there that will not be hit. You just know. </p>", "<p>Fans have snapped up more than $50 million in advance tickets. In Hollywood, they started lining up outside the theater a week ago.

And that's what makes 'em bad. And so I always exposed the weakness rather than the nastiness.  But you got the nastiness anyway.</p>", "<p> \tOver the next couple of years, he made a few clunkers.</p>", "<p> \t<em>[Hoagie from \"Jaws 4\": You're all the same. Complain, complain.]</em></p>", "<p> \tHe came to the harsh realization that his career was fading.</p>", "<p> \tMichael Caine: You don't retire from the movies.

And I sent it back to the producer saying-- \"I don't wanna do it. The part's too small.\" And he sent it back to me, he said, \"You shouldn't read the lover. You should read the father.\"</p>", "<p> \tSo he reinvented himself as a father figure and it paid off.  At 67, Caine won his second Oscar for actor in a supporting role in \"The Cider House Rules.\"</p>", "<p> \t <em>[Dr. Wilbur Larch from \"The Cider House Rules\": Good night you princes of Maine, you kings of New England.] </em></p>", "<p> \tA few months later, he got the ultimate accolade when Queen Elizabeth knighted Him Sir Maurice Micklewhite, not bad for a bloke from the slums of south London.</p>", "<p> \t</p>", "<p>Michael Caine: It's the best award I ever had because you get the Academy Award, it's about a performance.

When asked if she believed the Vermont senator was tough enough on the issue, she responded, \"No, not at all.\" </p>", "<p>\"I think that we have to look at the fact that we lose 90 people a day from gun violence,\" Clinton said. \"This has gone on too long, and it's time the entire country stood up against the NRA.

I think there is a vast majority in this country who want to do the right thing and I intend to lead the country in bringing the people together.\" </p>", "<p>O'Malley argued against the Vermont independent, saying that it was \"not about rural\" communities versus urban ones.</p>", "<p>The Maryland Democrat spoke of his own record in passing firearm regulations in his own state. </p>", "<p>\"We are able to pass this,\" he said of his state, \"and still respect the hunting traditions of people who lived in our rural areas and we did it by leading by principle not by pandering to the NRA.\" </p>", "<p>Sanders shot back, \"I don't think I am pandering, but you have not been in the United States Congress.\"</p>"], "article_author": ["Reena Flores"]}

Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., continues to rail against the Obama administration for what he says are unanswered questions about \"what transpired before, during and after the attack on our consulate.\" As a result, he's demanding that the nomination of John Brennan as CIA director be delayed until he is satisfied that his inquiries have been suitably answered.</p>", "<p>\"I have not forgotten about the Benghazi debacle and still have many questions about what transpired before, during and after the attack on our consulate,\" Graham said today in a statement. \"I do not believe we should confirm anyone as Director of the CIA until our questions are answered.\"  </p>", "<p>Brennan is the second high-profile presidential nomination that Graham has protested on these grounds: He, along with Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., were critical in derailing U.N. ambassador Susan Rice's prospects at being named secretary of state. Rice withdrew her name from consideration for the post last month after protracted attacks from Graham, McCain, Ayotte and other Republicans, who targeted initial comments she made about the September attacks in a series of talk show appearances a few days later.</p>", "<p>In his statement, Graham points to a lack of clarity over talking points the CIA gave to Rice ahead of those appearances, which were edited to exclude reference of the likely involvement by terrorists and an al-Qaeda affiliate in the attack.</p>", "<p>\"We were first told the Director of National Intelligence deleted the Al-Qaeda reference in the talking points because they did not want to let al Qaeda know we were monitoring them.  We were then told the FBI changed the talking points so as not to compromise an ongoing criminal investigation.  Finally, during a meeting with Ambassador Rice and acting-CIA Director Morrell, I was told it was the FBI who changed the talking points,\" Graham said in the statement. \"However, later in the day the clarified it was the CIA who had changed the talking points.\"</p>", "<p>In late November, acting CIA Director Mike Morrell and Rice mete privately with Graham, McCain, and Ayotte specifically to address their questions about the Benghazi attacks. In that meeting, Morrell said he believed it was the FBI that removed the references, despite previous accounts stating the edits had been the work of the CIA. Morrell later retracted that statement, saying he \"misspoke\" and that the CIA was, in fact, responsible.</p>", "<p>After that meeting, Graham said he was \"more disturbed now than I was before\" about the explanations he had received on the subject.</p>", "<p>White House Press Secretary Jay Carney has repeatedly dismissed what he called the \"obsessive focus\" on Rice's initial comments as \"misplaced and misguided,\" and says President Obama is more concerned with figuring out what happened in Benghazi and how to prevent future occurrences than playing politics on the issue. The administration has also accepted the conclusions of a critical independent report detailing the the incident, and two top State Department officials recently testified about the report in front of separate House and Senate committees. Outgoing Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is also expected to testify on the incident in the future.</p>", "<p>Graham, who is up for reelection in 2014 and has also criticized Chuck Hagel, Mr. Obama's pick for defense secretary, says he is not ready to let the issue rest.<br></p>", "<p>\"Who changed Ambassador Susan Rice's talking points and deleted the references to Al-Qaeda?\" Graham asked again today in his statement. \"This ever-changing story should be resolved.\"</p>"], "article_author": ["Lucy Madison"]}

The \"Super Troopers\" actor gave the company the green light to try to access his Twitter account with nothing more than his name. What he found out was that his entire digital life could have been compromised using simple techniques.</p>", "<p>SecureState profiling consultant Brandan Geise went on a mission to hack into Stolhanske's Twitter account, but instead was also able to gain access to his Amazon, AOL, Apple and Dropbox accounts, as well his Web hosting account. </p>", "<p>A manipulation tactic called social engineering can give anyone smart enough to connect the dots a gateway into your digital domain. It doesn't require a single line of programming code. </p>", "<p>\"Pretty much anyone can do this,\" Geise told CBSNews.com. </p>", "<p>Geise started by running a search of Stolhanske's name on Spokeo.com, a website that aggregates public information about people. Information found on Spokeo can include a home phone number, email address, all associated home addresses, family members and occupation. It took two pieces of information from Spokeo to gain access to Stolhanske's Amazon.com account: an email and home address. </p>", "<p>Amazon has a feature called wish lists that let members bookmark items that they want to buy and save them in a list. Anyone can run a search for wish lists using either a name or email address. That may be convenient when friends or relatives are wondering what you want for your birthday, but it can make you vulnerable. By trying all of the email addresses found on Spokeo, Geise was able to find Stolhanske's Amazon wish list, confirming that he also had a registered account. </p>", "<p>The next step would be the key to making the rest of the dominoes drop. </p>", "<p>Geise called Amazon customer service and asked to add a credit card using an account name, email address and billing address. When it came time to verify his identity, Geise told the Amazon representative that he forgot which home address he used for the account, and went down the list he obtained from Spokeo. A match was found, and he was able to add a credit card to the account.  </p>", "<p>After hanging up, he called back 30 minutes later saying he lost access to his account and backup email address. Geise was able to verify his identity by using the last four digits of the credit card he added in his previous call. He faced one last hurdle: Amazon required him to name an item that he recently purchased. Geise was able to bypass this requirement partially due to thorough research and a bit of luck.</p>", "<p>During his initial research, Geise found a lot of personal information on Stolhanske just by going through his Twitter and Facebook posts.</p>", "<p>\"It definitely required a lot of recon work,\" Geise said. \"But to find that kind of information, you don't have to dig that deep.\"</p>", "<p>Geise knew from social media that Stolhanske was a fan of the HBO series \"Game of Thrones.\" He told the Amazon customer representative that he rarely used the account, and that his wife may have purchased a \"Game of Thrones\" book or DVD. It was an educated guess that turned out to be correct. </p>", "<p>He was in. </p>", "<p>Geise was allowed to change the email address and reset the password to the account. </p>", "<p>\"Once I had access to Erik's account, there were quite a few credit cards on there. It didn't show the full credit card number, but showed the last four digits,\" Geise said. </p>", "<p>He points out that most of the times when are people asked to verify an account, they are asked for the last four digits of the card and a billing address. Armed with that information, Geise went down the line and accessed the rest of Stolhanske's accounts -- starting with AOL. </p>", "<p>Geise was able to gain access to Stolhanske's AOL account over the phone, by providing just his billing address and last four digits of his credit card number. </p>", "<p>Many people link accounts together, so breaching the right combination of accounts could lead to a jackpot for a cyber criminal. In Stolhanske's case, accessing the Amazon and AOL accounts opened the door for taking over his digital life. As it turns out, Stolhanske's AOL account was the email address used to reset his Apple account, which was also his main email address. After taking control of the Apple account, Geise was able to search Stolhanske's emails to find other accounts associated with the email address, and send requests to reset passwords.</p>", "<p>If this all sounds familiar, it's because a similar case was reported last year, when a hacker gained access to Wired reporter Mat Honan's <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/08/apple-amazon-mat-honan-hacking/all\">email, Twitter, Amazon and Apple accounts</a>. Wired later <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/08/amazon-changes-policy-wont-add-new-credit-cards-to-accounts-over-the-phone/\">reported </a>that Amazon quietly closed the loophole that allowed a hacker to add a credit card to an account, but Geise says the only additional hurdle he faced was naming a recent purchase. </p>", "<p>Amazon declined to comment on Geise's claims. </p>", "<p>Geise says using two-factor authentication could stop the potential hacker in their tracks because it would also require access personal devices, like a smartphone. But it would not make the social engineering hack impossible to accomplish. Apple, Twitter and Facebook have added the additional security measure in the last year.</p>", "<p>Sometimes it could just be negligence of old accounts that could be the weak link. In Stolhanske's case, it was the combination of being on social media, having old mailing addresses listed on his account and having a public Amazon wish list that caused a chain effect.  </p>", "<p>Geise suggests deleting old email accounts, adding complex passwords, using random email accounts for password recovery and making Amazon wish lists private. </p>"], "article_author": ["Chenda Ngak"]}

It would probably be unconstitutional.\"</p>", "<p>There are many forms non-U.S. citizens abroad file to seek temporary or permanent immigrant visas, and none require disclosure of religion. Similarly, immigrants who have been legally admitted to the U.S. and are looking to become permanent residents are also not asked about their religion. </p>", "<p>That omission is no mistake. A 2012 U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services policy memorandum instructs immigration officers, \"Avoid questions about a person's religious beliefs or practices unless they are relevant to determine the individual's eligibility for a benefit. Do not make any comments that might be taken as a negative reflection upon any other person, race, religion, or country.\"</p>", "<p>If an immigration official asks about an immigrant's religion and then uses the answer as the basis for denial of relief, \"that could be a constitutional violation,\" Greg Chen, the director of advocacy at the American Immigration Lawyers Association, told CBS News.  This comes into play especially in cases when immigrants have already been legally admitted to the U.S. because, says Chen, a court could find that their equal protection rights have been violated.</p>", "<p>The U.S. has used nationality as the basis for immigration policy in the past, but those occasions are not exactly among the country's finer moments. The Chinese Exclusion Act banned all people of Chinese descent from coming to the U.S. for decades before being overturned in 1943.</p>", "<p>In 1942, President Roosevelt signed an executive order that authorized the internment of 110,000 American citizens of Japanese descent. The Supreme Court ruled that decision constitutional in Korematsu v. United States, and although the ruling stands, the prevailing view is that it was a shameful decision. Dissenting Justice Robert Jackson said it \"validated the principle of racial discrimination in criminal procedure.\"</p>", "<p>It's not the kind of policy that would hold up in court today, asserted Khaled Abou El Fadl, a human rights law professor at the University of California Law School. \"It was an open state of war,\" he told CBS News, referring to World War II.</p>", "<p>One troubling issue Abou El Fadl did identify in Trump's proposal is the disregard shown for the United States' commitment to international bodies and human rights charters that forbid religious discrimination - all of which the U.S. helped pioneer.</p>", "<p>\"Trump seems to have just not bothered to read the Constitution or any international law or even have any regard for it,\" he said. \"You're not going to take an action like that without opening the door and validating other countries reciprocating in kind or choosing having their own choice of bogeyman.\"</p>", "<p>Still, Korematsu, because it has never been struck down, may remain a legal avenue -- if narrow -- for Trump's Muslim exclusion idea. In Feb. 2014, according to the Washington Post, Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia told students at the University of Hawaii that the Korematsu decision was wrong, and then added, \"But you are kidding yourself if you think the same thing will not happen again.\" he said. \"In times of war, the laws fall silent.\"</p>", "<p>Jackson's dissent at the time, 75 years ago, imagined the precedent Korematsu set for future generations fearing unknown threats. He wrote, \"The principle then lies about like a loaded weapon, ready for the hand of any authority that can bring forward a plausible claim of an urgent need.

According to the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/national/black-budget/\">Washington Post,</a> the U.S. intelligence community has a so-called \"black budget\" for fiscal year 2013 that allocated $52.6 billion, of which the NSA received $10.5 billion.<br></p>", "<p>\"Unless the information you are sending is only useful for a short period of time, this is probably the greatest threat to the data -- time.

But even with all of the security measures in place, Sell believes there is plenty of room for human error. </p>", "<p>What cryptographers aim to do is slow down potential eavesdroppers. Sell says this can be done by creating difficult, expensive and time-consuming obstacles. There are still several options for keeping a basic level of privacy. Sell suggests doing a factory reset on devices from time to time, to ensure malicious software is not installed. Several of the experts recommend using PGP. </p>", "<p>\"All of these things are better than doing nothing, and sending clear text,\" iSEC senior security consultant Shawn Fitzgerald says. Although he's concerned about the alleged breach of privacy, Fitzgerald doesn't believe that NSA snooping will not affect people's daily routine. <br></p>", "<p>And it's not just the government that has an interest in collecting data online. Cybersecurity professionals believe that using privacy tools is still important because it can deter hackers who are looking for sensitive information.</p>", "<p>\"Something else to keep in mind is that the NSA is one of the most well provisioned agencies in the world, but they're not your only adversary,\" says Steve Weiss, founder and CTO of security firm PrivateCore. \"Different degrees of privacy are still achievable.

The ad lays out Coca-Cola's record of providing drinks with fewer calories over the years and notes that weight gain is the result of consuming too many calories of any kind -- not just soda.</p>", "<p>The campaign will kick off a variety of moves that help address obesity in the year ahead, such as providing more diet options at soda fountains, Coca-Cola says.</p>", "<p>More than one-third of U.S. adults are obese, so too are approximately 17 percent of children and adolescents between 2 and 19 years old according to federal estimates.

In March 2013, New York City is set to put into effect a first-in-the-nation cap on the size of soft drinks sold at restaurants, movie theaters, sports arenas and other venues. The rule will require a maximum 16-ounce cap on drinks sold at these establishments that fall under the New York City Health Department's jurisdiction. The plan has been met by opposition from the soda industry, which <span class=\"link\"><a href=\"/news/soda-industry-sues-nyc-over-sugary-drink-limits\">filed suit in October.</a></span></p>", "<p>The mayor of Cambridge, Mass., has already <span class=\"link\"><a href=\"/news/big-soda-ban-proposed-by-mayor-of-cambridge-mass\">proposed a similar measure</a></span>, saying she was inspired by New York's move.</p>", "<p>Even when PepsiCo Inc., the No. 2 soda maker, recently signed a wide-ranging endorsement deal with pop singer Beyonce, critics called for the singer to drop the contract or donate the funds to groups that fund health initiatives.</p>", "<p>Michael Jacobson, executive director for the watchdog, the <a href=\"http://www.cspinet.org/new/201301142.html\">Center for Science in the Public Interest</a>, was skeptical about Coca-Cola's ads and said the company would stop fighting soda taxes if it was serious about helping reduce obesity.</p>", "<p>\"It looks like a page out of damage control 101,\" he said. \"They're trying to disarm the public.\"</p>", "<p>The group has been critical of the soft drink industry and last year released a <a href=\"http://www.therealbears.org/\">video parodying</a> Coke's famous polar bears becoming plagued with diabetes and other health problems.</p>", "<p>Diana Garza Ciarlante, a spokeswoman for Coca-Cola Co., said the new ads aren't a reaction to any negative public sentiment but that the company felt it needed to address \"the issue of the times\" and be part of the discussion on obesity.</p>", "<p>\"We have not done a good enough job in telling our story and being consistent in telling our story,\" she said, noting the company had to be careful in its messaging to remain consistent with its brand voice and avoid sounding \"preachy.\"</p>", "<p>In the ad, a narrator notes that obesity is an issue that \"concerns all of us\" but that people can make a difference when they \"come together.\" The spot was produced by Brighthouse and Citizen2 and is intended to reflect Coca-Cola's corporate responsibility among cable news viewers.</p>", "<p>Another ad, which will run later this week during \"American Idol\" and before the Super Bowl, is much more reminiscent of catchy, upbeat advertising people have come to expect from Coca-Cola. It features a montage of activities that add up to burning off the \"140 happy calories\" in a can of Coke: walking a dog, dancing, sharing a laugh with friends and doing a victory dance after bowling a strike.</p>", "<p>Garza Ciarlante said the 30-second ad, a version of which ran in Brazil last month, is intended to address confusion about the number of calories in soda. She said the company's consumer research showed people thought there were as many as 900 calories in a can of soda.</p>", "<p>The company declined to say how much it was spending on the commercials, which it started putting together last summer. It also declined to give details on its plans for the year ahead. But among the options under consideration is putting the amount of activity needed to burn off the calories in a drink on cans and bottles.</p>", "<p>Coca-Cola noted it has already made several moves to help customers make smarter choices, such as putting calorie counts on the front of its cans and bottles in the U.S. Last year, it also started posting calorie information on its vending machines ahead of a regulation that will require soda companies to do so by 2014.</p>", "<p>Public concern over calories counts is apparent in Coca-Cola's business. In North America, all the growth in its soda business over the past 15 years has come from low- and no-calorie drinks, such as Coke Zero. Diet sodas now account for nearly a third of its sales in the U.S. and Canada. Other beverages, such as sports drinks and bottled water, are also fueling growth.</p>", "<p>Even with the growing popularity of diet sodas, however, overall soda consumption in the U.S. has declined steadily since 1998, according to the industry tracker Beverage Digest.</p>", "<p>John Sicher, the publisher of Beverage Digest, noted that the industry \"put its head in the sand\" when obesity and soft drinks first started becoming an issue more than a decade ago.

Her husband, Syed Farook, a 28-year-old health inspector for the county, was born in Chicago to Pakistani parents and raised in Southern California.</p>", "<p>\"Each of them served their fellow citizens. All of them were part of our American family,\" the president said of the victims. </p>", "<p>He said that so far, there was no indication that the attack was directed by a terrorist organization overseas or that they were part of a larger conspiracy at home. </p>", "<p>\"But it is clear that the two of them had gone down the dark path of radicalization, embracing a perverted interpretation of Islam that calls for war against America and the West,\" he said. \"This was an act of terrorism designed to kill innocent people.\"</p>", "<p>Mr. Obama did not announce major changes to his plans to fight ISIS, even though that strategy came under question after the group claimed responsibility for a major <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/paris-attacks/\">terrorist attack in Paris</a> last month in which gunmen killed 130 people around the city. He said the current strategy is supported by military and counterterrorism experts.</p>", "<p>\"We constantly examine our strategy to determine additional steps to get the job done,\" he said.</p>", "<p>Mr. Obama said the terror threat has evolved since the days of the 9/11 attacks and outlined a four-pronged strategy: hunt down terrorist leaders in every country where they are; provide training and equipment to Iraqi and Syrian forces fighting ISIS on the ground; stop ISIS operations, financing and recruiting; and establish a ceasefire and political resolution to the Syrian civil war. </p>", "<p>\"Our success won't depend on tough talk or abandoning our values or giving into fear. That's what groups like ISIL are hoping for. Instead we will prevail by being strong and smart, resilient and relentless, and by drawing on every aspect of American power,\" he said.</p>", "<p>Mr. Obama called on Congress to take several steps: Pass legislation banning those on the no-fly list from purchasing a gun, reduce the accessibility of assault weapons, enhance screening for visa waiver entrants and pass an Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF) that is specific to the fight against ISIS.</p>", "<p>The White House has already taken some steps to strengthen security for the visa waiver program, which allows people from 38 countries to travel to the U.S. without obtaining a visa in advance. It <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/obama-tightens-visa-waiver-program-after-paris-attacks/\">announced last week</a> it would take steps to evaluate whether potential travelers in the program have traveled to countries deemed terrorist safe havens.</p>", "<p>Previous attempts at working on an AUMF to Congress fizzled after House Speaker John Boehner <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/grim-future-obama-aumf-request-fight-isis/\">expressed discontent</a> with the initial draft from the White House. Plus, there has been widespread agreement that the 2001 AUMF granting the White House the authority to fight al Qaeda also covers the fight against ISIS.</p>", "<p>\"If Congress believes, as I do, that we are at war with ISIL, it should go ahead and vote to authorize the continued use of military force against these terrorists,\" Mr. Obama said. \"I think it's time for Congress to vote to demonstrate that the American people are united and committed to this fight</p>", "<p>The president spent the final part of his speech focusing on what the country would not do as he reiterated a pledge to avoid a \"long and costly ground war\" in Iraq or Syria. He also implored Americans not to turn on all Muslims.</p>", "<p>\"We cannot turn against one another by letting this fight be defined as a war between America and Islam. That too is what groups like ISIL want. ISIL does not speak for Islam. They are thugs and killers, part of a cult of death,\" the president said, noting that the \"vast majority\" of terror victims around the world are Muslim.</p>", "<p>He called it the \"responsibility of all Americans of every faith to reject discrimination,\" religious tests for entrance to the country or proposals to treat Muslim Americans differently.</p>", "<p>\"That does not mean denying the fact that an extremist ideology has spread within some Muslim communities. That is a real problem that some Muslims must confront without excuse,\" the president said. He argued the U.S. should \"enlist\" Muslim communities as allies in the fight.</p>", "<p>\"Muslim Americans are our friends and our neighbors, our coworkers, our sports heroes, and yes, they are our men and women in uniform who are willing to die in defense of our country. We have to remember that,\" he said.</p>", "<p>A senior administration official explained that the president felt compelled to address the nation Sunday \"because of the attacks in Paris, followed by the shooting in San Bernardino, which clearly raised people's concerns about the nature of the terrorist threat that we face.\" And the California attack last week is being investigated now as \"an act of terrorism,\" the official said. \"We do see that they went down a path of radicalization and that they had stockpiled weapons with the intent to kill innocents on a substantial scale.\"</p>", "<p>This was only the president's third speech from the Oval Office. His last address from this room was in 2010.</p>"], "article_author": ["Rebecca Kaplan"]}

Following Alphabet's better-than-expected quarterly results, its shares rose more than 9 percent at one point, later trimming the gains to about 4.6 percent.</p>", "<p> \tSimply reorganizing how Alphabet's results were reported -- dividing core Google results from so-called \"moonshot\" activities like automated vehicles -- as well as ongoing strength in digital ad revenue helped do the trick.</p>", "<p> \tMany investors remember the accounting gimmickry that led to the Enron fiasco.

Net operating cash flow totaled $6.4 billion, thanks to a slowdown in capital spending.</p>", "<p> \tRevenue for the Google operating segment totaled $21.2 billion vs. $18 billion last year. On the earnings call, management noted that the increased use of mobile search was the single largest contributor to the robust quarter.</p>", "<p> <br>\tWhile Apple still enjoys a larger cash pile than Alphabet (more than $200 billion vs. $73 billion, respectively), the latter's market capitalization (shares outstanding multiplied by the share price) is now roughly $570 billion vs. $535 billion for Apple. The last time Alphabet's corporate predecessor, Google, was more valuable than Apple was in February 2010, when both were worth less than $200 billion. That was before the iPad and before the iPhone 4 established Apple's dominance in mobile computing.</p>", "<p> \tIn 2011, Apple passed Exxon Mobil  \t(<a href=\"http://markets.cbsnews.com/XOM/quote/\">XOM</a>) to become the world's largest company.</p>", "<p> \tNow, with the smartphone and tablet markets saturated, and Apple lagging behind peers in new-tech areas like virtual reality and autonomous transportation, Alphabet has retaken the crown not because of the successes of its Android mobile software or Nexus mobile hardware but because of its growing share of the mobile ad market.</p>", "<p> \tAccording to eMarketer, Google is poised to take 32 percent of the mobile ad market this year ahead of  \tFacebook<strong> \t</strong>(<a href=\"http://markets.cbsnews.com/FB/quote/\">FB</a>) at 20 percent.</p>", "<p> \tIn fact, the importance of commanding the mobile ad market can be seen in the way Facebook passed Exxon Mobil on Monday to becomes the world's third-most-valuable company.</p>"], "article_author": ["Anthony Mirhaydari"]}

If not for employee stock expenses and certain other items, Google said it would have earned $8.67 per share. That figure easily topped the average estimate of $8.10 per share among analysts surveyed by FactSet.</p>", "<p>The earnings report provided the most detailed breakdown yet on the profits pouring in from Google's dominant search engine and ad network. (Google reorganized itself under Alphabet last October.) Investors pushed up Alphabet stock $44.23, or more than 5 percent, to $815 in extended trading on Monday.</p>", "<p>Based on that after-hours bump, Alphabet surpassed Apple as the world's most valuable publicly traded company. According to calculations from S&amp;P Indices, Alphabet was worth $571 billion versus $538 billion for Apple. That ranking, of course, could shift again in regular trading Tuesday.</p>", "<p>Apple's stock has been sliding amid concerns about a slowdown in iPhone sales. Alphabet's stock has surged by 45 percent since the end of 2014 when it was still trading under Google's name.</p>", "<p>The fourth-quarter report marks the first time Alphabet has spelled out the costs of running still-experimental businesses that are trying to do everything from eliminating human drivers to curing cancer.</p>", "<p>Until now, the expenses of running those peripheral operations had been hidden in Google's financial statement. The company's opaque accounting made it difficult to know just how much profit Google reaped from its primary business -- selling digital ads next to everything from search results to YouTube videos.</p>", "<p>In the fourth quarter, Google produced an operating profit of $6.8 billion, excluding employee stock expenses, on revenue of $17.1 billion, after subtracting ad commissions. That translates into a whopping profit margin of 40 percent.</p>", "<p>Meanwhile, Alphabet's other companies together produced an operating loss of $1.2 billion on revenue of just $151 million. Alphabet labels that category \"other bets.\" That loss also excluded employee stock expenses.</p>", "<p>The optimism surrounding Alphabet stems in part from hopes that the company is developing more financial discipline as it discloses more earnings details. Google had become known for its free-spending habits and reluctance to share information with analysts.</p>", "<p>The change in sentiment coincided with Google's hiring of a new chief financial officer, Ruth Porat, last May. Porat, a Wall Street veteran, has consistently signaled her intent to rein in spending.</p>", "<p>Under the previous setup at Google, \"things had always been a little muddy,\" said Edward Jones analyst Josh Olson. \"The hope now is that management will continue to show greater cost discipline.\"</p>", "<p>Google is also counting on advertisers to gradually pay more for marketing messages on smartphones. They still aren't paying as much for mobile ads as on personal computers because the smaller screens on smartphones have been seen as an impediment. That's one reason Google's average ad rates, measured as \"cost per click,\" have been declining for more than four years.</p>", "<p>In the latest quarter, Google's cost per click fell by 13 percent from the same time in 2014. But Porat cited an increase in mobile search requests as one of biggest reasons that Google's revenue rose by 18 percent from the previous year. As people increasingly search for information and shop on their phones, the company expects advertisers to ramp up their spending on smartphones, too.</p>"], "article_author": ["February 1, 2016, 5:24 PM"]}

In her letter to the president today, Rice said she was \"saddened\" that the position had become so politicized, but argued Congress has more important battles to fight. </p>", "<p>\"I am highly honored to be considered by you for appointment as Secretary of State. I'm fully confident that I could serve our country ably and effectively in that role,\" she wrote. \"However, if nominated, I am now convinced that the confirmation process would be lengthy, disruptive and costly - to you and to our most pressing national and international priorities. That trade-off is simply not worth it to our country. It is far more important that we devote precious legislative hours and energy to enacting your core goals, including comprehensive immigration reform, balanced deficit reduction, job creation, and maintaining a robust national defense and effective U.S. global leadership. Therefore, I respectfully request that you no longer consider my candidacy at this time.\"</p>", "<p>In a statement, President Obama acknowledged that he had \"accepted\" Rice's decision to remove her name from consideration, and expressed \"every confidence\" in her ability to \"serve our country now and in the years to come.\" </p>", "<p>On Thursday evening, Rice tweeted: \"<a href=\"https://twitter.com/AmbassadorRice/status/279398996122935296\">Those of you</a> who know me know that I'm a fighter, but not at the cost of what's right for our country. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AmbassadorRice/status/279399767870676992\">I don't do this work</a> for me. I do it because I believe in President Obama's approach to the world, and I want to get things done. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AmbassadorRice/status/279400306046038016\">To all my followers</a>: I appreciate you. We've still got a lot of work to do for the American people and the world. #Letsgo.\"</p>", "<p>But the president, who fiercely defended Rice against the recent criticism, expressed deep regret over the attacks, which he called \"unfair and misleading.\" </p>", "<p>\"Her decision demonstrates the strength of her character, and an admirable commitment to rise above the politics of the moment to put our national interests first,\" Mr. Obama said in the statement. \"The American people can be proud to have a public servant of her caliber and character representing our country.\"  </p>", "<p>Diplomats at the U.N. were shocked at the withdrawal announcement, particularly because she appeared to be assured of the president's support, reports CBS News foreign affairs analyst Pamela Falk. Even her adversaries among the diplomatic corps at the U.N. had expressed their respect for her advocacy of U.S. interests.</p>", "<p>Nevertheless, Rice had begun to express doubts about her nomination, as recently as this week at a holiday celebration in her apartment in New York, which select members of the diplomatic and press corps attended, saying the attacks had reached a fevered pitch, Falk reports. </p>", "<p>On September 16, five days after the attacks in Benghazi that caused the death U.S. Ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens and three other Americans, Rice appeared on a handful of Sunday morning political talk shows to discuss the incident. Rice's comments on those shows were guided by CIA talking points that, according to a U.S. intelligence official, \"were written, upon request, so members of Congress and senior officials could say something preliminary and unclassified about the attacks,\" and reflected the possibility that the attacks were a result of spontaneous protests spurred by an anti-Muslim video.  </p>", "<p>As details trickled out contradicting that possibility, Republicans pounced on the discrepancies between Rice's comments and others, and the ambassador ultimately clarified that there had been \"no protest or demonstration in Benghazi\" and that \"the intelligence assessment [had] evolved\" since her Sept. 16 comments. <br></p>", "<p>A spokesperson for the Director of National Intelligence told CBS News that \"the intelligence community assessed from the very beginning that what happened in Benghazi was a terrorist attack,\" and that Rice would have been privy to that characterization -- which was shared at a classified level -- since she's a member of the president's cabinet. But CBS also learned that the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) cut specific references to \"al Qaeda\" and \"terrorism\" from the unclassified talking points given to Ambassador Susan Rice ahead of her television appearances. </p>", "<p>A handful of Republican lawmakers -- chiefly Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H. -- seized on the controversy, targeting Rice's credibility as a potential secretary of state in a series of recent press conferences and threatening to block her nomination. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, also questioned Rice's leadership, and offered up Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., as her preferable candidate for the job.</p>", "<p>Following Rice's announcement on Thursday, Graham released a statement saying he \"respected\" her decision, and that \"President Obama has many talented people to choose from to serve as our next Secretary of State.\" He said he remained \"determined\" to find out \"what happened - before, during, and after the attack\" in Libya.</p>", "<p>A brief statement from McCain spokesperson Brian Rogers reflected a similar sentiment: \"Senator McCain thanks Ambassador Rice for her service to the country and wishes her well. He will continue to seek all the facts surrounding the attack on our consulate in Benghazi that killed four brave Americans,\" he said. </p>", "<p>\"Face the Nation\" anchor Bob Schieffer reports key Senate Republicans quietly passed the word to Vice President Biden last week that it was going to be all but impossible for her to be confirmed.</p>", "<p>Biden was told there was virtually no support for Rice among Republicans and that some Democrats were also beginning to question whether she was the best choice.</p>", "<p>Additionally, Schieffer reports Rice seemed to be wavering recently about whether she really wanted the job. </p>", "<p>\"I have two children,\" she told Schieffer. \"I would want to talk to them. It would be a family decision.\" </p>", "<p>With regard to the scrutiny of her financial investments, Payton Knopf, Deputy Spokesperson of the U.S. Mission to the U.N. told CBS News, \"Ambassador Rice has complied with annual financial disclosure and applicable ethics requirements related to her service in the U.S. government and is committed to continuing to meet these obligations.\"</p>", "<p>Rice's withdrawal will make it easier for Secretary of State Clinton, who is due to testify about the Benghazi episode next week on Capitol Hill, but Senator Graham said Rice's withdrawal is not the end of the controversy. Graham told me tonight the administration \"is still inexplicably stonewalling and we still want answers.\" </p>"], "article_author": ["Lucy Madison"]}

I just think, given the fight that we're in, it's irresponsible. This is why the president, frankly, should withdraw the authorization of use of military force and start over,\" Boehner told reporters.</p>", "<p>Boehner has argued for months that the administration doesn't have a strategy to fight the Islamic militants. And there's a divide between Democrats and Republicans: liberal members are wary of an open-ended commitment that gives the president, both present and future, the broad ability to wage war. Republicans, meanwhile, think the president needs broader authority than he has asked for to defeat ISIS. </p>", "<p>But for some lawmakers, those objections don't justify Congress' inaction.</p>", "<p>\"I think we're at risk of losing our institutional power to authorize and conduct war, so the stakes here constitutionally are much greater than the issue itself,\" Rep. Tom Cole, R-Oklahoma, an advocate of passing an AUMF, told CBS News. Cole said he agrees with Boehner that Obama needs a more coherent strategy, but he believes that Congress will be better equipped to push for changes in the strategy once they give the president formal authorization for the war against ISIS.</p>", "<p>\"I'm not critical of the speaker and I would like a different kind of resolution, but I think the best way to get there is to simply start acting,\" he said.</p>", "<p>Cole joined Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, in writing a letter to Boehner last month urging him to bring the AUMF up for debate and a vote. Just 28 of their colleagues in the House signed on.</p>", "<p>\"I think many lawmakers don't think there's anything to be gained and a lot to be risked by voting for a war authorization measure, particularly a war as messy as this one,\" Schiff told CBS News. \"There's a great deal of apathy when it comes to fulfilling our constitutional responsibility of either declaring war or refusing to authorize a war.\"</p>", "<p>Both Cole and Schiff say it was problematic that the administration has always taken the position that it wants but does not need the AUMF to fight the Islamic State. From the time airstrikes began in August 2014, White House officials have said that old use of force resolutions from 2001 and 2002 - which were designed to carry out both the fight against al Qaeda and the war in Iraq - give the president the legal authority he needs.</p>", "<p>\"Once you start the process the wrong way, the idea that anybody wants to step up once you're in it, they wonder, 'well is it simply an academic exercise? Am I running a political risk for something that doesn't matter anyway?'\" Cole said. Schiff said he believes the White House, is \"reluctant to use a lot of its capital to advance something doesn't believe legally it needs.\"</p>", "<p>But ISIS has been making inroads. It drove the U.S.-trained Iraqi military out of Ramadi, a city 70 miles west of Baghdad, on Sunday, while  the debate over war authorization remained mired in a round of finger-pointing and uncertainty about what happens next.</p>", "<p>\"He's the speaker of the house and he's blaming the president for something not moving through Congress,\" White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters Tuesday after Boehner called for new legislation. Earnest argued that the White House not only crafted the language at Boehner's demands, but had \"dozens of conversations and at least a dozen meetings\" with members of Congress during the fall and winter as they crafted the proposal.</p>", "<p> \"The fact is that it's the responsibility of Congress to send a clear signal to the world, to our enemies and to our men and women in uniform that the United States Congress is committed to the effort to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL,\" Earnest said. \"When it comes to making their voice heard and fulfilling their constitutional responsibility to do that, Congress and their leadership in both parties has been AWOL.\"</p>", "<p>Despite their belief that Congress will face long-term consequences for inaction, neither Cole nor Schiff sounds optimistic about the prospect for movement. Cole suggested it might take a lot of angry constituents to get things moving. Schiff said the House Foreign Affairs or Senate Foreign Relations committees would need to start moving legislation themselves - or there would need to be \"a change of heart in the Speaker's office.\"</p>", "<p>House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce echoed Boehner, saying in a statement, \"We still need more information from the Administration.\" The top Democrat, Rep. Eliot Engel, agreed that the legislation must go through that committee - but that first, \"we've got to hear from the speaker.\"</p>", "<p>He argued Boehner's comments were helpful because they thrust the discussion about military authorization back into the spotlight. And though Engel said Congress should strike a balance between giving Mr. Obama and future presidents a blank check and tying their hands, he also suggested the issue needs more time to evolve.</p>", "<p>Asked why the Foreign Affairs Committee hadn't started to debate the AUMF sooner, Engel said, \"I think we weren't ready for it. Before you can just do a markup and throw an idea out and see what develops, you've got to figure out what you want.\"</p>", "<p>Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Virginia, said the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee could be more fertile ground, especially after it managed to craft the the Iran Nuclear Review Act into a bill that drew broad bipartisan support. </p>", "<p>\"The pressure is on us, starting in Foreign Relations, to try to do something bipartisan, and hopefully have that pick up momentum on the Senate floor,\" he told CBS News.</p>", "<p>Kaine said that the committee's chairman, Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tennessee, and top Democrat, Maryland Sen. Ben Cardin, are both \"very interested\" in finding a way to write an AUMF that has bipartisan support. </p>", "<p>Corker also warned at a Christian Science Monitor breakfast last week that, \"What I don't want to do is go through a process that indicates to the rest of the world that somehow the United States is somehow divided on the issue of dealing [ISIS]. I don't want to do that. I don't think that is a good thing for our country.\"</p>", "<p>\"On the other hand, I understand that if there is a path forward, where you can complete the process successfully, it is something worthy of pursuing,\" he said. But it would require resolving the tensions between Democrats who want to limit the authority of a future president and Republicans who believe that supporting the current AUMF is tantamount to \"embracing a non-strategy in Syria.\"</p>", "<p>It's not an easy path, Kaine acknowledges.</p>", "<p>\"I think Congress is afraid to cast hard votes and there's no harder vote than a vote on war,\" he said.</p>"], "article_author": ["Rebecca Kaplan"]}

And these voter divisions may be mirrored in at least one key primary state, not just nationwide. (It might not have precluded the current debate, but those divisions are one reason reforms may have stalled in Congress, too.)</p>", "<p>Recent CBS News polling shows the kind of breakdown on immigration policy we've routinely found for years, with just under half of Republicans saying undocumented immigrants should be required to leave. Another half are okay with some form of legalization, including just over a third of Republicans who would back a path to citizenship.</p>", "<p>Those divisions make Republican voters hard to please, too: a recent <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2015/06/04/broad-public-support-for-legal-status-for-undocumented-immigrants/\">Pew study</a> showed the party's rank-and-file critical of their own party's handing of the issue, and recent <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/poll-the-2016-presidential-race/\">CBS News polls</a> shows many GOP voters feel the issue could be a dealbreaker for a candidate: they wouldn't consider voting for someone who disagreed with them.

The <a href=\"http://goproject.gop.com/RNC_Growth_Opportunity_Book_2013.pdf\">post-election report</a> the GOP conducted for itself after the last presidential race directly addressed both rhetoric and policy on the issue, saying that if Hispanic Americans believed the GOP's nominee simply \"does not want them in the United States\" then they were not going to listen to their \"next sentence\" about economic opportunity or anything else.

Lead researcher Dr. Leonardo Trasande, an associate professor in pediatrics and environmental medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center, told CBSNews.com that his study's findings lend support to efforts to get the chemical banned by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).</p>", "<p>BPA is a chemical used as protective linings in food packaging to prevent corrosion, and can leach into foods through packaging as well through tableware, food storage containers and plastic bottles. While BPA can be found in air and dust, according to Trasande, previous studies suggest 99 percent of BPA exposure in young children comes from their diets.<br></p>", "<p>That's problematic because the chemicals have been tied to hormone-disrupting effects, including reproductive and neurological effects, and the researchers say children at a young age may be more prone to changes.The body excretes BPA through urination, but it can remain in fat deposits.</p>", "<p>For the study, researchers examined the association between amounts of BPA in the bodies of more than 2,800 children and adolescents between ages 6 and 19 - as tested by urinary analysis - and body mass index (BMI), a measure for obesity. The children were part of the 2003-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) that measures children's behaviors and how it relates to their health. </p>", "<p> Based on results from urine tests, the researchers divided the study participants into four groups, from lowest BPA exposure to the highest. After mathematically controlling for other contributing factors such as television viewing habits, caloric intake and socioeconomic status, the researchers found that only 10 percent of kids exposed to the lowest levels of BPA were obese, compared to more than 22 percent of kids who were exposed to the most BPA - a two-fold increase. Differences between the other groups were not statistically significant.</p>", "<p>Trasande added that further analysis revealed the effect was only seen in white children and adolescents and not in Hispanic and black children studied, for unknown reasons. He also said his research found obesity was not linked to similar \"phenol\" chemicals used in sunscreens and soaps, such as triclosan.</p>", "<p>Trasande noted that the study does not prove cause and effect and it may be that some factor of obesity causes children to store more BPA rather than the opposite. He said further studies that track children and adolescents for long periods of time are needed to provide additional answers to the role of BPA in causing obesity.</p>", "<p>Linda Birnbaum, director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, who was not involved in the new study, told the<a href=\"http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_MED_OBESE_KIDS_BPA?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;CTIME=2012-09-18-11-01-52\"> Associated Press</a> that the study raises some interesting questions but it's impossible to say BPA causes childhood obesity.<br></p>", "<p>\"It's a hypothesis that needs further exploration,\" she said.</p>", "<p>Trasande said that based on his findings, it's too early to make clinical recommendations on certain foods to avoid, but did say aluminum canned food is one of the biggest sources of BPA in the food supply and fresh vegetables should be part of a healthy diet.</p>", "<p>\"BPA does not discriminate by can,\" he said.<br></p>", "<p>He did however add that the findings lend support to intervention strategies, such as banning BPA from the lining of food packaging.</p>", "<p>This past March, the <span class=\"link\"><a href=\"/news/fda-rejects-petition-to-ban-bpa-in-food-packaging\">FDA rejected a petition</a></span>calling for the ban of BPA in all food and drink packaging. </p>", "<p>\"While evidence from some studies have raised questions as to whether BPA may be associated with a variety of health effects, there remain serious questions about these studies, particularly as they relate to humans,\" the agency said in its response at the time.<br></p>", "<p> In July the FDA decided to formally ban BPA from <span class=\"link\"><a href=\"/news/fda-bans-bpa-from-baby-bottles-sippy-cups\">baby bottles and sippy cups</a></span>, which many companies had already been phasing out from their products after reported health risks.

The additions to Android would help companies integrate use of sensors, data recording and healthcare history to provide mobile apps that could likely also tie into the healthcare ecosystem.</p>", "<p>In some ways, the push by Google and Apple into the health sector is a natural one. The clinical <a href=\"http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/clinical-data-analytics-get-red-hot\">health care data analytics market</a> is seeing huge growth. That is being driven both by the Affordable Care Act, which has significant incentives to move medicine toward interconnected electronic communications, and spiraling health care costs. </p>", "<p>Until recently, much of the health car industry has functioned like a collection of cottage businesses run that continue to rely on outdated manual processes and that are unable to effectively exchange information.

By law, providers are required to keep strict control over personal health information. The Department of Health and Human Services has shown a growing willingness to impose hefty fines on providers hit with data breaches or that otherwise fail to safeguard patient records. </p>", "<p>Although such sums might be trivial for a Google or Apple, they represent large sums for most health care organizations. And tech companies face hits to their reputation, and perhaps legal liability, if their gear is involved in a leak of patient data.</p>", "<p>Of course, issues of privacy and regulatory compliance are common in tech, too. Apple has a reasonably good record of securing customer information. But the company's Internet \"cloud\" services have had their problems, including outages that would be considered problematic in a health care setting, and criminals hacking into user accounts. In addition, the company would have to change its existing business processes that have served it well so it could easily share data with health care providers. That also could pose risks. </p>", "<p>Google is experienced at sharing data and at running high volume cloud services. But their software, systems and devices have been targets for hackers.

In December the FDA said it will rule on BPA use in food by the end of March, <span class=\"link\"><a href=\"/news/fda-to-decide-on-bpa-use-in-food-packaging-by-march-31\">HealthPop</a></span> reported.<br></p>", "<p>About 90 percent of Americans have traces of BPA in their bodies, mainly because it leaches out of bottles, canned food and other food containers.</p>", "<p>A <span class=\"link\"><a href=\"/news/bpa-levels-soar-after-eating-canned-soup-study\">study last November</a></span> found people who eat a serving of canned soup for five consecutive days could raise their urinary BPA levels by a whopping 1,000 percent.<br></p>", "<p>Some scientists believe exposure to BPA can harm the reproductive and nervous systems, particularly in babies and small children, potentially leading to cancer and other diseases. They point to results from dozens of BPA studies in rodents and other animals.</p>", "<p>But FDA reiterated in its response that that those findings cannot be applied to humans. The agency said the studies cited by NRDC were often too small to be conclusive. In other cases they involved researchers injecting BPA into animals, whereas humans ingest the chemical through their diet over longer periods of time. The agency also said that humans digest and eliminate BPA much more quickly than rats and other lab animals.</p>", "<p>\"While evidence from some studies have raised questions as to whether BPA may be associated with a variety of health effects, there remain serious questions about these studies, particularly as they relate to humans,\" the agency said in its response.</p>", "<p>The agency's official position is that there is \"some concern\" about BPA's effects on young children. The government is spending $30 million to conduct additional studies on the chemical's impact on humans. Several federal studies published in the last two years suggest that even human embryos retain far less BPA than other animals.</p>", "<p>Last October, <span class=\"link\"><a href=\"/news/bpa-tied-to-behavior-problems-in-girls-but-how-about-boys\">a study</a></span>of pregnant women found BPA exposure while in the womb may disrupt fetal brain development, leading to behavior problems in young girls.<br></p>", "<p>Many companies have already responded to consumer demand by removing BPA from their products. In 2008, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Toys \"R\" Us said they began phasing out bottles, sippy cups and other children's items containing BPA. By the end of 2009, the six leading makers of baby bottles in the U.S. went BPA-free. Earlier this month Campbell's Soup said it would begin removing BPA from its most popular soups, though it did not set a time frame. </p>", "<p>But the vast majority of canned goods in the U.S. are still sealed with resin that contains BPA to prevent contamination and spoiling. Canned food manufacturers have used the chemicals since the 1950s, and the practice is approved by the FDA. The chemical industry says BPA is the safest, most effective sealant.</p>", "<p>Some manufacturers have begun switching to alternatives. Heinz reportedly uses BPA-free coatings for its Nurture baby formula cans, and ConAgra and General Mills say they have switched to alternative sealants for some canned tomatoes.</p>", "<p>The federal government has been grappling with the safety of BPA for more than four years. The FDA revised its opinion on BPA in 2010 saying there is \"some concern\" about the chemical's impact on the brain and reproductive system of infants, babies and young children. Previously the agency said the trace amounts of BPA that leach out of food containers are not dangerous.</p>", "<p>While older children and adults quickly eliminate the chemical through their kidneys, newborns and infants can retain it for longer. Scientists pushing for a ban on the chemical argue that BPA mimics the effects of the hormone estrogen, interfering with growth.</p>"], "article_author": ["CBS News Staff"]}

The bipartisan legislation the House passed today is the only way Congress will have that opportunity.\"</p>", "<p>Getting a deal would enhance Obama's foreign policy record, and while the GOP-led Congress doesn't want to see a nuclear-armed Iran, they are skeptical about Iranian compliance and have demanded time to review the fine points of any agreement the White House reaches with Tehran.</p>", "<p>Presidential spokesman Josh Earnest said again Thursday that Obama would sign the bill into law.</p>", "<p>Negotiators from the U.S. and five other nations are <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/obama-strikes-cautious-tone-in-selling-iran-nuclear-deal/\">rushing to reach a deal</a> with Tehran by the end of June. As the House voted, <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-does-obamas-use-of-camp-david-compare-to-past-presidents/\">Obama met at the Camp David presidential retreat</a> in Maryland with Arab leaders in hopes of convincing them that U.S. overtures to Iran would not come at the expense of commitments to their security in the region.</p>", "<p>The Iran nuclear legislation would bar Obama from waiving congressional sanctions for at least 30 days while lawmakers examine any final deal. The bill would stipulate that if senators disapprove of the deal, Obama would lose his current power to waive certain economic penalties Congress has imposed on Iran.</p>", "<p>The bill, which was passed last week by the Senate on a 98-1 vote, would require Congress to pass a resolution of disapproval to reject the deal, an action that Obama almost certainly would veto. Congress then would have to muster votes from two-thirds of each chamber to override the veto.</p>", "<p>Even if Congress rejects his final nuclear deal with Tehran, however, Obama could use his executive pen to offer a hefty portion of sanctions relief on his own. He could take unilateral actions that - when coupled with European and U.N. sanctions relief - would allow a deal to be implemented.</p>", "<p>Rep. Ed Royce, R-Calif., chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, backed the measure, saying it would strengthen the U.S. negotiating position with Tehran.</p>", "<p>\"Instead of Iranian negotiators knowing that they can wear down the administration, this now injects Congress as an important backstop,\" Royce said.</p>", "<p>New York Rep. Eliot Engel, ranking Democrat on the panel, urged bipartisan passage, saying, \"Let's get this bill to the president's desk with a single voice.\"</p>", "<p>At the same time, he lamented that the nuclear talks were not addressing Iran's threat to destroy Israel, Americans being held captive in the country, Iran's backing of militant groups and its involvement in Iraq, Yemen and Syria.</p>", "<p>Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minn., said he opposed the bill because it wasn't needed. He said Congress already has the authority to lift or retain the sanctions Congress has levied against Iran. \"We have the cards. We do not have to choke this deal in the crib,\" Ellison said.</p>", "<p>Also Thursday, the House considered a defense policy bill that authorizes U.S. military spending, with a final vote expected Friday. Obama has threatened to veto the House bill, which historically has garnered overwhelming bipartisan support.</p>", "<p>House Speaker John Boehner chided Democrats for pulling their support for the bill.</p>", "<p>\"I think it's downright shameful that they are even contemplating turning back on the American troops, especially those (Democrats) on the Armed Services Committee who voted for this bill in committee.\"</p>", "<p>House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi's office quickly responded, saying Boehner was among 160 Republicans who voted against the defense authorization bill in 2010. That was the year that the repeal of \"don't ask, don't tell\" - the law that barred gay, lesbian and bisexual individuals from openly serving in the military - was added to the bill, known as the National Defense Authorization Act.</p>", "<p>\"Regardless of whether we support the NDAA or not, we all support the brave men and women of our military who defend this country,\" said Washington Rep. Adam Smith, the ranking Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee. \"Speaker Boehner is only implying otherwise in order to score cheap partisan points. Shame on him.\"</p>", "<p>Overall, the House bill authorizes $515 billion in spending for national defense and another $89.2 billion for the emergency war-fighting fund for a total of $604.2 billion. Another $7.7 billion is mandatory defense spending that doesn't get authorized by Congress. That means the bill would provide the entire $611.9 billion desired by the president, but he still has threatened to veto it.</p>", "<p>He and Democratic lawmakers oppose the way the committee skirted automatic spending caps imposed by Congress in 2011 by increasing defense spending by padding the emergency war-fighting fund, which is not affected by the caps. Democrats argue that the GOP wants to ignore those spending caps when it comes to funding the military, but wants to adhere to them when it comes to other domestic spending.</p>", "<p>The same approach to authorizing defense spending was taken Thursday on the Senate side, and garnered the same opposition from Democrats.</p>", "<p>The Senate Armed Services Committee voted 22-4 to authorize $523 billion in base funding for the Defense Department and the national security programs of the Energy Department as well as an additional $90.2 billion for the emergency war-fighting fund.</p>", "<p>Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., the committee chairman, said the measure also included bipartisan language requiring Obama to submit a detailed proposal to Congress on his plan to close the U.S. prison for terror suspect at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and transfer them to U.S. detention facilities. That plan would only take effect if approved by Congress, he said.</p>", "<p>The measure would also authorize $300 million for the Ukraine government to buy weapons and equipment for its war against pro-Russian separatists.</p>", "<p><em>CBS News' Walt Cronkite contributed to this report.</em></p>"], "article_author": ["May 14, 2015, 5:18 PM"]}

The additions to Android would help companies integrate use of sensors, data recording and healthcare history to provide mobile apps that could likely also tie into the healthcare ecosystem.</p>", "<p>In some ways, the push by Google and Apple into the health sector is a natural one. The clinical <a href=\"http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/clinical-data-analytics-get-red-hot\">health care data analytics market</a> is seeing huge growth. That is being driven both by the Affordable Care Act, which has significant incentives to move medicine toward interconnected electronic communications, and spiraling health care costs. </p>", "<p>Until recently, much of the health car industry has functioned like a collection of cottage businesses run that continue to rely on outdated manual processes and that are unable to effectively exchange information.

The Department of Health and Human Services has shown a growing willingness to impose hefty fines on providers hit with data breaches or that otherwise fail to safeguard patient records. </p>", "<p>Although such sums might be trivial for a Google or Apple, they represent large sums for most health care organizations. And tech companies face hits to their reputation, and perhaps legal liability, if their gear is involved in a leak of patient data.</p>", "<p>Of course, issues of privacy and regulatory compliance are common in tech, too. Apple has a reasonably good record of securing customer information. But the company's Internet \"cloud\" services have had their problems, including outages that would be considered problematic in a health care setting, and criminals hacking into user accounts. In addition, the company would have to change its existing business processes that have served it well so it could easily share data with health care providers. That also could pose risks. </p>", "<p>Google is experienced at sharing data and at running high volume cloud services. But their software, systems and devices have been targets for hackers.

One woman remained seated for a very personal reason: she has a family member who was a POW in Vietnam. She did not feel comfortable sharing her name, but she found Trump's comments completely inappropriate and added that they should \"disqualify\" him from the presidential race.</p>", "<p>On Sunday, Luntz echoed these sentiments in his analysis on CBS' Face the Nation.</p>", "<p>\"This is a big deal because it demonstrates character. It demonstrates judgment,\" the pollster explained. \"Up until this point, that exchange was because I was asking him questions about the words that he was using and whether they were proper for a presidential candidate.

Conservative journalists Bill Kristol said \"I'm finished with Donald Trump,\" and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry went as far as to say, \"I don't think he has the character or the temperament to hold the highest position in this country.\"</p>", "<p>But when all was said and done on Saturday evening - after the long eight-and-a-half-hour-day, the eyes of the Iowans inside the auditorium had glazed over.

More than 2,500 attended the event and, in typical Iowan fashion, many left, saying that they are still shopping for a candidate to win their heart and their vote.

A communications system would allow the software to work with third party devices, critical because Apple does not produce most of these product types.</p>", "<p>Another patent application, first filed in 2007 and made public in 2011, suggested that the company wanted to <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/apples-latest-vision-relax-well-run-your-life-for-you/\" target=\"_blank\">run the lives of its customers</a>, with the eventual availability of \"fitness, nutrition, and/or medical modules,\" according to the filing.</p>", "<p>Some see this as an answer to Google's interest in home automation -- shown by its $3.2 billion acquisition of Nest Labs, which makes smart thermostats, smoke detectors, and carbon dioxide detectors -- and <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/04/samsung-launches-smart-home-android-app-and-two-compatible-appliances/\" target=\"_blank\">Samsung's connected appliances</a> and Android smartphone software.</p>", "<p>But Apple's long interest in the subject, as demonstrated by patent activity, shows that this is no recent reaction to competitors. The company's goal for many years has been to insinuate itself into consumers' lives. Although home automation systems for technology do-it-yourselfers have existed for decades, only recently, with the growing power of wireless computing and communications, has the concept has become accessible to a broader range of consumers.

And thus, some say, rescue the <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/trade-slowdown-points-to-world-recession-risk-watchdog-says/\">troubled global economy</a>. But it's a stretch to think that Beijing's plan -- shifting the export-driven country from emphasizing manufacturing and infrastructure to relying on public consumption - will spread sweet prosperity over the face of the earth.</p>", "<p>Optimism about Chinese consumers remains rife in some quarters, even after this <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/markets-stumble-as-china-devalues/\">summer's devaluation</a> of China's currency, a tanking stock market and slowing economic growth. Goldman Sachs predicted in a <a href=\"http://www.goldmansachs.com/our-thinking/interconnected-markets/growth-of-china/chinese-consumer/index.html\">recent report</a> that China's flourishing middle class and their hearty spending will buoy its economy and benefit the wider world. A <a href=\"http://www.mckinseychina.com/why-im-still-bullish-on-the-chinese-economy/\">McKinsey &amp; Co.</a> analysis struck a similarly bullish note.</p>", "<p>The irony is that the world's second-largest economic power is largely to blame for squelching international growth in the first place. China's economic slowdown, <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/chinas-economic-growth-declines-to-6-year-low/\">to 6.9 percent in the third quarter</a> from double-digits not long ago, has reverberated far and wide.</p>", "<p>Citigroup sees a <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-09/citigroup-sees-55-risk-of-a-global-recession-made-in-china\">55 percent chance of a worldwide recession</a> within the next two years, chiefly courtesy of China's slowdown. Commodity producers like Brazil have suffered as Chinese demand for its materials has flagged. Developed nations like Germany, which exports a lot of machinery to China, also feel the impact. Bad news out of China also typically shakes stock markets from New York to Tokyo.</p>", "<p>Certainly, China's deceleration from decades of torrid expansion is to be expected. After all, the U.S. (still the No. 1 economy) followed the same pattern of pell-mell gains from the late 1800s through the past century, only to see it taper off. Since the 2008 financial crisis, the U.S. economy has nudged up by only 2 percent or so annually. At least America's growth is better than that of many other nations. (The U.S. economy was $17.4 trillion last year, compared with $10.4 trillion for China, the <a href=\"http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD\">World Bank</a> says.)</p>", "<p>Of course, tepid growth satisfies no one, and prompts politicians to call for rejuvenation schemes, some rather dubious. Just as several American presidential candidates claim they can rev up economic output through tax cuts, Chinese leaders say they have their own key to improving the nation's performance. Enter their chosen savior: the consumer.</p>", "<p>Specifically, Beijing says, the answer is to bolster people's spending, which will have a salutary and permanent ripple effect on its economy.</p>", "<p>\"Despite a slowdown in the industrial sector, China's services sector is growing rapidly,\" said <a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/257ba831b5c248a792588793c8083e29/chinas-economy-expanded-69-percent-third-quarter\">Sheng Laiyun</a>, a spokesman for the Chinese statistics agency, announcing the latest downshift in gross domestic product. The new 6.9 percent growth rate marked a six-year low.</p>", "<p>\"We will continue to increase household consumption and make sure that greater internal demand could serve as a new power to drive economic growth,\" Premier Li Keqiang told a global economic forum last year.</p>", "<p>Among <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/20/business/as-growth-slows-china-pins-hopes-on-consumer-spending.html?_r=0\">government plans</a> to kick-start the process: debuting a nationwide pension system, offering universal medical insurance and alleviating some taxes for businesses. It is encouraging banks to pay depositors more on their savings, and to help smaller companies, letting nonbank lenders offer financing. Last month, Beijing cut the tax on purchases.</p>", "<p>The idea is that an economy more reliant on consumers is more stable than one that churns out goods for sale to foreign buyers whose fortunes fluctuate. Plus, the thinking goes, a consumer-centered economy may be less prone to constructing enormous boondoggles like China's high-speed rail project and its millions of vacant apartments.</p>", "<p>Without a doubt, Chinese consumer spending has gotten bigger thanks to the nation's economic ascension (In 2011 it overtook Japan for second place in the world GDP ranking.) <a href=\"http://www.ibtimes.com/china-retail-sales-11-highest-rise-year-2179198\">Retail sales</a> advanced 11 percent in October, the fastest increase this year, government statisticians reported. The recent <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/china-singles-day-alibaba-jd-com-breaks-record-number-of-sales/\">SinglesDay</a>, a shopping spree event akin the U.S.'s Black Friday, enjoyed huge sales. </p>", "<p>Although China is nominally communist, the roster of its mega-rich has burgeoned and generated tales reminiscent of America's Gilded Age. This past week, Chinese billionaire Liu Yiqian <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/modigliani-nude-painting-fetches-record-170-4m-in-n-y/\">paid $170 million</a> for a 1918 painting by Amedeo Modigliani.</p>", "<p>But these signs of success are overwhelmed by a daunting structural weakness: China's overall consumer spending is quite small. Getting anywhere near the level of developed nations like the U.S. and Britain, where consumers dominate economic life, will be tough. </p>", "<p>A report from the <a href=\"https://www.conference-board.org/press/pressdetail.cfm?pressid=5512\">Demand Institute</a>, a branch of New York-based think tank The Conference Board, concluded: \"While Chinese consumer spending has grown in absolute terms, consumption as a share of GDP has steadily declined for six decades.\"</p>", "<p>By the group's reckoning, consumer activity in China now stands at a mere 28 percent of the economy, versus over 70 percent in the U.S. Although others place China's consumer share higher, using different measurements, the figure is undeniably on the low end in rankings such as that from the <a href=\"http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NE.CON.PETC.ZS\">World Bank</a>.</p>", "<p>In addition, the government effort to produce a consumer-tilted culture faces several powerful headwinds:</p>", "<p><strong>The Chinese savings ethic is sacrosanct. </strong>In China, the public saves a towering 30 percent of disposable income. Compare that with the U.S. savings figure, 5 percent. It's axiomatic: If you hold onto more of your money, then you spend less. Yes, China's new urban professional class may open their wallets like Americans. For a lot of Chinese, however, the old habits of thrift will he hard to shuck.</p>", "<p><strong>Many Chinese are poor.</strong> In fact, one out of 10 of them are in poverty, which is concentrated in the rural areas. Rural dwellers earn an average $1 per day. Obviously, that's a lot of people who can't contribute much to boosting the consumer economy. The government has shown, on the other hand, that throwing money at this problem can help. As migrants crowded the cities, looking for work, Beijing paid them subsidies, an act that slashed urban poverty. </p>", "<p><strong>The population is aging.</strong> While one of China's strengths is a large population -- at 1.37 billion, it is the most populous country on earth -- the working-age citizenry is shrinking. A society increasingly skewed toward the elderly is an obstacle for the ambitious plans to hike consumption. </p>", "<p>The reason: Older folks tend to spend less than the young. Now, 10 percent of Chinese are over 65, a figure that is estimated to reach 15 percent in 2017 and 20 percent in 2035. </p>", "<p>The situation largely stems from the draconian policy, instituted in the late 1970s, limiting couples to one child. The government <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/china-communist-party-to-abolish-one-child-policy/\">rescinded this rule</a> last month, but no one expects that a baby boom is about to explode, since old habits are hard to overcome. Besides, even if births did resume at a normal pace, relative to other places, changing the nation's demographics would take a generation at the minimum. </p>", "<p>For sure, at some point China will arrive at a consumer-centric economy, much as the U.S. has. Such a day, though, is a long way off. And the result is that, for the foreseeable future China won't be igniting a second-stage booster rocket to send the rest of the world skyward.</p>"], "article_author": ["  Larry Light"]}

That's a primary reason shares of Amazon have risen 117 percent so far this year, outperforming other tech heavyweights such as Google' parent Alphabet (<a href=\"http://markets.cbsnews.com/GOOG/quote/\">GOOG</a>), which have gained 45 percent, and Apple (<a href=\"http://markets.cbsnews.com/AAPL/quote/\">AAPL</a>), which fell 3 percent.</p>", "<p> \tFor 2016, trends are expected to remain positive for Amazon.</p>", "<p> \tAccording to <a href=\"https://www.forrester.com/Forrester+Research+eCommerce+Forecast+2014+To+2019+US/fulltext/-/E-res116713\" target=\"_blank\">Forrester Research</a>, e-commerce spending should hit $334 billion in 2015 and increase at a compound annual growth rate of 10 percent during the next five years, reaching $480 billion.</p>", "<p> \t Amazon also is benefiting from the strength of its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud business, which saw revenue grow 78 percent to $2.1 billion in the third quarter.  Operating income at AWS surged to $521 million, compared with $98 million during the year-earlier period.  One reason AWS has been a bright spot is that it has more than four times the computing capacity than the next 14 largest providers combined.</p>", "<p> \t\"Between AWS (and) increased prime memberships and increased third-party sales,  I think the fourth quarter is shaping up not only to be a record sales quarter for the company but also a strong profitability quarter,\" said R.J.  Hottovy, an analyst with Morningstar, in an interview.  \"It seems that the narrative that this company can't turn a profit is starting to fade a bit.\"</p>", "<p> \tAmazon has proven to be challenging company for Wall Street analysts to cover because it's unpredictable and offers vague financial guidance. For instance, it's forecasting fourth-quarter operating income to be between $80 million and $1.28 billion.  This leaves plenty of room for error for the company's most important quarter.</p>", "<p> \t\"You can drive a truck through their fourth-quarter operating income range,\" Hottovy said, adding that Amazon's results have exceeded analysts' expectations for the previous two holiday periods and should be able to do the same this year.</p>", "<p> \tAmazon, though, is also a big spender, which has hampered its profitability over the years.   Selling, general and administrative expenses skyrocketed more than 313 percent to <a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amzn/financials\" target=\"_blank\">$25.37 billion in 2014 compared with $6.13 billion in 2010</a>. During that time overall revenue surged to $88.9 billion from $34.2 billion, a gain of more than 161 percent.</p>", "<p> \tHowever, Amazon has reported net income of more than $100 million in only one of the past five quarters and reported losses in two of them.</p>", "<p> \t\"We think some investors are still hesitant that Amazon could reenter a heavy investment phase (possibly to expand same-day delivery services), which could pressure margins again. But we think investments in automation and robotics, as well as an apparent stabilization in pricing at AWS, should be a positive for margins at least through the first half of next year,\" wrote Vogel. He rates the company's shares as \"outperform.\"</p>"], "article_author": ["Jonathan Berr"]}

It's hard to say why he is still such an unknown commodity among the public: O'Malley, one of the most liberal governors in the country, chaired the Democratic Governors' Association for two years, makes rounds on the Sunday shows, has spent months crisscrossing the country to help other Democrats get elected, and was even, to some extent, the inspiration for a character in HBO's \"The Wire.\"</p>", "<p>But the auditions for alternatives to Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primary are still wide open, and  O'Malley is determined to get a hearing. He's out reminding Democrats that they have an unabashedly liberal choice -- with the record to back it up.</p>", "<p>Democratic politics run in O'Malley's blood -- his parents met while working on a newsletter for young Democrats. His own start in the business came in 1982, as an aide in Gary Hart's presidential campaign. O'Malley even took a semester off from Catholic University in 1983 to work for the campaign in Iowa. </p>", "<p>He worked for Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Maryland while he was still in law school and then briefly became a state's attorney for the city of Baltimore. After a failed bid for state senate in 1990, O'Malley was elected to the Baltimore City Council in 1991. </p>", "<p>In 1999, O'Malley was elected mayor of Baltimore - the only white candidate in a majority-black city. In that position, he began to develop his own political identity, embracing the wonky ways of a technocrat to tackle the city's problems. He implemented a program called CitiState to help gather and analyze data, leading to better government performance and a sharp reduction in violent crime. </p>", "<p>\"I brought forward a new way of governing and a new way of getting things done,\" he tells voters about his tenure as Baltimore mayor. \"I started setting goals with deadlines. Instead of simply counting inputs, my team started measuring outputs and managing for results.\"</p>", "<p>O'Malley used the same approach on the state level when he was elected governor of Maryland in 2006, ousting Bob Ehrlich, the incumbent Republican governor (the Clintons endorsed him that year; he returned the favor by endorsing Hillary Clinton in 2008).</p>", "<p>O'Malley had a strong enough first term that he handily dispatched Ehrlich's attempt at a rematch in 2010, despite the Republican wave that netted the party five GOP gubernatorial seats across the country that year. It was during his second term that O'Malley stacked up a list of progressive accomplishments that would make any liberal Democrat jealous: ending the death penalty in Maryland, raising the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour, implementing stricter gun control laws, legalizing gay marriage and giving in-state tuition to the children of immigrants in the U.S. illegally. The latter two policies survived a statewide referendum in 2012. </p>", "<p>But his legacy could prove fragile. O'Malley's lieutenant governor, Anthony Brown, <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/governor-elect-larry-hogan-gop-should-heed-my-victory-in-maryland/\">lost his 2014 gubernatorial bid to Republican Larry Hogan</a>. And O'Malley's record wasn't perfect: among the stumbles during O'Malley's second term was a botched rollout of the state's healthcare exchange, not unlike the national rollout. Maryland officials <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/maryland-news/maryland-officials-were-warned-for-a-year-of-problems-with-online-health-insurance-site/2014/01/11/f094ad94-6a98-11e3-8b5b-a77187b716a3_story.html\">reportedly ignored more than a year of warnings</a> about problems with the development of the website, leading to massive crashes the day it opened (just four people were able to sign up in the first 24 hours).</p>", "<p><strong>Foreign policy</strong>: While it's not surprising that a governor would be more fluent in domestic policy than foreign policy, O'Malley is unusually reticent on almost everything outside U.S. borders. During a 2013 trip to the Middle East while he was governor, O'Malley <a href=\"http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/24/in-israel-omalley-talks-jobs-foreign-policy-and-of-course-2016/\">told a group of reporters</a> he had gathered, \"I'm sure all of you will ask me foreign policy questions...I respect your right to ask them, and I hope you'll respect my right to shy away from answering them.\" He called the Syrian government's use of chemical weapons - a major issue that summer - \"one of the great challenges,\" and deferred to the president on the wisdom of engaging in a military operation to stop Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, according to the New York Times.</p>", "<p>Nearly two years later, he remains cautious about weighing in on foreign policy. In February, when the White House sent Congress a request for authorization for the use of military force (AUMF) to fight the <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/isis/\">Islamic State of Iraq and Syria</a> (ISIS), <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/MartinOMalley/posts/10155278542735393\">O'Malley wrote on Facebook</a>, \"The new AUMF should address ISIS specifically, and mitigate any unintended consequences by including clear language on the use of ground troops and the length and terms of engagement.\"</p>", "<p><a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2015/03/13/a_lot_of_us_are_disappointed_and_angry_martin_o%E2%80%99malley_makes_his_case_to_salon/\">Speaking to Salon last month</a>, O'Malley answered a question about how he would have dealt with conflicts in Libya and Syria. He gave a broad answer: \"I think our most effective foreign policy is a foreign policy of constant engagement around the world, and deploying our considerable diplomatic power, and our economic power, in accordance with our principles.\" </p>", "<p>Pressed further on Libya and Syria, he replied, \"I don't know. I wasn't there at the time, and I didn't really bone up on the nuances of that to be able to discuss it with you today.\"</p>", "<p>He did promise that in the next several months he would give a number of policy speeches, \"almost certainly on national security and foreign policy.\" </p>", "<p><strong>Immigration</strong>: O'Malley agrees with many of the Obama administration policies, but there is some dissension on immigration, specifically on the <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/feature/immigration-crisis/\">unaccompanied minors from Central America</a> flooding across the southern border of the U.S. When the White House promised that many children would be sent back to their home countries, O'Malley told reporters that would send them \"back to certain death.\" That prompted what was reported as a frustrated call from a top Obama aide, plus a potential leak that O'Malley had rejected a Maryland site to house some of the children awaiting due process (O'Malley <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/omalley-hosts-50-faith-leaders-to-discuss-md-response-to-child-border-crossings/2014/07/21/fd941a6e-10f3-11e4-8936-26932bcfd6ed_story.html\">argued</a> that the proposed site was in an area not welcome to immigrants).</p>", "<p>He's been bringing that instance up on the stump these days. \"When refugee children arrive on our doorstop fleeing starvation and death gangs, we don't turn them away - we act like the generous, compassionate people we have always been,\" O'Malley told a group of Iowa Democrats last week.</p>", "<p>Latino advocates are sure to note O'Malley's support for in-state tuition rates for immigrants in the state illegally, a law that later survived a statewide referendum. He also signed a law that expands the ability of immigrants living in Maryland illegally to get drivers licenses.</p>", "<p><strong>Economic policy</strong>: So far, O'Malley has made the economy central to his pitch. He has <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/MartinOMalley/posts/10155195163090393\">said the \"biggest challenge\"</a> facing the country is making the economy work, and his Facebook page is peppered with criticism of Wall Street, support for equal pay and notes about the importance of fair overtime pay.</p>", "<p>In speeches and <a href=\"http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/opinion/columnists/caucus/2015/03/20/prevent-another-crash-reform-wall-street/25057735/\">op-eds</a>, he warns about the dangers of letting \"another Wall Street meltdown to rain down on hard-working families.\" He wants the largest banking institutions broken up and says the U.S. should reinstate the Glass-Steagall Act, which in 1933 separated commercial and investment banking. Those rules were later  repealed during the Clinton administration. There needs to be more accountability for both CEOs and banks themselves, O'Malley says. </p>", "<p>It's a populist message that could attract supporters of Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who has <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/elizabeth-warren-im-not-running-for-president/\">said she will not run for president in 2016</a>.</p>", "<p>During his time as governor Maryland, O'Malley raised the sales, gas and income taxes in part to help balance the budget. Hogan, Maryland's new Republican governor, relentlessly hammered Brown, O'Malley's lieutenant governor and preferred successor in the statehouse, over the tax increases.</p>", "<p><strong>Social issues</strong>: O'Malley is likely to bring up his support for same-sex marriage when he talks to voters. \"The dignity of every person tells us that the right to marry is not a state right, it is a human right,\" he said at a Democratic event in Polk County last week. It's not just a statement about his own position on the issue; it was a subtle jab at potential rivals that include Clinton, who in the past have said they supported same-sex marriage but that it should <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgIe2GKudYY\">remain a state issue</a>. Clinton has modified her stance, however, effective this week. Her campaign spokesperson, Adrienne Elrod, told Buzzfeed Wednesday, \"Hillary Clinton supports marriage equality and hopes the Supreme Court will come down on the side of same-sex couples being guaranteed that constitutional right.\"</p>", "<p>On abortion, O'Malley <a href=\"http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/bal-md.abortion05apr05-story.html\">officially bills himself as pro-choice</a> and has received an award from Planned Parenthood of Maryland, and he has a 100 percent rating from the Maryland chapter of NARAL, an organization that advocates for abortion rights. But unlike same-sex marriage, it's not an issue he's likely to bring up.</p>", "<p>In a <a href=\"http://catholicreview.org/article/life/omalley-touts-progressive-agenda-for-state\">2010 interview</a> with the Maryland Catholic Conference, he said, \"I believe that it is an issue that is best left to the individual conscience of women...and in the meantime, as a society, we should do those things that we can to advance the dignity of every human life.\"</p>", "<p>For inspiration, O'Malley may want to look to his neighbor from the north, former Republican Sen. Rick Santorum.</p>", "<p>Santorum, who <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/iowa-gop-santorum-won-the-iowa-caucuses/\">won the 2012 Iowa caucuses</a>, didn't even register in Republican polls in the year-long run-up. His support remained stubbornly in the single digits until two weeks before voters showed up to caucus. No poll had put him over 20 percent, and he ended up with about 25 percent.</p>", "<p>\"If you don't have high name identification its really hard to score well in any of these early polls, just ask Rick Santorum,\" Jeff Link, a veteran Iowa Democratic strategist, told CBS News. And, he added, John Edwards also ranked low before his second-place finish in the 2008 caucuses. \"You can get a relatively small activists enthused, but it's really hard to move poll numbers.\"</p>", "<p>O'Malley recently ranked sixth (dead last) in a <a href=\"http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/iowa-poll/2015/01/31/iowa-poll-hillary-clinton-big-lead/22660295/\">Des Moines Register poll</a> of  likely Democratic caucus goers. Just one percent said he was their first choice. He can take some comfort, however, from the fact that in this early stage, 78 percent said they didn't know enough about him to form an opinion. Nationally, CBS News' most recent <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/election-2016-who-would-you-consider-voting-for/\">poll</a> shows him with similar numbers - three percent would consider voting for him, while 80 percent still don't feel they know enough about him. </p>", "<p>For the time being, O'Malley seems likely to work hard to change that, showing up for crowds big and small.</p>", "<p>But the small crowds have been growing. Over 150 people packed a bar near Des Moines, to meet O'Malley last Thursday, and a few hundred more showed up for his address at the Polk County Democrats dinner the following night. \"Just these last couple visits I've talked to a bunch of people that have seen him and they like him,\" Link said. </p>", "<p>He's promoting his work in the governor's mansion recovering from the recession and boosting Maryland schools and businesses. And the heavy focus on issues of fairness and Wall Street reform will resonate with Iowa's traditionally populist Democratic Party. Just as Webb <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/could-jim-webb-pose-a-threat-to-hillary-clinton-in-2016/\">runs to Clinton's left on foreign policy issues</a>, O'Malley is poised to do the same with economic issues. </p>", "<p>What he doesn't have, however, is a field of candidates as unsettled as the one Santorum faced in 2012.</p>", "<p>\"The thing that helped Rick Santorum immensely was that all the other people who were sort of competing in the Republican side for that social conservative spot rose up and fell away,\" Hagle said. \"There aren't even any second tier candidates, only one first tier candidate, Clinton...what O'Malley really has to do is hope that there's a serious stumble on the part of Hillary Clinton.\"</p>", "<p>And given Clinton's dominance of the Democratic field (that Des Moines Register poll showed Clinton had an 84 percent favorability rating and was the first choice of 56 percent of likely caucus goers), O'Malley is going to have to figure out whether that Santorum strategy will be enough to move the numbers from her column to his. </p>"], "article_author": ["Rebecca Kaplan"]}

They had a rare moment of agreement with President Obama that Congress should pass legislation that would expedite passage of a massive free-trade bill with the Asia-Pacific region.</p>", "<p>The Senate will officially vote on whether to take up Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), which would give the president more negotiating power, requiring Congress to vote yes or no on the entire Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) when the president submits it to Congress. Lawmakers would forego the ability to change individual provisions. If the president isn't granted this authority, it will be far more difficult for him to make any progress on either TPP or the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP).</p>", "<p>It appeared to be smooth sailing for the legislation when it passed the Senate Finance Committee on a vote of 20 to 6 at the end of April. But Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, an ardent opponent of free-trade deals, is threatening to block the full Senate from taking up the bill - and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, won't get the 60 votes he needs if all 44 Democrats stick together.</p>", "<p>At first, Reid objected to taking up a trade bill before finishing work on a transportation bill that will fund the nation's highways and another measure dealing with reforms to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, both of which come with an expiration date within weeks. Now, he insists that TPA be packaged with three other bills: a customs bill that cracks down on Chinese currency manipulation, child labor, and unfair trading practices; Trade Adjustment Assistance, which compensates American workers adversely affected by trade deals; and the African Growth and Opportunity Act. </p>", "<p>\"I feel that if it's going to be fair, they have to be brought together in the one piece of legislation,\" Reid told reporters at a press conference last week. \"I'm not going to stand by and allow them to pass TPA and leave the others blowing in the breeze. That would be unfair.\"</p>", "<p>Democrats who support the trade agreement are more flexible than Reid is, but still want to see a way forward for the other three pieces of legislation. The top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden, wants a guarantee that all of the bills will become law, but has not said they have to be tied together. If McConnell makes no such guarantee, Wyden is likely to vote against beginning debate on TPA and take the other pro-free-trade Democrats with him.</p>", "<p>Meanwhile, Republicans could balk if all four pieces of legislation are packaged together. Conservatives are already wary of giving Mr. Obama the authority to craft a trade deal that cannot be amended by Congress. And Heritage Action, an outside conservative group, opposes the part of the bill that would compensate American workers adversely affected by trade deals. </p>", "<p>\"Heritage Action has always been a free trade organization, but free-market conservatives are understandably split on this president's request for fast track authority.  Including an egregiously ineffective welfare program in a bill intended to promote trade will only exacerbate the problem.  Conservatives should oppose any effort to combine these two bills,\" CEO Michael Needham said in a statement Monday.</p>", "<p>Then there's the White House, which has warned that the legislation to crack down on currency manipulation could undermine the deal and the independence of the Federal Reserve.</p>", "<p>Asked whether the president would veto a TPA bill that included a measure on currency provision, White House Spokesman Josh Earnest said, \"I'm not willing to make that commitment at this point.\"</p>", "<p>McConnell has not yet revealed how exactly he will proceed. But he's been unusually supportive of the president through trade negotiations, telling reporters last week, \"At the risk of having some of you literally faint, I want to compliment the president for the way he's handling the trade issue.\"</p>", "<p>That's just the Senate side, where passing the fast-track authority was supposed to be easy. If a TPA bill makes it to the House, it would face renewed opposition from wary conservatives and Democrats.</p>", "<p>\"We continue to be in the member outreach and education phase, and that will continue while the Senate moves first,\" House Ways and Means Committee Spokesman Brendan Buck said. \"We remain confident we will provide a strong number, but, as always, will need Democrats to deliver as well.\"</p>", "<p>But <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/democrats-free-trade-war/\">Democrats who oppose the Trans-Pacific Partnership</a> have spent months whipping up opposition to trade promotion authority. A senior Democratic aide said the number of House Democrats who support TPA is estimated at less than 20. </p>", "<p>Despite a vigorous campaign to build support for the bill by Ways and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, Politico <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2015/05/trade-bill-obama-debate-117797.html?hp=t3_r\">reports</a> that more than 60 House Republicans would vote against a fast-track bill.

But the way trade deals influence \r\ntobacco sales in this country is a big deal, and that\u2019s why Obama has \r\nBiden, Madigan, and Schneiderman on his case.</p>", "<p>The trio joined 39 other states\u2019 attorneys general in a <a href=\"http://insidetrade.com/index.php?option=com_user&amp;view=login&amp;return=aHR0cDovL2luc2lkZXRyYWRlLmNvbS9pd3BmaWxlLmh0bWw/ZmlsZT1qYW4yMDE0L3d0bzIwMTRfMDI0MWEucGRm\">letter</a>\r\n to U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman protesting emerging \r\nprovisions in the Trans-Pacific trade pact that they fear would exempt \r\nU.S. tobacco companies from complying with state tobacco laws and \r\nregulations.</p>", "<p>From\r\n the letter: \u201cExperience has shown that state and local laws and \r\nregulations may be challenged by tobacco companies that aggressively \r\nassert claims under bilateral and multilateral trade and investment \r\nagreements, either directly under investor-state provisions or \r\nindirectly by instigating and supporting actions by countries that are \r\nparties to such agreements.\u201d</p>", "<p>There\r\n is history here. A Canadian cigarette maker challenged tobacco laws in \r\n45 states under provisions of the North American Free Trade Agreement. \r\nThe state laws prevailed, but only after extensive and costly litigation\r\n (which drained state coffers). Indonesia successfully appealed to the \r\nWorld Trade Organization to lift the U.S. ban on clove cigarettes.</p>", "<p>The\r\n letter is as bipartisan as things come these days, signed by 24 \r\nDemocrats and 18 Republicans. Biden is the vice president\u2019s son, Madigan\r\n sat in the same row as Obama in the Illinois Legislature, and \r\nSchneiderman was Obama\u2019s State of the Union guest in 2012. This is not \r\nan Obamacare redux, but an assertion of state power against a federal \r\ngovernment that might sacrifice it on the altar of free trade. You might\r\n think this tobacco issue is the biggest trade disagreement between \r\nObama and party loyalists. Butt, no. Equally important are mounting \r\ncomplaints about the secretive nature of talks on TPP, a potential \r\nfree-trade zone uniting the U.S. with Canada, Mexico, Australia, Brunei,\r\n Chile, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, and Vietnam.</p>", "<p>This week, Richard Trumka, head of the AFL-CIO, <a href=\"http://insidetrade.com/index.php?option=com_user&amp;view=login&amp;return=aHR0cDovL2luc2lkZXRyYWRlLmNvbS9pd3BmaWxlLmh0bWw/ZmlsZT1mZWIyMDE0L3d0bzIwMTRfMDMwNWEucGRm\">complained</a>\r\n to Froman that the labor movement was being shut out of negotiations \r\nand overwhelmed by industry groups with more access and influence on the\r\n trade deal\u2019s fine print.

These grievances were given \r\nfresh fuel by <a href=\"http://wikileaks.org/Second-release-of-secret-Trans.html?update\">WikiLeaks\u2019 </a>disclosures of chapter-by-chapter texts of the emerging trade pact (no text has been officially released). Subsequent <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2013/12/12/the-tpp-is-not-an-agreement-among-like-minded-countries/\">analysis</a>\r\n suggested the U.S. was trying to pull other nations in its direction \r\nand seeking concessions that would require wholesale rewrites of \r\nexisting laws\u2014all in exchange for access to the lucrative U.S. market.</p>", "<p>Skepticism\r\n about the benefits of free trade have been simmering for years, more so\r\n on the progressive Left than the tea-party Right, but both wings of \r\ntheir respective parties are agitated and opposed to TPP and the \r\nfast-track authority that would force Congress to consider the deal, \r\nupon its completion, without amendment and with expedited floor \r\nprocedures. Part of this is also a backlash against NAFTA\u2019s \r\nunderwhelming performance.</p>", "<p>The Congressional Research Service <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/133502581/CRS-NAFTA-at-20-2-21-13\">concluded</a>\r\n last year that NAFTA did far less than its enthusiastic backers \r\npromised when Congress approved the deal in 1993. That\u2019s what opponents \r\nfear with TPP. Twelve U.S. senators <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/200151609/TPA-Ltr-to-Leader-Reid-1-15-2014\">wrote Reid</a>\r\n announcing they would not support any new fast-track legislation \r\nwithout significant changes improving transparency, oversight, and \r\ncompensating legislation for workers victimized by global competition.</p>", "<p>All\r\n of this weighed heavily on Reid, a longtime opponent of free-trade \r\ndeals. Reid had a choice\u2014keep his long-standing opposition to himself, \r\nor offer vague estimates about when a vote on fast-track legislation \r\nwould occur. That certainly would have been Obama\u2019s preference after he \r\njumped feet-first into the fast-track debate in his <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/200151609/TPA-Ltr-to-Leader-Reid-1-15-2014\">State of the Union</a> address. Reid told Obama and the free-traders to <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/4f1ed8ca-89e9-11e3-abc4-00144feab7de,Authorised=false.html?_i_location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcms%2Fs%2F0%2F4f1ed8ca-89e9-11e3-abc4-00144feab7de.html%3Fsiteedition%3Duk&amp;siteedition=uk&amp;_i_referer=#axzz2sVoZQ2hR\">take a hike</a>.</p>", "<p>But\r\n Reid knows the politics of trade have become more complex, with issues \r\nof job losses competing with progressive antagonism toward global \r\ncorporatism and bubbling anxieties about secretive negotiations that \r\necho those about the American surveillance state. Ignoring any of these \r\nwould cause grassroots political problems for Reid among union members, \r\nyoung voters, and progressive populists. That\u2019s a toxic mix <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/02/obama-harry-reid-problem-103126.html#ixzz2sTdcUt6A\">Reid can\u2019t abide</a>.\r\n And won\u2019t. Fast-track\u2019s biggest Democratic booster in the Senate, Max \r\nBaucus, is heading to China as U.S. ambassador\u2014a farewell that will \r\nbring not one tear to Reid\u2019s eye but will intensify his stranglehold on \r\nthe fast-track schedule.</p>", "<p>The\r\n simplistic take is, Reid is merely waiting for the midterm elections \r\nbefore scheduling a fast-track vote to lay the groundwork for TPP and, \r\npossibly, a less advanced trade deal with Europe called the <a href=\"https://mail.google.com/mail/?shva=1#apps/major/1440437129a00609?projector=1\">Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership</a>. Think again.</p>", "<p>The\r\n negotiations for the Asia-based TPP recommence in Singapore on Feb. 17.\r\n The best lever the U.S. has in reaching a deal is fast-track \r\nauthority\u2014because it gives other nations a sense of confidence that the \r\ndeal will hold. That\u2019s now impossible.</p>", "<p>Anyone\r\n who thinks free-trade politics for Obama will improve after the \r\nmidterms should think again. If Republicans make gains in the House and \r\nSenate, yes, there will be more pro-business sympathy. But Democrats, \r\nafter licking their wounds, will sound a more progressive and populist \r\ntrumpet.</p>", "<p>Obama\u2019s trade agenda, therefore, is going up in smoke.

He said it wasn't worth sending young kids to die for. \"For a young Iowan ...we're asking these kids to sacrifice their life or parts of their body and I frankly think the Iraqis need to step up,\" he said. \"It doesn't really excite me that someone from Iowa needs to go there and defend Mosul.

But in the poll, 72 percent of the Republican Iowa caucus goers support sending U.S. ground troops into Iraq and Syria. However, 23 percent would not send ground troops and most of them would \"strongly oppose\" sending ground troops which suggests it might be a voting issue for them which means those voters could make up the base of the Paul camp. Winning 24% of the vote was sufficient to win the caucus in 2012. With the massively crowded field in 2016 the winner might get less than that.</p>", "<p> The normal caveats apply here to polling.

And Treasury bonds are soaring as investors scatter towards safety. </p>", "<p>The catalyst was a 1.9 percent reduction in the value of the yuan following weak trade and inflation data over the weekend. That amounts to the largest one-day drop since China ended its dual-currency system in January 1994, and it returns the yuan's value to where it was in April 2013. </p>", "<p>The Dow lost 212 points on the day, or 1.2 percent, to finish at 17,402.

Producer price inflation slid to its lowest level since October 2009 down 5.4 percent year-over-year vs. the 5 percent drop expected and the 4.8 percent drop posted in June.

Since the yuan is loosely pegged to the dollar, the recent strength in the greenback has pushed the currency into overvalued territory, according to an analysis by Barclays. </p>", "<p>While the move could help exports, the immediate effects, such as capital outflows, reactionary devaluations from trade partners, and possible credit market disruptions, are likely to happen first. </p>", "<p>Moreover, while the move was labeled as a \"one-time\" move aimed at enabling the market to better value the yuan, it's an open question whether further devaluations will follow as Beijing tries to merge its on-shore and off-shore currency markets. </p>", "<p>For the U.S., weakening China's currency risks further strengthening the dollar, which would weigh on exports. It could also push down overseas corporate profits. These potential near-term negatives have spooked U.S. investors and pushed stocks lower. </p>", "<p>Indeed, Moody's Gerry Granovsky said today that the yuan devaluation \"is credit negative for technology companies with significant operations in China, such as Apple, which already have to cope with a strong U.S. dollar.\" The move \"further increases the cost of iPhones and iPads in the local market.\"</p>", "<p>Apple (<a href=\"http://markets.cbsnews.com/aapl/quote/\">AAPL</a>) shares fell 5.2 percent to close at $113.49.</p>", "<p>PNC Financial Services Group economist Gus Faucher also notes that all of this could restrain already tepid inflation in the U.S., something the Federal Reserve has been patiently waiting to return to their 2 percent target. That, in turn, could push back the central bank's timing for raising interest rates, which many forecasters had predicted would come in September.</p>", "<p>\"The timing of Fed liftoff has always been a relatively close call in our view -- and with the devaluation of the Chinese yuan this morning, it just got a little closer,\" analysts with Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a note. \"A stronger U.S. dollar is both disinflationary and a drag on U.S. growth.\"</p>", "<p>But Julian Evans-Pritchard at Capital Economics thinks investors may be overreacting, noting that the yuan adjustment is largely a technical change in the way China sets its currency value. Instead of setting the value, the PBoC will now base it off of the previous closing price and overnight shifts in the foreign exchange markets.</p>", "<p>In his words, \"Because the reference rate was previously set well above the market rate, the new approach meant the reference rate had to be lowered sharply.\" </p>", "<p>Whether the market turbulence continues depends, in large part, on whether the PBoC moves to shore up its currency or allows the decline to precipitate.</p>"], "article_author": ["Anthony Mirhaydari"]}

For these children with severe cases of tooth decay, dentists turn to general anasthesia since it is unlikely a child will sit through drillings on multiple teeth.</p>", "<p>The Times reports that there is no \"central clearinghouse\" for data on the issue, but interviews conducted with dentists and others \"suggest that the problem is widespread.\"</p>", "<p>HealthPop spoke to Dr. Stanley Alexander, chair of pediatric dentistry at Tufts University  School of Dental Medicine in Boston, who said his dentists are in the operating room at least two mornings a week seeing up to nine preschool-aged patients in need of surgery for cavities.

Dentists point the finger towards parents who aren't brushing their kids' teeth twice a day.

Others caved into their crying kids who hated the at-home care.</p>", "<p>\"Let's say a child is 1 1/2, and the child screams when they get their teeth cleaned,\" Dr. Jed Best, a pediatric dentist in Manhattan, told the Times. \"Some parents say, 'I don't want my little darling to be traumatized.'

According to the Times, one surgeon said one 3-year-old boy arrived for his second round of dental surgery while holding a bottle of soda. </p>", "<p>Alexander told HealthPop that parents sometimes give their kids a bottle of juice to help them fall asleep, which is especially problematic since children's enamel is thin to begin with, and the mouth's natural cleaning processes are less active when people sleep.
